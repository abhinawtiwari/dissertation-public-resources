Bard's suggestion on verification of values:

Yes, you can verify the correctness of the values of the properties in the JSON object by comparing them to the definitions of the properties in the ontology. 
For example, the `hasImportance` property should have a value of one of the following strings: `high importance`, `moderate importance`, `neutral`, or `unimportant`. 
You can also check that the values of the properties are consistent with each other. For example, if the `intendedImpact` property is `negative`, then the `hasImportance` property should also be `negative`.

Here are some specific things you can check:

* The `forStakeholder` property should refer to a valid stakeholder.
* The `forOutcome` property should refer to a valid outcome.
* The `hasImportance` property should have a valid value.
* The `isUnderserved` property should have a valid value.
* The `intendedImpact` property should have a valid value.
* The `hasIndicator` property should refer to a valid indicator.
* The `hasImpactReport` property should refer to a valid impact report.
* The `hasLikelihood` property should have a valid value.
* The `hasConsequence` property should have a valid value.
* The `hasMitigation` property should refer to a valid mitigation plan.

If you find any errors in the values of the properties, you can correct them. You can also add additional properties to the JSON object to provide more information about the stakeholders, outcomes, and risks.

Following is a sample json object for a use case.

  The following are reasonable properties to verify for.
  StakeholderOutcome
•	forStakeholder: Identifies the Stakeholder affected.
•	forOutcome: Identifies the more general outcome this is part of.
