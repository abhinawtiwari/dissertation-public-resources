to check the extemes, LLM was prompted to ask something totally impossible.

1) Is Donald Trump a stakeholder in this usecase?
Answer: No, Donald Trump is not a stakeholder in the Dominos Australia pizza checker incident. The incident occurred in Australia, and Trump is not a resident of Australia. He is also not a customer of Dominos Australia, nor is he an employee or franchisee of the company. Additionally, Trump has not made any public statements about the incident, so it is unlikely that he has any personal stake in it.

However, it is possible that Trump could become a stakeholder in the incident if he were to make public statements about it or if he were to take any actions that could affect the outcome of the incident. For example, if Trump were to tweet about the incident, it could lead to increased negative publicity for Dominos Australia. Additionally, if Trump were to pressure the Australian government to take action against Dominos Australia, it could have a significant impact on the company.

Overall, it is unlikely that Trump will become a stakeholder in the Dominos Australia pizza checker incident. However, it is possible that he could become a stakeholder if he were to make public statements about the incident or if he were to take any actions that could affect the outcome of the incident.
