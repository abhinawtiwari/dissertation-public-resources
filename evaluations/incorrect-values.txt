Objective: verification of incorrect values.
Two categories here: verfiable and unverfiable

the ones about importance/severity/likelihood/consequence being high/medium/low are quite subjective to the opinions of the audience.
It's difficult even for a human to discern.
Other field such as the ones having the region the incident occured in is verifiable from the article.

Verification - manual and automated
manual needs long reading of the articles and slow.
Automated verification can increase the productivity of manual verification and also present an idea of accuracy of the results.
