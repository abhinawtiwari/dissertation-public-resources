- Bloomberg reports that US gig shopping company Instacart is planning to replace its army of gig personal shoppers with robots.
- Leaked documents reveal Instacast is looking to build a series of large-scale, automated fulfillment centers across the US in which robots would fetch items such as cereal boxes, and humans collect fresh produce and deli products.
- According to the documents, larger facilities would process orders for several locations while others would be attached to existing supermarkets and grocery stores.
- Instacart uses hundreds of thousands of gig workers to pick up and deliver orders to customers at their homes and offices. Automation is envisaged to cut costs, increase delivery times, and attract more customers.
- Analysts believe the plan may help reduce the likelihood that Instacart will be squeezed out by its grocery partners.
- In early 2019, Instacart changed its pay algorithm after personal shoppers boycotted the company claiming it lowered their pay and customers complained on social media their orders were being delayed.

- Instacart contracts hundreds of thousands of gig workers to fulfill customers' grocery orders, but the firm is working on replacing a number of human shoppers with robots in a bid to compete with Amazon's automated fulfillment service.
- The news, unearthed in company documents obtained by Bloomberg, states Instacart is eyeing automation as a way to cut costs for customers and help it form stronger relationships with supermarket chains.
- According to people familiar with the matter, the firm's strategy includes building an unknown number of automated fulfillment centers across the US, with some attached to existing grocery stores.
- Others would be standalone facilities that complete orders for several surrounding grocery stores.
- Robots would gather non-perishable goods, while human workers would collect produce and deli items in Instacart fulfilment centers.
- An Instacart spokesperson told DailyMail.com: 'We’re constantly exploring new tools and technologies that support the needs of the 600 retailers we partner with and further enable their businesses to grow and scale over the long-term.
- 'Shoppers are and will continue to be central to Instacart and our service, and any suggestion otherwise is wholly inaccurate.'
- Instacart employs hundreds of thousands of gig workers to fulfil customers' grocery orders, but internal documents show the firm is working on replacing a number of human shoppers with robots
- Bloomberg reports the documents it received were dated in July and December 2020, which suggests Instacart has been working on the plan for nearly a year.
- The documents also reveal Instacart was set to test fulfillment centers in 2020, but the firm is behind schedule.
- It also has yet to sign on a supermarket chain or strike a deal with a robotics company to build the technology.
- Amazon purchased Kiva Systems (later renamed Amazon Robotics) in 2012 for $775 million to perform these tasks in its warehouses. As of 2019, it had more than 200,000 robots in their warehouses, according to The Washington Post.
- Instacart currently offers orders to gig workers who travel to a nearby grocery store and then scan items on the customer's shopping list.
- According to people familiar with the matter, the firm's strategy includes building fulfillment centers across the US, with some attached to existing grocery stores and others as standalone facilities that complete orders for several surrounding grocery stores
- The model has shot the firm up in popularity, but becoming America's second largest grocery delivery service comes with a hefty price tag.
- Marc Wulfraat, president of the logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc., told Bloomberg that with delivery fees, price markups and added tips, customers are paying up to 25 percent more when ordering through Instacart.
- Speaking to Bloomberg, an Instacart spokeswoman declined to provide specifics but said the company is 'committed to supporting our brick-and-mortar partners and continuing to invest in and explore new tools and technologies that support the needs of their customers and further enable their businesses to grow and scale over the long-term.'
- Instacart may be behind schedule, but the documents obtained suggest a network of stand-alone fulfillment centers could complete more than 3,500 orders a day.
- This would involve more than 700 robots and about 160 human works collecting items throughout facilities.
- However, the firm is also considering smaller centers that attach to grocery stores to complete more than 700 orders a day with the use of 150 robots and 40 humans working at each.

- Robots could soon be shopping for your groceries.
- Instacart, the San Francisco-based grocery delivery and pick-up company, is reportedly exploring new technology to enlist robots for its in-store grocery shopping to replace some of its gig workers in a move to cut costs, according to documents detailing the plan obtained by Bloomberg.

- The strategy reportedly consists of constructing automated fulfillment centers across the country enlisting hundreds of robots to transport food items such as cans of soup or boxes of cereal while gig workers handle produce and deli items, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Some of the automated centers would be attached to brick-and-mortar grocery stores, though it’s unclear which supermarket chains will work in tandem with the company, according to the report. The documents cited were dated July and December 2020 and sources familiar with the company said Instacart is behind on the plans.
- Currently, Instacart utilizes thousands of gig workers to shop through grocery stores for delivery and pick up, however, consumers pay up to 25% in delivery fees, tips, and price hikes per order, Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc., told Bloomberg.

- Automating grocery delivery production is the latest move in a hospitality industry-wide trend with labor shortages at restaurants, fast food chains and grocery stores. The labor shortage has also set grocery store prices rising in recent months. The last consumer price index released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed food items like fruits and vegetables increased by 1% in the month of March while meat, poultry, fish and eggs went up by 0.7%.

- "Currently, labor challenges in several sectors are contributing to higher costs and reduced inventory fill rates. Additionally, labor and transportation challenges contribute to the volatility of transportation assets, making it difficult to reach the reliability of inbound shipments that existed pre-COVID," Nate Rosier, a senior vice president of the supply chain consulting firm enVista told FOX Business last month. "The culmination of these factors is leading to higher costs and more unstable inventory in grocery stores across the country."

- Instacart reportedly has a plan to replace many of its gig workers with robots.
- The supermarket delivery app has been angling for nearly a year to build fulfillment centers that rely on robots instead of personal shoppers to pluck packaged goods from shelves, although the plan faces major delays, according to a Bloomberg report.
- The San Francisco-based giant, which has been slammed with protests over accusations that it has been nickel-and-diming its workers, would largely eliminate personal shoppers under the initiative except for those that gather fresh food, according to the report.
- One proposal, according to documents Bloomberg obtained, would create a network of stand-alone fulfillment centers that would handle more than 3,500 orders a day using 700 robots and just 160 people. A second option calls for a smaller facility using just 150 robots and 40 workers and would be likely be located at the grocery store.
- Supermarkets would be responsible for forecasting orders and handling inventory while Instacart would process the customer orders and handle the drivers, according to the report. A technology provider would build the fulfillment centers.
- However, the initiative is running behind schedule, as no supermarket has signed on to test it and no technology partner has been selected for the project that is supposed to get underway later this year, according to Bloomberg.
- In a statement to The Post, Instacart said, “We’re constantly exploring new tools and technologies that support the needs of the 600 retailers we partner with and further enable their businesses to grow and scale over the long-term. Shoppers are and will continue to be central to Instacart and our service, and any suggestion otherwise is wholly inaccurate.”
- A spokesperson for the company told Bloomberg that the company is “committed to supporting our brick-and-mortar partners and continuing to invest in and explore new tools and technologies that support the needs of their customers.”
- Using personal shoppers jacks up the price of a customer order by as much as 25 percent, including gratuities, according to the report.
- Supermarkets have long been wary of Instacart, which generally controls the customer relationship.
- In recent years, some large chains have severed ties with Instacart in favor of a growing number of competitors, including Doordash and Shipt — which Target acquired in 2017, and some large companies, including Walmart, are working on their own initiatives involving robots.
- The pandemic fueled a huge spike in delivery business for Instacart, which is reportedly eyeing a potential initial public offering this year.
