- The Wall Street Journal reports that Ukraine's air force has been using Turkish-made automated drones to hit Russian targets during the Russian invasion of the east European country.
- The Ukrainian air force confirmed it had struck Russian targets, including a military convoy near Kherson, using Bayraktar TB2 drones during the early days Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
- Ukraine’s air force chief Lt. Gen. Mykola Oleshchuk described the drones as 'life-giving'. Human rights and non-governmental organisations have been calling for a global ban on lethal autonomous weapons systems (aka 'slaughterbots').
- In October 2021, Ukrainian officials said its air force had used TB2 drones to destroy a Russian howitzer in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.
- A UN report published in March 2021 reported that Turkish-made STM Kargu-2 drones were used by Libyan forces loyal to the Government of National Accord (GNA) to hunt down units loyal to former Libyan Field Marshall Khalifa Haftar.
- In January 2021, a Bayraktar TB2 drone was used to attack civilians sheltering in a school in Tigray, Ethiopia, leaving at least 59 dead, according to analysis by the Washington Post.

- On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded and occupied parts of Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which had begun in 2014. The invasion has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides, and instigated Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. About 8 million Ukrainians were displaced within their country by June, and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by May 2023.
- For months before the invasion, Russian troops had been concentrating around Ukraine's borders while Russian officials repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine. On 24 February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a "special military operation" to support the Russian-controlled breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose military forces had been fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict. He said the goal was to "demilitarise" and "denazify" Ukraine. Putin espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis who persecuted the ethnic Russian minority. Minutes later, Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched along a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a north-eastern front towards Kharkiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from the Donbas. In response, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy enacted martial law and ordered a general mobilisation.
- Russian troops had retreated from the northern front by April. On the southern and south-eastern fronts, Russia captured Kherson in March and then Mariupol in May after a destructive siege. On 18 April, Russia launched a renewed battle of Donbas. Russian forces continued to bomb both military and civilian targets far from the front line, including Ukraine's energy grid throughout the winter. In late 2022, Ukraine launched counteroffensives in the south and in the east. Soon after, Russia announced the illegal annexation of four partly-occupied oblasts. In November, Ukraine retook parts of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson. On 7 February 2023, Russia mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers for a renewed offensive towards Bakhmut.
- The invasion has been met with widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution ES-11/1 condemning the invasion and demanding a full withdrawal of Russian forces. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. Protests occurred around the world; those in Russia were met with mass arrests and increased media censorship. Over 1,000 companies left Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of children, and genocide during the invasion, issuing an arrest warrant for Putin in March 2023.
- After the Soviet Union (USSR) dissolved in 1991, the newly independent republics of Ukraine and Russia maintained ties. Ukraine agreed in 1994 to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and dismantle the nuclear weapons in Ukraine left by the USSR.[10] In return, Russia, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) agreed in the Budapest Memorandum to uphold the territorial integrity of Ukraine.[11][12] In 1999, Russia signed the Charter for European Security, which "reaffirm[ed] the inherent right of each and every participating state to be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including treaties of alliance".[13] After the Soviet Union dissolved, several former Eastern Bloc countries joined NATO, partly due to regional security threats such as the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993) and the First Chechen War (1994–1996).[14] Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, claimed NATO members had promised in 1990 not to let any Eastern European countries join, but this is disputed.[15][16] At the 2008 Bucharest summit, Ukraine and Georgia sought to join NATO.[17] The response from NATO members was divided, with Western European countries worried about antagonising Russia.[18] NATO refused to offer Ukraine and Georgia membership, but also issued a statement agreeing that "these countries will become members of NATO" one day. Putin strongly opposed the NATO membership bids,[19] and Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia would do everything it could to prevent their admittance.[20]
- In November 2013, Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych suddenly cancelled the signing of an association agreement with the European Union (EU), overruling the Ukrainian parliament and instead choosing closer ties with the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union. Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to reject the agreement.[21] This triggered a wave of protests known as Euromaidan, culminating in the removal of Yanukovych in February 2014 and subsequent pro-Russian unrest in eastern and southern parts of Ukraine. Russian soldiers without insignia took control of strategic positions and infrastructure in the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and seized the Crimean Parliament. In March, Russia organised a controversial referendum and annexed Crimea. This was followed by the outbreak of the war in Donbas, which began in April 2014 when armed Russia-backed separatists seized Ukrainian government buildings, proclaiming the independent Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic.[22][23] Russian troops were involved in the conflict.[24][25][26] The Minsk agreements signed in September 2014 and February 2015 were a bid to stop the fighting, but ceasefires repeatedly failed.[27] A dispute emerged over the role of Russia: Normandy Format members France, Germany, and Ukraine saw Minsk as an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, whereas Russia insisted Ukraine should negotiate directly with the two separatist republics.[28][29] In 2021, Putin refused offers from Zelenskyy to hold high-level talks, and the Russian government endorsed an article by former president Dmitry Medvedev arguing that it was pointless to deal with Ukraine while it remained a "vassal" of the United States.[30]
- The annexation of Crimea led to a new wave of Russian nationalism, with much of the Russian neo-imperial movement aspiring to annex more Ukrainian land to create Novorossiya (New Russia).[31] Analyst Vladimir Socor argued that Putin's 2014 speech after the annexation was a "manifesto of Greater-Russia Irredentism".[32] In July 2021, Putin published an essay titled "On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians", stating that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people".[33] In the build-up to the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine was created by the Russian Bolsheviks and that it "never had a tradition of genuine statehood".[34] American historian Timothy Snyder described Putin's ideas as imperialism.[35] British journalist Edward Lucas described it as historical revisionism.[36] Other observers note that the Russian leadership holds a distorted view of modern Ukraine, as well as its history.[37][38][39]
- In March and April 2021, Russia began a major military build-up near the Russo-Ukrainian border. A second build-up followed from October 2021 to February 2022, in both Russia and Belarus.[41] Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine;[42][43] including government spokesman Dmitry Peskov on 28 November 2021, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on 19 January 2022,[44] Russian ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov on 20 February 2022,[42] and Russian ambassador to the Czech Republic Alexander Zmeevsky on 23 February 2022.[45][46]
- Putin's chief national security adviser, Nikolai Patrushev, is known for his anti-Western views[47] and said that the West was in an undeclared conflict with Russia.[48] Russia's updated national security strategy, published in May 2021, said that Russia may use "forceful methods" to "thwart or avert unfriendly actions that threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation".[49][50] Sources say the decision to invade Ukraine was made by Putin and a small group of war hawks or siloviki in Putin's inner circle, including Patrushev and minister of defence Sergei Shoigu.[51]
- During the second build-up, Russia demanded that NATO sign a treaty barring Ukraine from ever joining NATO, and demanded multinational forces be removed from NATO's Eastern European member states.[52] Russia threatened an unspecified military response if NATO followed an "aggressive line".[53] These demands were widely seen as non-viable; Eastern European states had willingly joined NATO for security reasons, and their governments sought protection from Russian irredentism.[54] A treaty to prevent Ukraine joining would go against NATO's "open door" policy, despite NATO's unenthusiastic response to Ukrainian requests to join.[55] NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that "Russia has no say" on whether Ukraine joins, and that "Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbors".[56] NATO's official policy is that it does not seek confrontation, and NATO and Russia had co-operated until Russia annexed Crimea.[57]
- Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz made efforts to prevent war in February 2022. Macron met Putin but failed to convince him not to go ahead with the invasion. Scholz warned Putin that heavy sanctions would be imposed should he invade Ukraine. Scholz, in trying to negotiate a settlement, also told Zelenskyy to declare neutrality and renounce aspirations to join NATO; however, Zelenskyy said Putin could not be trusted to uphold such a settlement.[58]
- On 21 February, Putin made an address announcing that Russia recognized the Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine as independent states: the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The following day, Russia announced it was sending troops into the territories as "peacekeepers",[59] while the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force abroad.[60]
- On 24 February, before 5 a.m. Kyiv time,[61] Putin made another address, announcing that Russia was launching a "special military operation", and "effectively declared war on Ukraine".[62][63] He said the purpose of the operation was to "protect the people" of the Donbas, in the Russian-controlled breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. He falsely claimed they had been "been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime"[64] Putin falsely claimed that Ukraine's government were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.[65] He said Russia sought the "demilitarisation and denazification" of Ukraine.[66] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination.[65] Within minutes of Putin's announcement, Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,[67] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east and south.[68] Later an alleged report from Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) was leaked, claiming that the intelligence agency had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.[69]
- The invasion began at dawn on 24 February,[62] with infantry divisions and armoured and air support in Eastern Ukraine, and dozens of missile attacks across Ukraine,[70][71] which reached as far west as Lviv.[72][73] The first fighting took place in Luhansk Oblast near Milove village on the border with Russia at 3:40 a.m. Kyiv time.[74] The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearhead incursions, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv from Belarus, a southern front from Crimea, a south-eastern front from the Russian-controlled Donbas, and an eastern front launched from Russia towards Kharkiv and Sumy.[75][76] Russian vehicles were marked with a white Z military symbol (a non-Cyrillic letter), believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire.[41]
- When the invasion began, Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine.[77] The same evening, he ordered a general mobilisation of all Ukrainian males between 18 and 60 years old,[78] prohibiting them from leaving the country.[79] Wagner Group mercenaries and Chechen forces reportedly made several attempts to assassinate Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian government said these efforts were thwarted by anti-war officials in Russia's FSB, who shared intelligence of the plans.[80] The Russian invasion was unexpectedly met by fierce Ukrainian resistance.[81] In Kyiv, Russia failed to take the city as its attacks were repulsed at the suburbs during the battles of Irpin, Hostomel and Bucha. The Russian army tried to encircle the capital, but Ukrainian forces managed to hold ground. Ukraine utilised Western arms to great effectiveness, including the Javelin anti-tank missile and the Stinger anti-aircraft missile, thinning Russian supply lines and stalling the offensive.[82] The defense of the Ukrainian capital was under the command of Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi.[83]
- On 9 March, a column of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles was ambushed in Brovary, suffered heavy losses and was forced to retreat.[84] The Russian army adopted siege tactics on the Western front around the key cities of Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv, but failed to capture them due to stiff resistance and logistical setbacks.[85] On the southern front, Russian forces captured the major city of Kherson on 2 March. In Mykolaiv Oblast, they advanced as far as Voznesensk but were repelled south of Mykolaiv. On 25 March, the Russian Defence Ministry stated that the first stage of the "military operation" in Ukraine was "generally complete", that the Ukrainian military forces had suffered serious losses, and that the Russian military would now concentrate on the "liberation of Donbas".[86][87] The "first stage" of the invasion was conducted on four fronts[88][89] including one towards western Kyiv from Belarus by the Russian Eastern Military District, comprising the 29th, 35th, and 36th Combined Arms Armies. A second axis, deployed towards eastern Kyiv from Russia by the Central Military District (north-eastern front), comprised the 41st Combined Arms Army and the 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army.[90]
- A third axis was deployed towards Kharkiv by the Western Military District (eastern front), with the 1st Guards Tank Army and 20th Combined Arms Army. A fourth, southern front originating in occupied Crimea and Russia's Rostov oblast with an eastern axis towards Odesa and a western area of operations toward Mariupol was opened by the Southern Military District, including the 58th, 49th, and 8th Combined Arms Army, the latter also commanding the 1st and 2nd Army Corps of the Russian separatist forces in Donbas.[90] By 7 April, Russian troops deployed to the northern front by the Russian Eastern Military District pulled back from the Kyiv offensive, apparently to resupply and redeploy to the Donbas region to reinforce the renewed invasion of south-eastern Ukraine. The north-eastern front, including the Central Military District, was similarly withdrawn for resupply and redeployment to south-eastern Ukraine.[90][91] On 18 April, retired Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, the former US ambassador to NATO, reported in a PBS NewsHour interview that Russia had repositioned its troops to initiate a new assault on Eastern Ukraine which would be limited to Russia's original deployment of 150,000 to 190,000 troops for the invasion, though the troops were being well supplied from adequate weapon stockpiles in Russia. For Lute, this contrasted sharply with the vast size of the Ukrainian conscription of all-male Ukrainian citizens between 16 and 60 years of age, but without adequate weapons in Ukraine's highly limited stockpiles of weapons.[92] On 26 April, delegates of the US and 40 allied nations met at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to discuss forming a coalition to provide economic support and military supplies and refitting to Ukraine.[93] Following Putin's Victory Day speech in early May, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said no short term resolution to the invasion should be expected.[94]
- Ukraine's reliance on Western-supplied equipment constrained operational effectiveness, as supplying countries feared that Ukraine would use Western-made matériel to strike targets in Russia.[95] Military experts disagreed on the future of the conflict; some suggested that Ukraine should trade territory for peace,[96] while others believed that Ukraine could maintain its resistance thanks to the Russian losses.[97]
- By 30 May, disparities between Russian and Ukrainian artillery were apparent with Ukrainian artillery being vastly outgunned by range and number.[98] In response to US President Joe Biden's indication that enhanced artillery would be provided to Ukraine, Putin indicated that Russia would expand its invasion front to include new cities in Ukraine and in apparent retribution ordered a missile strike against Kyiv on 6 June after not directly attacking the city for several weeks.[99] On 10 June 2022, Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine's military intelligence, stated during the Severodonetsk campaign that the frontlines were where the future of the invasion would be decided: "This is an artillery war now, and we are losing in terms of artillery. Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us. Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have."[100] On 29 June, Reuters reported that Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, updating U.S. intelligence assessment of the Russian invasion, said that U.S. intelligence agencies agree that the invasion will continue "for an extended period of time ... In short, the picture remains pretty grim and Russia's attitude toward the West is hardening."[101] On 5 July, BBC reported that extensive destruction by the Russian invasion would cause immense financial damage to Ukraine's reconstruction economy stating: "Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has told a reconstruction conference in Switzerland."[102]
- On 20 February, Biden visited Kyiv in person on a diplomatic mission to assure Zelenskyy and his government of sustaining US financial and military supplies support on the eve of the end of the first year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[103]
- The invasion began on 24 February, launched out of Belarus to target Kyiv, and from the northeast against the city of Kharkiv. The southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearheads, from Crimea and the southeast against Luhansk and Donetsk.[75][76]
- Russian efforts to capture Kyiv included a probative spearhead on 24 February, from Belarus south along the west bank of the Dnipro River, apparently to encircle the city from the west, supported by two separate axes of attack from Russia along the east bank of the Dnipro: the western at Chernihiv, and the eastern at Sumy. These were likely intended to encircle Kyiv from the north-east and east.[71][70]
- "The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride."

- Russia apparently tried to seize Kyiv quickly, with Spetsnaz infiltrating into the city supported by airborne operations and a rapid mechanised advance from the north, but was unsuccessful.[104][105][106][107] Around this time, the United States contacted President Zelenskyy and offered assistance with helping him flee the country, should the Russian Army attempt to kidnap or kill him upon the planned seizure of Kyiv. According to a senior American intelligence official with direct knowledge of the conversation, Zelenskyy reportedly said in response to the request to evacuate, "The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride."[108] The Washington Post, which described the quote as "one of the most-cited lines of the Russian invasion", was not entirely sure of the comment's accuracy. Reporter Glenn Kessler said it came from "a single source, but on the surface it appears to be a good one".[109] Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from Belarus gained control of the ghost towns of Chernobyl and Pripyat.[110][111] Russian Airborne Forces attempted to seize two key airfields near Kyiv, launching an airborne assault on Antonov Airport,[112][113] and a similar landing at Vasylkiv, near Vasylkiv Air Base, on 26 February.[114][115]
- By early March, Russian advances along the west side of the Dnipro were limited by Ukrainian defences.[71][70] As of 5 March, a large Russian convoy, reportedly 64 kilometres (40 mi) long, had made little progress toward Kyiv.[116] The London-based think tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) assessed Russian advances from the north and east as "stalled".[117] Advances from Chernihiv largely halted as a siege began there. Russian forces continued to advance on Kyiv from the northwest, capturing Bucha, Hostomel, and Vorzel by 5 March,[118][119] though Irpin remained contested as of 9 March.[120] By 11 March, the lengthy convoy had largely dispersed and taken cover.[121] On 16 March, Ukrainian forces began a counter-offensive to repel Russian forces.[122] Unable to achieve a quick victory in Kyiv, Russian forces switched their strategy to indiscriminate bombing and siege warfare.[123][124]
- On 25 March, a Ukrainian counter-offensive retook several towns to the east and west of Kyiv, including Makariv.[125][126] Russian troops in the Bucha area retreated north at the end of March. Ukrainian forces entered the city on 1 April.[127] Ukraine said it had recaptured the entire region around Kyiv, including Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel, and uncovered evidence of war crimes in Bucha.[128] On 6 April, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that the Russian "retraction, resupply, and redeployment" of their troops from the Kyiv area should be interpreted as an expansion of Putin's plans for Ukraine, by redeploying and concentrating his forces on Eastern Ukraine.[91] Kyiv was generally left free from attack apart from isolated missile strikes. One did occur while UN Secretary-General António Guterres was visiting Kyiv on 28 April to discuss with Zelenskyy the survivors of the siege of Mariupol. One person was killed and several were injured in the attack[129][130]
- Russian forces advanced into Chernihiv Oblast on 24 February and besieged its administrative capital. The next day Russian forces attacked and captured Konotop.[131][132] A separate advance into Sumy Oblast the same day attacked the city of Sumy, just 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russo-Ukrainian border. The advance bogged down in urban fighting, and Ukrainian forces successfully held the city, claiming more than 100 Russian armoured vehicles were destroyed and dozens of soldiers were captured.[133] Russian forces also attacked Okhtyrka, deploying thermobaric weapons.[134]
- On 4 March, Frederick Kagan wrote that the Sumy axis was then "the most successful and dangerous Russian avenue of advance on Kyiv", and commented that the geography favoured mechanised advances as the terrain "is flat and sparsely populated, offering few good defensive positions".[70] Travelling along highways, Russian forces reached Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, on 4 March.[71][70] The Pentagon confirmed on 6 April that the Russian army had left Chernihiv Oblast, but Sumy Oblast remained contested.[135] On 7 April, the governor of Sumy Oblast said that Russian troops were gone, but left behind rigged explosives and other hazards.[136]
- On 24 February, Russian forces took control of the North Crimean Canal. Troops used explosives to destroy the dam that was blocking the river, allowing Crimea to obtain water from the Dnieper which had been cut off since 2014.[137] On 26 February, the siege of Mariupol began as the attack moved east linking to separatist-held Donbas.[134][138] En route, Russian forces entered Berdiansk and captured it.[139] On 1 March, Russian forces attacked Melitopol and nearby cities.[140][141] On 25 February, Russian units from the DPR moves on Mariupol and were defeated near Pavlopil.[142][143][144] By evening, the Russian Navy reportedly began an amphibious assault on the coast of the Sea of Azov 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of Mariupol. A US defence official said that Russian forces might be deploying thousands of marines from this beachhead.[145][146][147]
- The Russian 22nd Army Corps approached the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on 26 February[148][149] and besieged Enerhodar in order to assume control.[150] A fire began,[151] but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) stated that essential equipment was undamaged.[152] Despite the fires, the plant recorded no radiation leaks.[153] A third Russian attack group from Crimea moved northwest and captured bridges over the Dnieper.[154] On 2 March, Russian troops won a battle at Kherson; this was the first major city to fall to Russian forces in the invasion.[155] Russian troops moved on Mykolaiv, attacking it two days later. They were repelled by Ukrainian forces.[156] On 2 March, Ukrainian forces initiated a counter-offensive on Horlivka,[157] controlled by the DPR since 2014.[158]
- After renewed missile attacks on 14 March in Mariupol, the Ukrainian government said more than 2,500 had died.[159] By 18 March, Mariupol was completely encircled and fighting reached the city centre, hampering efforts to evacuate civilians.[160] On 20 March, an art school sheltering around 400 people, was destroyed by Russian bombs.[161] The Russians demanded surrender, and the Ukrainians refused.[75][76] On 24 March, Russian forces entered central Mariupol.[162] On 27 March, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said that "(m)ore than 85 percent of the whole town is destroyed."[163]
- Putin told Emmanuel Macron in a phone call on 29 March that the bombardment of Mariupol would only end when the Ukrainians surrendered.[164] On 1 April, Russian troops refused safe passage into Mariupol to 50 buses sent by the United Nations to evacuate civilians, as peace talks continued in Istanbul.[165] On 3 April, following the retreat of Russian forces from Kyiv, Russia expanded its attack on Southern Ukraine further west, with bombardment and strikes against Odesa, Mykolaiv, and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.[166][167]
- In the east, Russian troops attempted to capture Kharkiv, less than 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russian border,[168][169] and met strong Ukrainian resistance. On 25 February, the Millerovo air base was attacked by Ukrainian military forces with OTR-21 Tochka missiles, which according to Ukrainian officials, destroyed several Russian Air Force planes and started a fire.[72][73] On 28 February, missile attacks killed several people in Kharkiv.[170] On 1 March, Denis Pushilin, head of the DPR, announced that DPR forces had almost completely surrounded the city of Volnovakha.[171] On 2 March, Russian forces were repelled from Sievierodonetsk during an attack against the city.[172] Izium was reportedly captured by Russian forces on 17 March,[173] although fighting continued.[174]
- On 25 March, the Russian defence ministry said it would seek to occupy major cities in Eastern Ukraine.[175] On 31 March, the Ukrainian military confirmed Izium was under Russian control,[176][177] and PBS News reported renewed shelling and missile attacks in Kharkiv, as bad or worse than before, as peace talks with Russia were to resume in Istanbul.[178]
- Amid the heightened Russian shelling of Kharkiv on 31 March, Russia reported a helicopter strike against an oil supply depot approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) north of the border in Belgorod, and accused Ukraine of the attack.[179] Ukraine denied responsibility.[180] By 7 April, the renewed massing of Russian invasion troops and tank divisions around the towns of Izium, Sloviansk, and Kramatorsk prompted Ukrainian government officials to advise the remaining residents near the eastern border of Ukraine to evacuate to western Ukraine within 2–3 days, given the absence of arms and munitions previously promised to Ukraine by then.[181]
- By 17 April, Russian progress on the south-eastern front appeared to be impeded by opposing Ukrainian forces in the large, heavily fortified Azovstal steel mill and surrounding area in Mariupol.[182]
- On 19 April, The New York Times confirmed that Russia had launched a renewed invasion front referred to as an "eastern assault" across a 480-kilometre (300 mi) front extending from Kharkiv to Donetsk and Luhansk, with simultaneous missile attacks again directed at Kyiv in the north and Lviv in Western Ukraine.[183] As of 30 April, a NATO official described Russian advances as "uneven" and "minor".[184] An anonymous US Defence Official called the Russian offensive "very tepid", "minimal at best", and "anaemic".[185]
In June 2022 the chief spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defence Igor Konashenkov revealed that Russian troops were divided between the Army Groups "Center" commanded by Colonel General Aleksander Lapin and "South" commanded by Army General Sergey Surovikin.[186] On 20 July, Lavrov announced that Russia would respond to the increased military aid being received by Ukraine from abroad as justifying the expansion of its special military operation to include objectives in both the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.[187]
- Russian Ground Forces started recruiting volunteer battalions from the regions in June 2022 to create a new 3rd Army Corps within the Western Military District, with a planned strength estimated at 15,500–60,000 personnel.[188][189] Its units were deployed to the front around the time of Ukraine's 9 September Kharkiv oblast counteroffensive, in time to join the Russian retreat, leaving behind tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and personnel carriers: the 3rd Army Corps "melted away" according to Forbes, having little or no impact on the battlefield along with other irregular forces.[190][191]
- On 13 April, Russian forces intensified their attack on the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol, and the Ukrainian defence forces that remained there.[192] By 17 April, Russian forces had surrounded the factory. Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said that the Ukrainian soldiers had vowed to ignore the renewed ultimatum to surrender and to fight to the last soul.[193] On 20 April, Putin said that the siege of Mariupol could be considered tactically complete, since the 500 Ukrainian troops entrenched in bunkers within the Azovstal iron works and estimated 1,000 Ukrainian civilians were completely sealed off from any type of relief in their siege.[194]
- After consecutive meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy, UN Secretary-General Guterres on 28 April said he would attempt to organise an emergency evacuation of survivors from Azovstal in accordance with assurances he had received from Putin on his visit to the Kremlin.[195] On 30 April, Russian troops allowed civilians to leave under UN protection.[196] By 3 May, after allowing approximately 100 Ukrainian civilians to depart from the Azovstal steel factory, Russian troops renewed non-stop bombardment of the steel factory.[197] On 6 May, The Telegraph reported that Russia had used thermobaric bombs against the remaining Ukrainian soldiers, who had lost contact with the Kyiv government; in his last communications, Zelenskyy had authorised the commander of the besieged steel factory to surrender as necessary under the pressure of increased Russian attacks.[198] On 7 May, the Associated Press reported that all civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal steel works at the end of the three-day ceasefire.[199]
- After the last civilians evacuated from the Azovstal bunkers, nearly two thousand Ukrainian soldiers remained barricaded there, with 700 injured; they were able to communicate a plea for a military corridor to evacuate, as they expected summary execution if they surrendered to the Russians.[200] Reports of dissent within the Ukrainian troops at Azovstal were reported by Ukrainskaya Pravda on 8 May indicating that the commander of the Ukrainian Marines assigned to defend the Azovstal bunkers made an unauthorised acquisition of tanks, munitions, and personnel, broke out from the position there and fled. The remaining soldiers spoke of a weakened defensive position in Azovstal as a result, which allowed progress to advancing Russian lines of attack.[201] Ilia Somolienko, deputy commander of the remaining Ukrainian troops barricaded at Azovstal, said: "We are basically here dead men. Most of us know this and it's why we fight so fearlessly."[202]
- On 16 May, the Ukrainian General staff announced that the Mariupol garrison had "fulfilled its combat mission" and that final evacuations from the Azovstal steel factory had begun. The military said that 264 service members were evacuated to Olenivka under Russian control, while 53 of them who were "seriously injured" had been taken to a hospital in Novoazovsk also controlled by Russian forces.[203][204] Following the evacuation of Ukrainian personnel from Azovstal, Russian and DPR forces fully controlled all areas of Mariupol. The end of the battle also brought an end to the Siege of Mariupol. Russia press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin had guaranteed that the fighters who surrendered would be treated "in accordance with international standards" while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address that "the work of bringing the boys home continues, and this work needs delicacy—and time". Some prominent Russian lawmakers called on the government to deny prisoner exchanges for members of the Azov Regiment.[205]
- A Russian missile attack on Kramatorsk railway station in the city of Kramatorsk took place on 8 April, reportedly killing at least 52[206] and injuring 87 to 300.[207] On 11 April, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine expected a major new Russian offensive in the east.[208] American officials said that Russia had withdrawn or been repulsed elsewhere in Ukraine, and therefore was preparing a retraction, resupply, and redeployment of infantry and tank divisions to the south-eastern Ukraine front.[209][210] Military satellites photographed extensive Russian convoys of infantry and mechanised units deploying south from Kharkiv to Izium on 11 April, apparently part of the planned Russian redeployment of its north-eastern troops to the south-eastern front of the invasion.[211]
- On 18 April, with Mariupol almost entirely overtaken by Russian forces, the Ukrainian government announced that the second phase of the reinforced invasion of the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions had intensified with expanded invasion forces occupying of the Donbas.[212]
- On 22 May, the BBC reported that after the fall of Mariupol, Russia had intensified offensives in Luhansk and Donetsk while concentrating missile attacks and intense artillery fire on Sievierodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province.[213]
- On 23 May, Russian forces were reported entering the city of Lyman, fully capturing the city by 26 May.[214][215] Ukrainian forces were reported leaving Sviatohirsk.[216] By 24 May, Russian forces captured the city of Svitlodarsk.[217] On 30 May, Reuters reported that Russian troops had breached the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk.[218] By 2 June, The Washington Post reported that Sievierodonetsk was on the brink of capitulation to Russian occupation with over 80 per cent of the city in the hands of Russian troops.[219] On 3 June, Ukrainian forces reportedly began a counter-attack in Sievierodonetsk. By 4 June, Ukrainian government sources claimed 20% or more of the city had been recaptured.[220]
- On 12 June, it was reported that possibly as many as 800 Ukrainian civilians (as per Ukrainian estimates) and 300–400 soldiers (as per Russian sources) were besieged at the Azot chemical factory in Severodonetsk.[221][222] With the Ukrainian defences of Severodonetsk faltering, Russian invasion troops began intensifying their attack upon the neighbouring city of Lysychansk as their next target city in the invasion.[223] On 20 June it was reported that Russian troops continued to tighten their grip on Severodonetsk by capturing surrounding villages and hamlets surrounding the city, most recently the village of Metelkine.[224]
- On 24 June, CNN reported that, amid continuing scorched-earth tactics being applied by advancing Russian troops, Ukraine's armed forces were ordered to evacuate the Severodonetsk; several hundred civilians taking refuge in the Azot chemical plant were left behind in the withdrawal, with some comparing their plight to that of the civilians at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol in May.[225] On 3 July, CBS announced that the Russian defense ministry claimed that the city of Lysychansk had been captured and occupied by Russian forces.[226] On 4 July, The Guardian reported that after the fall of the Luhansk oblast, that Russian invasion troops would continue their invasion into the adjacent Donetsk Oblast to attack the cities of Sloviansk and Bakhmut.[227]
- On 14 April, Ukrainian troops reportedly blew up a bridge between Kharkiv and Izium used by Russian forces to redeploy troops to Izium, impeding the Russian convoy.[228]
- On 5 May, David Axe writing for Forbes stated that the Ukrainian army had concentrated its 4th and 17th Tank Brigades and the 95th Air Assault Brigade around Izium for possible rearguard action against the deployed Russian troops in the area; Axe added that the other major concentration of Ukraine's forces around Kharkiv included the 92nd and 93rd Mechanised Brigades which could similarly be deployed for rearguard action against Russian troops around Kharkiv or link up with Ukrainian troops contemporaneously being deployed around Izium.[229]
- On 13 May, BBC reported that Russian troops in Kharkiv were being retracted and redeployed to other fronts in Ukraine following the advances of Ukrainian troops into surrounding cities and Kharkiv itself, which included the destruction of strategic pontoon bridges built by Russian troops to cross over the Seversky Donets river and previously used for rapid tank deployment in the region.[230]
- Missile attacks and bombardment of the key cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa continued as the second phase of the invasion began.[183] On 22 April, Russia's Brigadier General Rustam Minnekayev in a defence ministry meeting said that Russia planned to extend its Mykolayiv–Odesa front after the siege of Mariupol further west to include the breakaway region of Transnistria on the Ukrainian border with Moldova.[231][232] The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine described this intention as imperialism, saying that it contradicted previous Russian claims that it did not have territorial ambitions in Ukraine and that the statement was an admission that "the goal of the 'second phase' of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine".[231] Georgi Gotev, writing for Reuters on 22 April, noted that occupying Ukraine from Odesa to Transnistria would transform it into a landlocked nation without any practical access to the Black Sea.[233] On 24 April, Russia resumed its missile strikes on Odesa, destroying military facilities and causing two dozen civilian casualties.[234]
- On 27 April, Ukrainian sources indicated that explosions had destroyed two Russian broadcast towers in Transnistria, primarily used to rebroadcast Russian television programming.[235] At the end of April, Russia renewed missile attacks on runways in Odesa, destroying some of them.[236] During the week of 10 May, Ukrainian troops began to take military action to dislodge Russian forces installing themselves on Snake Island in the Black Sea approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) from Odesa.[237] On 30 June 2022, Russia announced that it had withdrawn troops from the island after objectives were completed.[238][239]
- On 23 July, CNBC reported a Russian missile strike on Ukrainian port Odesa stating that the action was swiftly condemned by world leaders, a dramatic revelation amid a recently U.N. and Turkish-brokered deal that secured a sea corridor for grains and other foodstuff exports.[240][241] On 31 July, CNN reported significant intensification of the rocket attacks and bombing of Mykolaiv by Russians also killing Ukrainian grain tycoon Oleksiy Vadaturskyi in the city during the bombing.[242]
- Russian forces continued to fire missiles and drop bombs on the key cities of Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia.[183] On 10 April, Russian missiles destroyed the Dnipro International Airport.[243][244] On 2 May the UN reportedly evacuated about 100 survivors from the siege at Mariupol with the cooperation of Russian troops, to the village of Bezimenne near Donetsk, from whence they were to move to Zaporizhzhia.[245] On 28 June, Reuters reported that a Russian missile attack was launched upon the city of Kremenchuk north-west or Zaporizhzhia detonating in a public mall and causing at least 18 deaths while drawing condemnation from France's Emmanuel Macron, among other world leaders, who spoke of it as being a "war crime".[246]
- On 7 July, it was reported that after the Russians captured the nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia earlier in the invasion, they installed heavy artillery and mobile missile launchers between the separate reactor walls of the nuclear installation, using it as a shield against possible Ukrainian counterattack. A counterattack against the installed Russian artillery sites would not be possible without the risk of radiation fallout in case of near misses.[247] On 19 August, Russia agreed to allow IAEA inspectors access to the Zaporizhzhia plant from Ukrainian-held territory, after a phone call between Macron and Putin. A temporary ceasefire around the plant still needed to be agreed for the inspection.[248][249]
- Russia reported that 12 attacks with over 50 artillery shells explosions had been recorded at the plant and the staff town of Enerhodar, by 18 August.[250] Also on 19 August, Tobias Ellwood, chair of the UK's Defence Select Committee, said that any deliberate damage to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that could cause radiation leaks would be a breach of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, according to which an attack on a member state of NATO is an attack on all of them. The next day, United States congressman Adam Kinzinger said that any radiation leak would kill people in NATO countries, which would be an automatic activation of Article 5.[251][252]
- Shelling hit coal ash dumps at the neighbouring coal-fired power station on 23 August, and ash was on fire by 25 August. The 750 kV transmission line to the Dniprovska substation, which was the only one of the four 750 kV transmission lines that had not yet been damaged and cut by military action, passes over the ash dumps. At 12:12 p.m. on 25 August the line cut off due to the fire below, disconnecting the plant and its two operating reactors from the national grid for the first time since it started operating in 1985. In response, reactor 5's back-up generators and coolant pumps started up, and reactor 6 reduced generation.[253]
- Incoming power was still available via the 330 kV line to the substation at the coal-fired station, so the diesel generators were not essential for cooling reactor cores and spent fuel pools. The 750 kV line and reactor 6 resumed operation at 12:29 p.m., but the line was cut by fire again two hours later. The line, but not the reactors, resumed operation again later that day.[253] On 26 August, one reactor restarted in the afternoon and another in the evening, resuming electricity supplies to the grid.[254] On 29 August 2022, an IAEA team led by Rafael Grossi went to investigate the plant.[255] Lydie Evrard and Massimo Aparo were also in the leadership team. No leaks had been reported at the plant before their arrival but shelling had occurred days before.[256]
- On 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region,[257] beginning near Balakliia.[258] This counteroffensive was led by General Syrskyi.[259] By 12 September, an emboldened Kyiv launched a counteroffensive in the area surrounding Kharkiv with sufficient success for Russia to publicly admit to losing key positions in the area. The New York Times reported on 12 September that the success of the counteroffensive dented the image of a "Mighty Putin", and led to encouraging the government in Kyiv to seek more arms from the West to sustain its counteroffensive in Kharkiv and surrounding areas.[260][261] On 21 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation.[262][263] He also said that his country will use "all means" to "defend itself". Later that day, minister of defence Sergei Shoigu stated that 300,000 reservists would be called on a compulsory basis.[264][262] Mykhailo Podolyak, the adviser to the president of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said that the decision was predictable, and was an attempt to justify "Russia's failures".[265] British Foreign Office Minister Gillian Keegan called the situation an "escalation",[266] while former Mongolian president Tsakhia Elbegdorj accused Russia of using Russian Mongols as "cannon fodder".[267][268]
- On 8 October 2022, the Crimean Bridge partially collapsed due to an explosion.[269] Russia later blamed Ukraine for the blast, and launched retaliatory missile strikes against Ukrainian civilian areas.[270] Since mid-October, Russia has carried out waves of strikes on Ukrainian electrical and water systems.[271]
- In late September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine organised referendums on annexation of occupied territories of Ukraine, including the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in Russian occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, as well as the Russian-appointed military administrations of Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Denounced by Ukraine's government and its allies as sham elections, the official results showed overwhelming majorities in favor of annexation.[272]
- On 30 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in an address to both houses of the Russian parliament.[273][274] Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations all denounced the annexation as illegal.[275]
- On 3 September 2022, an IAEA delegation visited the nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia and on 6 September a report was published documenting damage and threats to the plant security caused by external shelling and the presence of occupying troops in the plant.[277][278] On 11 September, at 3:14 a.m., the sixth and final reactor was disconnected from the grid, "completely stopping" the plant. The statement from Energoatom said that "Preparations are underway for its cooling and transfer to a cold state".[279]
- In the early hours of 9 October 2022, the Russian Armed Forces carried out an airstrike on a residential building in the city of Zaporizhzhia, killing 13 civilians and injuring 89 others.[280][281][282][283][284]
- On 29 August, Zelenskyy advisedly vowed the start of a full-scale counteroffensive in the southeast. He first announced a counteroffensive to retake Russian-occupied territory in the south concentrating on the Kherson-Mykolaiv region, a claim that was corroborated by the Ukrainian parliament as well as Operational Command South.[285][286][287][288][289]
- On 4 September, Zelenskyy announced the liberation of two unnamed villages in Kherson Oblast and one in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities released a photo showing the raising of the Ukrainian flag in Vysokopillia by Ukrainian forces.[290][291] Ukrainian attacks also continued along the southern frontline, though reports about territorial changes were largely unverifiable.[292] On 12 September, Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces had retaken a total of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) from Russia, in both the south and the east. The BBC stated that it could not verify these claims.[293]
- In October, Ukrainian forces pushed further south towards the city of Kherson, taking control of 1,170 square kilometres (450 sq mi) of territory, with fighting extending to Dudchany.[294][295] On 9 November, defence minister Shoigu ordered Russian forces to leave part of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson, and move to the eastern bank of the Dnieper.[296] On 11 November, Ukrainian troops entered Kherson, as Russia completed its withdrawal. This meant that Russian forces no longer had a foothold on the west (right) bank of the Dnieper.[297]
- Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces launched another surprise counteroffensive on 6 September in the Kharkiv region,[257] beginning near Balakliia.[258] This counteroffensive was led by General Syrskyi.[259] By 7 September, Ukrainian forces had advanced some 20 kilometres (12 mi) into Russian occupied territory and claimed to have recaptured approximately 400 square kilometres (150 sq mi). Russian commentators said this was likely due to the relocation of Russian forces to Kherson in response to the Ukrainian offensive there.[298] On 8 September, Ukrainian forces captured Balakliia and advanced to within 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) of Kupiansk.[299] Military analysts said Ukrainian forces appeared to be moving towards Kupiansk, a major railway hub, with the aim of cutting off the Russian forces at Izium from the north.[300]
- On 9 September, the Russian occupation administration of Kharkiv Oblast announced it would "evacuate" the civilian populations of Izium, Kupiansk and Velykyi Burluk. The Institute for the Study of War said it believed Kupiansk would likely fall in the next 72 hours,[301] while Russian reserve units were sent to the area by both road and helicopter.[302] On the morning of 10 September, photos emerged claiming to depict Ukrainian troops raising the Ukrainian flag in the centre of Kupiansk,[303] and the Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had captured approximately 2,500 square kilometres (970 sq mi) by effectively exploiting their breakthrough.[304] Later in the day, Reuters reported that Russian positions in northeast Ukraine had "collapsed" in the face of the Ukrainian assault, with Russian forces forced to withdraw from their base at Izium after being cut off by the capture of Kupiansk.[305]
- By 15 September, an assessment by UK's Ministry of Defence confirmed that Russia had either lost or withdrawn from almost all of their positions west of the Oskil river. The retreating units had also abandoned various high-value military assets.[306] The offensive continued pushing east and by 2 October, Ukrainian Armed Forces had liberated another key city in the Second Battle of Lyman.[307]
- After the end of the twin Ukrainian counteroffensives, the fighting shifted to a semi-deadlock during the winter,[308] with heavy casualties but reduced motion of the frontline.[309] Russia launched a self-proclaimed winter offensive in eastern Ukraine, but the campaign ended in "disappointment" for Moscow, with the offensive stalling and gains being limited.[308][310] Analysts variously blamed the failure on Russia's lack of "trained men", and supply problems with artillery ammunition, among other problems.[308][310] Near the end of May, Mark Galeotti assessed that "after Russia’s abortive and ill-conceived winter offensive, which squandered its opportunity to consolidate its forces, Ukraine is in a relatively strong position".[311]
- On 7 February, The New York Times reported that Russians had newly mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers to participate in the offensive towards Nevske, against Ukraine troops already wearied by previous fighting.[312] The Russian private military company Wagner Group took on greater prominence in the war,[313] leading "grinding advances" in Bakhmut with tens of thousands of recruits from prison battalions taking part in "near suicidal" assaults on Ukrainian positions.[310]
- By 16 April 2023, The New York Times reported that documents in the 2023 Pentagon document leaks estimated 189,500 to 223,000 Russian casualties, compared to 124,500 to 131,000 Ukrainian casualties.[314] Ukraine's running tally of Russian fatalities reached 190,000 at roughly the same time; however, Ukraine's population is only about one-third of Russia's.[315][316]
- Following defeat in Kherson and Kharkiv, Russian and Wagner forces have focused on taking the city of Bakhmut and breaking the half year long stalemate that has prevailed there since the start of the war. Russian forces have sought to encircle the city, attacking from the north via Soledar and after taking heavy casualties during the battle Russian and Wagner forces took control of the settlement on 16 January 2023.[317][318] Attacking from the south, the Russian defence ministry and Wagner forces claimed to have captured Klishchiivka, a village located 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) southwest of Bakhmut in Donetsk on 20 January, however, this has yet to be independently verified.[319][320][321] This would mean that Bakhmut is facing attacks from north, south and east, with the sole line of supplies coming from the west via Chasiv Yar to fend off renewed Russian assaults.[322][323][324]
- By 22 February, Russian forces had enveloped Bakhmut, from the east, south, and north.[325] By 3 March, Ukrainian soldiers destroyed two key bridges, creating the possibility for a controlled fighting withdrawal.[326] On 4 March, Bakhmut's deputy mayor told news services that there was street fighting but that Russian forces had not taken control of the city.[327][328] Also on 4 March, the chief of the Wagner Group said that the city was encircled except for one road still controlled by the Ukrainian military, as had been the case since 22 February.[329]
- On 7 March, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian commanders were requesting permission from Kyiv to continue fighting against the Russians in the nearly fully surrounded and besieged city.[330] On 26 March, CNN reported that Wagner forces had claimed to have fully captured the tactically significant Azom factory in Bakhmut.[331] Appearing before the House Committee on Armed Services on 29 March, General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reported that, "for about the last 20, 21 days, the Russia have not made any progress whatsoever in and around Bakhmut". Milley described the severe casualties being inflicted upon the Russian forces there as a "slaughter-fest".[332] On 18 May 2023, The New York Times reported that Ukrainian forces launched a local counteroffensive, taking back swathes of territory to the north and south of Bakhmut over the course of a few days.[333][334]
- On 24 January 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported an intensification of fighting in the Zaporizhzhia region with both sides suffering heavy casualties.[335] An intense, three-week Russian assault near the coal-mining town of Vuhledar was called the largest tank battle of the war to date,[336] ended in disaster for Russian forces, with Ukrainian commanders and the British Ministry of Defense saying that Russia had lost "at least 130 tanks and armored personnel carriers" during the battle, and "a whole Russian brigade was effectively annihilated", respectively.[336][337]
- Increasing tension caused by diplomatic support by China of Russia's invasion was reported by The New York Times on 2 April 2023, with China viewing Russia's experience in Ukraine as possibly informing China's assessment of its contemporary tensions and diplomatic assessments concerning Taiwan.[338]
- The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of children, and genocide during the invasion.[339][340]
On 17 March 2023 the ICC issued a warrant for Putin's arrest,[341][342][343][344] alleging that Putin held criminal responsibility in the illegal deportation and transfer of children from Ukraine to Russia during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[345][346][347] It was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of one of the five Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council[341] (the world's five principal nuclear powers).[348]
- On 20 February, Biden visited Kyiv to assure Zelenskyy of sustaining US financial and military supplies support to Ukraine on the eve of the end of the first year of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[103]
- Continuing the infrastructure bombings that began after the Crimean Bridge explosions, on 15 November 2022, Russia fired 85 missiles at the Ukrainian power grid, causing major power outages in Kyiv and neighboring regions. A missile, initially reported to be Russian and later claimed to be "Russian-made", crossed into Poland, killing two people in Przewodów, which led to the top leaders of Poland holding an emergency meeting.[349] The next day, US president Joe Biden stated that the missile that struck Polish territory was 'unlikely' to have been fired from Russia.[350] On 31 December, Putin ordered an extensive and large missile and drone attack upon Kyiv accompanied by his declaration that he intends to increase the diplomatic and military ante of the war against Ukraine for all Russians to now be a "sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants".[351]
- On 10 March 2023, The New York Times reported that Russia has converted its massive missile attacks of Ukraine towards the preferred use of hypersonic missile systems, which are more effective in evading conventional Ukrainian anti-missile defenses which were proving useful against conventional, non-hypersonic Russian missile systems.[352]
- On 31 July 2022, Russian Navy Day commemorations were cancelled after a drone attack reportedly wounded several people at the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol.[353] On 9 August 2022, there were large explosions reported at Saky Air Base in western Crimea. Satellite imagery showed that at least eight aircraft were damaged or destroyed. The cause of the explosions is unknown, but may have been long-range missiles, sabotage by special forces or an accident;[354] Zaluzhnyi claimed on 7 September that it had been a Ukrainian missile attack.[355]
- The base is located near the town of Novofedorivka, which is popular with tourists. Queues to leave the area formed at the Crimean Bridge after the explosions.[356] A week later there were explosions and a fire at an arms depot near Dzhankoi in northeastern Crimea, which Russia blamed on "sabotage". A railway line and power station were also damaged. According to the Russian regional head, Sergei Aksyonov, 2,000 people were evacuated from the area.[357] On 18 August, explosions were reported at Belbek Air Base, north of Sevastopol.[358]
- On the morning of 8 October, the Kerch Bridge, which links occupied Crimea with Russia, was hit by a large explosion which collapsed part of the roadway and caused damage to the railway line.[359]
- Aerial warfare began on the first day of the invasion. By September, the Ukrainian air force was still at 80% of its prewar strength and had shot down about 55 Russian warplanes.[360][361] By late December, 173 Ukrainian aircraft and UAVs were confirmed to have been shot down, whereas Russia had lost 171 aircraft. With the beginning of the invasion, dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine.[70][71] Dozens of missile strikes across Ukraine also reached as far west as Lviv.[72][73] Starting in mid-October, Russian forces launched massive missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure, intending to knock out energy facilities throughout the country.[362] By late November, hundreds of civilians had been killed and wounded by the attacks,[363] and millions of civilians had been left without power due to rolling blackouts.[364]
- On 16 October, the Washington Post reported that Iran was planning to supply Russia with both drones and missiles.[365] On 21 November, the Ukrainian defense ministry said that according to reports in the Israeli press, Israel might respond by transferring short-range and medium-range missiles to Ukraine.[366] On 18 October 2022 the U.S. State Department accused Iran of violating UN Resolution 2231 by selling Shahed 131 and Shahed 136 drones to Russia,[367][368] agreeing with similar assessments by France and the United Kingdom. Iran denied sending arms for use in the Ukraine war.[369][370] On 22 October France, Britain and Germany formally called for an investigation by the UN team responsible for UNSCR 2231.[371] On 1 November, CNN reported that Iran was preparing to send ballistic missiles and other weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine.[372] On 21 November, CNN reported that an intelligence assessment had concluded that Iran planned to help Russia begin production of Iran-designed drones in Russia. The country making the intelligence assessment was not named.[373]
- By 29 December, the Biden administration stated through diplomatic entreaties that Iran would need to curtail its supply of drones to Russia being used in its invasion of Ukraine, under the alternative that the United States would be compelled to redouble its supply of anti-drone missile intercept technology to Ukraine in order to nullify Iranian drone weaponry currently being deployed against Ukraine.[374]
- In December, several attacks on Dyagilevo and Engels air bases in Western Russia were allegedly carried out by drones launched from Ukraine causing 10 casualties in addition to heavily damaging two Tu-95 aircraft.[375][376]
- Ukraine lies on the Black Sea, which has ocean access only through the Turkish-held Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. On 28 February, Turkey invoked the 1936 Montreux Convention and sealed off the straits to Russian warships not registered to Black Sea home bases and not returning to their ports of origin. This prevented the passage of four Russian naval vessels through the Turkish Straits in late February.[377][378][379] On 24 February, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine announced that an attack on Snake Island by Russian Navy ships had begun.[380] The guided missile cruiser Moskva and patrol boat Vasily Bykov bombarded the island with their deck guns.[381] When the Russian warship identified itself and instructed the Ukrainian soldiers stationed on the island to surrender, their response was "Russian warship, go fuck yourself!"[382][383] After the bombardment, a detachment of Russian soldiers landed and took control of Snake Island.[384]
- Russia stated on 26 February that US drones supplied intelligence to the Ukrainian navy to help target Russian warships in the Black Sea, which the US denied.[385] By 3 March, the Ukrainian frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, the flagship of the Ukrainian navy, was scuttled in Mykolaiv to prevent its capture by Russian forces.[386][387][388][389] On 14 March, the Russian source RT reported that the Russian Armed Forces had captured about a dozen Ukrainian ships in Berdiansk, including the Polnocny-class landing ship Yuri Olefirenko.[390] On 24 March, Ukrainian officials said that a Russian landing ship docked in Berdiansk – initially reported to be the Orsk and then its sister ship, the Saratov – was destroyed by a Ukrainian rocket attack.[391][126][139] In March 2022, the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) sought to create a safe sea corridor for commercial vessels to leave Ukrainian ports.[392] On 27 March, Russia established a sea corridor 80 miles (130 km) long and 3 miles (4.8 km) wide through its Maritime Exclusion Zone, for the transit of merchant vessels from the edge of Ukrainian territorial waters south-east of Odesa.[393][394] Ukraine closed its ports at MARSEC level 3, with sea mines laid in port approaches, until the end to hostilities.[395]
- The Russian cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, was, according to Ukrainian sources and a US senior official,[396] hit on 13 April by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, setting the ship on fire. The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the warship had suffered serious damage due to a munition explosion caused by a fire, and said that its entire crew had been evacuated.[397] Pentagon spokesman John Kirby reported on 14 April that satellite images showed that the Russian warship had suffered a sizeable explosion onboard but was heading to the east for expected repairs and refitting in Sevastopol.[398] Later on the same day, the Russian Ministry of Defence stated that Moskva had sunk while under tow in rough weather.[399] On 15 April, Reuters reported that Russia launched an apparent retaliatory missile strike against the missile factory Luch Design Bureau in Kyiv where the Neptune missiles used in the Moskva attack were manufactured and designed.[400] On 5 May, a US official confirmed that the US gave "a range of intelligence" (including real-time battlefield targeting intelligence)[401] to assist in the sinking of the Moskva.[402]
- In early May, Ukrainian forces launched counterattacks on Snake Island. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed to have repelled these counterattacks. Ukraine released footage of a Russian Serna-class landing craft located in the Black Sea being destroyed near Snake Island by a Ukrainian drone.[403][404] The same day, a pair of Ukrainian Su-27 conducted a high-speed, low level bombing run on Russian-occupied Snake Island; the attack was captured on film by a Baykar Bayraktar TB2 drone.[405] On 1 June, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asserted that Ukraine's policy of mining its own harbours to impede Russia maritime aggression had contributed to the food export crisis, stating that: "If Kyiv solves the problem of demining ports, the Russian Navy will ensure the unimpeded passage of ships with grain to the Mediterranean Sea."[406] On 30 June 2022, Russia announced that it had withdrawn troops from the island in a "gesture of goodwill".[238] The withdrawal was later officially confirmed by Ukraine.[407]
- The supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders.[408] Ukraine's top military commander responsible for defence in the war is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi.[409]  On Zaluzhnyi's leadership of the Ukrainian military, Milley has opined: "[He] has emerged as the military mind his country needed. His leadership enabled the Ukrainian armed forces to adapt quickly with battlefield initiative against the Russians."[410] Russia started its invasion with no overall commander, starting its so-called "special military operation" without expectation of serious resistance or a real war. Commanders of four military districts were each responsible for their own offensive campaign.[409]
- After initial setbacks, commander of the Russian Southern Military District Aleksandr Dvornikov was placed in overall command on April 8, 2022, while maintaining responsibility for his own campaign. Russian forces improved their focus on the protection of supply lines by advancing slowly and methodically. They also benefited from the centralised command under Dvornikov.[411] However, continued failures to achieve military objectives led to multiple changes in overall command, all while continuing to fulfill the responsibilities of other posts, with commander of the Eastern Military District Gennadii Zhidko (Eastern Military District, 26 May–8 Oct), commander of the southern grouping of forces Sergei Surovikin (8 Oct–11 Jan), and commander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces Valerii Gerasimov (from 11 Jan 2023) successively having the role added to their responsibilities.[409] Russian president Putin may have personally rotated leaders through the top position to avoid responsibility for failures and prevent any one commander from claiming victory (like the tensions between Stalin and Zhukov after WWII).[412]
- Russia has suffered a remarkably large number of casualties in the officer ranks, including quite a few generals.
- Four days into the invasion, President Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces on high alert, raising fears that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine, or a wider escalation of the conflict could occur. During April, Putin and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov made a number of threats alluding to the use of nuclear weapons against Ukraine and the countries supporting Ukraine.[413][414] On 14 April, CIA director William Burns said that "potential desperation" in the face of defeat could encourage President Putin to use tactical nuclear weapons.[415] In response to Russia's disregard of safety precautions during its occupation of the disabled former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl and its firing of missiles in the vicinity of the active Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, on 26 April President Zelenskyy called for an international discussion on regulating Russia's use of nuclear resources, stating: "no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has ... If Russia has forgotten what Chernobyl is, it means that global control over Russia's nuclear facilities, and nuclear technology is needed."[416] In August, shelling around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant developed into a crisis, prompting an emergency inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Ukraine has described the crisis as an act of nuclear terrorism by Russia.[417] On 19 September, CNBC reported that Biden's response to Russian uncertainties about its lack of combat success in its invasion stating: "President Joe Biden warned of a 'consequential' response from the U.S. if Russian President Vladimir Putin were to use nuclear or other non-conventional weapons... Asked what he would say to Putin if he was considering such action, Biden replied, 'Don't. Don't. Don't.'"[418] Following his statement made on 19 September, Biden appeared before the United Nations on 21 September and continued his criticism of Putin's nuclear sabre-rattling, stating that Putin was "overt, reckless and irresponsible... A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."[419] In January 2023, Graham Allison, writing for Time, presented a seven-point summary of Putin's hypothetical intention to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.[420] In March 2023, Putin announced plans to install Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.[421]
- Ukrainian civilians resisted the Russian invasion, volunteering for territorial defence units, making Molotov cocktails, donating food, building barriers such as Czech hedgehogs,[422] and helping to transport refugees.[423] Responding to a call from Ukraine's transportation agency, Ukravtodor, civilians dismantled or altered road signs, constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways. Social media reports showed spontaneous street protests against Russian forces in occupied settlements, often evolving into verbal altercations and physical standoffs with Russian troops.[424] By the beginning of April, Ukrainian civilians began to organise as guerrillas, mostly in the wooded north and east of the country. The Ukrainian military announced plans to launch a large-scale guerrilla campaign to complement its conventional defence against the Russian invasion.[425]
- People physically blocked Russian military vehicles, sometimes forcing them to retreat.[424][426][427] The Russian soldiers' response to unarmed civilian resistance varied from reluctance to engage the protesters[424] to firing into the air or directly into crowds.[428] There have been mass detentions of Ukrainian protesters, and Ukrainian media has reported forced disappearances, mock executions, hostage-taking, extrajudicial killings, and sexual violence perpetrated by the Russian military.[429] To facilitate Ukrainian attacks, civilians reported Russian military positions via a Telegram chatbot and Diia, a Ukrainian government app previously used by citizens to upload official identity and medical documents. In response, Russian forces began destroying mobile phone network equipment, searching door-to-door for smartphones and computers, and in at least one case killing a civilian found with pictures of Russian tanks.[430]
- As of 21 May 2022, Zelenskyy indicated that Ukraine had 700,000 servicemembers on active duty combating the Russian invasion.[431] Throughout 2022, Ukraine withdrew soldiers and military equipment deployed to United Nations peacekeeping missions, such as MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, back to Ukraine.[432]
- The invasion received widespread international condemnation from governments and intergovernmental organisations.[433] On 2 March 2022 and on 23 February 2023, 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted for Russia to immediately withdraw, while only five and seven member states, respectively, including Russia, voted against the resolutions.[434] Political reactions to the invasion included new sanctions imposed on Russia, which triggered widespread economic effects on the Russian and world economies.[435] The European Union and other Western governments financed and delivered humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The bloc also implemented various economic sanctions, including a ban on Russian aircraft using EU airspace,[436] a ban on certain Russian banks from using the SWIFT international payments system, and a ban on certain Russian media outlets.[437] Reactions to the invasion have varied considerably across a broad spectrum of concerns including public response, media responses, peace efforts, and the examination of the legal implications of the invasion.
- The invasion received widespread public condemnation internationally, while in some countries, certain sectors expressed sympathy or outright support for Russia due in part to distrust of US foreign policy.[438] Protests and demonstrations were held worldwide, including some in Russia and parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia.[439] Calls for a boycott of Russian goods spread on social media platforms,[440] while hackers attacked Russian websites, particularly those operated by the Russian government.[441] Anti-Russian sentiment against Russians living abroad surged after the invasion.[442][443]
- The invasion prompted Ukraine,[444] Finland and Sweden to officially apply for NATO membership.[445] By April 2023, Finland was accepted as a member of NATO.[446]
- Although Ukraine is not a member of NATO and does not have any military alliance with the United States or with any NATO nation,[19] the Kiel Institute has tracked $84.2 billion from the 40 countries and the European Union in financial, humanitarian, and military aid to Ukraine from 24 January to 3 August 2022.[449] NATO is coordinating and assisting member states in providing billions of dollars in military equipment and financial aid to Ukraine.[450] The United States has provided the most military assistance, having committed over $29.3 billion from 24 February 2022 to 3 February 2023.[451][e] Many NATO allies, including Germany, have reversed past policies against providing offensive military aid in order to support Ukraine. The European Union for the first time in its history supplied lethal arms and has provided €3.1 billion to Ukraine.[454] Bulgaria, a major manufacturer of Soviet-pattern weapons, has covertly supplied more than €2 billion worth of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, including a third of the ammunition needed by the Ukrainian military in the critical early phase of the invasion; Bulgaria also provides fuel supplies and has, at times, covered 40% of the fuel needs of the Ukrainian armed forces.[455]
- Foreign involvement in the invasion has been worldwide and extensive, with support ranging from foreign military sales and aid, foreign military involvement, foreign sanctions and ramifications, and including foreign condemnation and protest.[456][457] NATO and the EU have publicly taken a strict policy of "no boots on the ground" in Ukraine.[458] Western countries and others imposed limited sanctions on Russia when it recognised the separatist people's republics as independent nations. When the attack began, many other countries applied sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy.[459] The sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, bank transfers, exports, and imports.[456][457]
- Belarus has allowed its territory to be used by Russia to stage part of the invasion, as well as be used for launching Russian missiles into Ukraine.[460]
- On 17 March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian leader Vladimir Putin.[461]
- Combat deaths can be inferred from a variety of sources, including satellite photos and videos of military action.[462] Both Russian and Ukrainian sources are widely believed to inflate casualty numbers in opposing forces, while downplaying their own losses for the sake of morale. Russian news outlets have largely stopped reporting the Russian death toll.[463][464][465][466] Russia and Ukraine admitted suffering "significant" and "considerable" losses, respectively.[465][466] BBC News reported in April 2022 that Ukrainian claims of Russian deaths included the living injured.[467][468] Agence France-Presse and independent conflict monitors could not verify Russian and Ukrainian claims of enemy losses and suspected that they were inflated.[469]
- The number of civilian and military deaths is impossible to determine precisely in the fog of war.[470][462] On 12 October 2022, the independent Russian media project iStories reported that more than 90,000 Russian soldiers had been killed, been seriously wounded, or gone missing in Ukraine, citing sources close to the Kremlin.[471] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) estimates the number of civilian casualties to be considerably higher than the figure the United Nations has been able to certify.[472] On 16 June, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence told CNN that he believed that tens of thousands of Ukrainians had died, adding that he hoped that the true death toll was below 100,000.[473] In the destroyed city of Mariupol alone, Ukrainian officials believe at least 25,000 have been killed;[474] but investigations of morgue records indicate many more,[475] and some bodies remain uncollected.[476]
- Official statistics and estimates of prisoners of war (POW) have varied.[505] In the initial stages of the invasion, on 24 February, Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said that a platoon of the 74th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade from Kemerovo Oblast surrendered, saying they were unaware that they had been brought to Ukraine and tasked with killing Ukrainians.[506] Russia claimed to have captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers by 2 March 2022,[507] while Ukraine claimed 562 Russian soldiers were being held as prisoners as of 20 March,[508] with 10 previously reported released in a prisoner exchange for five Ukrainian soldiers and the mayor of Melitopol.[509][510]
- A report by The Independent on 9 June cited an intelligence report estimating that more than 5,600 Ukrainian soldiers had been captured, while the number of Russian servicemen being held as prisoners had fallen to 550, from 900 in April, following several prisoner exchanges. In contrast, Ukrayinska Pravda claimed 1,000 Russian soldiers were being held as prisoners as of 20 June.[511]
- The first large prisoner exchange took place on 24 March 2022, when 10 Russian and 10 Ukrainian soldiers, as well as 11 Russian and 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors, were exchanged.[512][513] On 1 April 86 Ukrainian servicemen were exchanged[514] for an unknown number of Russian troops.[515]
- On 25 August 2022, research conducted by the Humanitarian Research Lab of the Yale School of Public Health and the Conflict Observatory was published which reported the identification of some 21 filtration camps in and around Russian-controlled Donetsk oblast, run by Russian and Russian allied forces and used for Ukrainian "civilians, POWs, and other personnel". These camps were allegedly used for four main purposes: as registration points; as camps and other holding facilities for those awaiting registration; as interrogation centers; and as "correctional colonies" (i.e., prisons). At Olenivka prison, one of the identified camps, the disturbed earth seen in imagery was said by researchers to be consistent with graves. Kaveh Khoshnood, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said: "Incommunicado detention of civilians is more than a violation of international humanitarian law—it represents a threat to the public health of those currently in the custody of Russia and its proxies. The conditions of confinement documented in this report allegedly include insufficient sanitation, shortages of food and water, cramped conditions, and reported acts consistent with torture."[516]
- In March 2023, UN human rights commissioner Volker Türk reported that more than 90% of the Ukrainian POWs interviewed by his office, which could only include those who were released from Russia, said in Russia "they were tortured or ill-treated, notably in penitentiary facilities, including through so-called – it is an awful phrase – 'welcoming beatings' on their arrival, as well as frequent acts of torture throughout detention."[517]
- In April, several videos started circulating on different websites purportedly showing Russian soldiers beheading Ukrainian soldiers.[518]
- The humanitarian impact of the invasion has been extensive and has included negative impacts on international food supplies and the 2022 food crises.[519] The invasion has also had a negative impact upon the cultural heritage of Ukraine,[520] with over 500 Ukrainian cultural heritage sites, including cultural centers, theatres, museums, and churches, having been impacted by "Russian aggression", and Ukraine's Minister of Culture calling it cultural genocide.[521] The deliberate destruction and looting of Ukrainian cultural heritage sites in this way is considered a war crime.[522][523]
- The Russian attacks on civilians, causing mass civilian casualties and displacement, have been characterized as "genocide" and "democide".[524]
- The war caused the largest refugee and humanitarian crisis within Europe since the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s;[525][526] the UN described it as the fastest-growing such crisis since World War II.[527] As Russia built up military forces along the Ukrainian border, many neighbouring governments and aid organisations prepared for a mass displacement event in the weeks before the invasion. In December 2021, the Ukrainian defence minister estimated that an invasion could force three to five million people to flee their homes.[528]
- In the first week of the invasion, the UN reported over a million refugees had fled Ukraine; this subsequently rose to over eight million by 31 January 2023.[529][530] On 20 May, NPR reported that, following a significant influx of foreign military equipment into Ukraine, a significant number of refugees are seeking to return to regions of Ukraine which are relatively isolated from the invasion front in south-eastern Ukraine.[531] However, by 3 May, another 8 million people were displaced inside Ukraine.[532]
- Most refugees were women, children, the elderly, or people with disabilities.[533][534] Most male Ukrainian nationals aged 18 to 60 were denied exit from Ukraine as part of mandatory conscription,[535][536] unless they were responsible for the financial support of three or more children, single fathers, or were the parent/guardian of children with disabilities.[537] Many Ukrainian men, including teenagers, opted to remain in Ukraine voluntarily in order to join the resistance.[538][539]
- Regarding destinations, according to the UN High Commission for Refugees, as of 13 May, there were 3,315,711 refugees in Poland, 901,696 in Romania, 594,664 in Hungary, 461,742 in Moldova, 415,402 in Slovakia, and 27,308 in Belarus, while Russia reported it had received over 800,104 refugees.[540] As of 23 March, over 300,000 refugees had arrived in the Czech Republic.[541] Turkey has been another significant destination, registering more than 58,000 Ukrainian refugees as of 22 March, and more than 58,000 as of 25 April.[542][543] The EU invoked the Temporary Protection Directive for the first time in its history, granting Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years.[544] Britain has accepted 146,379 refugees, as well as extending the ability to remain in the UK for 3 years with broadly similar entitlements as the EU, three years residency and access to state welfare and services.[545]
- According to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Russia has engaged in "massive deportation" of over 1.3 million Ukrainian civilians, potentially constituting crimes against humanity.[546][547] The OSCE and Ukraine have accused Russia of forcibly moving civilians to filtration camps in Russian-held territory, and then into Russia. Ukrainian sources have compared this policy to Soviet-era population transfers and Russian actions in the Chechen War of Independence.[548][549] For instance, as of 8 April, Russia claimed to have evacuated about 121,000 Mariupol residents to Russia.[549] Also, on 19 October, Russia announced the forced deportation of 60,000 civilians from areas around the line of contact in Kherson oblast.[550] RIA Novosti and Ukrainian officials said that thousands were dispatched to various centers in cities in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine,[551] from which people were sent to economically depressed regions of Russia.[552] In April, Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council secretary Oleksiy Danilov said Russia planned to build "concentration camps" for Ukrainians in western Siberia, and that it likely planned to force prisoners to build new cities in Siberia.[553][554][j]
- Based on a preliminary assessment the war has inflicted $51 billion in environmental damage in both territories. According to a report by the Yale School of the Environment, some 687,000 tons of petrochemicals have burned as a result of shelling, while nearly 1,600 tons of pollutants have leaked into bodies of water. Hazardous chemicals have contaminated around 70 acres of soil, and likely made agricultural activities temporarily impossible.[556]
- According to Netherlands-based peace organization PAX, Russia's "deliberate targeting of industrial and energy infrastructure" has caused "severe" pollution, and the use of explosive weapons has left "millions of tonnes" of contaminated debris in cities and towns.[557]
- Peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place on 28 February,[559] 3 March,[560] and 7 March 2022,[561] in an undisclosed location in the Gomel Region on the Belarus–Ukraine border,[562] with further talks held on 10 March in Turkey prior to a fourth round of negotiations which began on 14 March. The Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba stated on 13 July that peace talks are frozen for the time being.[563] On 19 July, former Russian President and current Deputy head of the Russian Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said: "Russia will achieve all its goals. There will be peace – on our terms."[564]
- Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that any peace plan can only proceed from Ukraine's recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the regions it annexed from Ukraine in September 2022.[565][566] By 29 December, following the Russian declared annexation of multiple Ukrainian oblasts, hopes for Ukrainian peace talks with Russia dimmed significantly with Russia taking a hardline position that the full Russian occupation of the four oblasts would be non-negotiable under any circumstances.[567] In addition, Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine would not hold peace talks with Russia while Putin was president and signed a decree to ban such talks.[568][569] In January 2023, Putin's spokesperson Peskov said that "there is currently no prospect for diplomatic means of settling the situation around Ukraine."[570]

- 
- The Bayraktar TB2 is a medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) capable of remotely controlled or autonomous flight operations. It is manufactured by the Turkish company Baykar Makina Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş., primarily for the Turkish Armed Forces.[3] The aircraft are monitored and controlled by an aircrew in a ground control station, including weapons employment. The development of the UAV has been largely credited to Selçuk Bayraktar, a former MIT graduate student.[4]
- By November 2021, the TB2 drone had completed 400,000 flight-hours globally.[5][2] The largest operator of TB2 drones is the Turkish military, but an export model has been sold to the militaries of a number of other countries.[6][7] Turkey has used the drone extensively in strikes on Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) targets in Iraq and Syria.[8][9][10][11] Bayraktar drones were later deployed by a number of other nations around the world in various wars, such as by Azerbaijan in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine,[12][13] as well as by the Ethiopian National Defense Force during the Tigray War.[14][15][16]
- The development of the Bayraktar TB2 had been spurred by a U.S. ban on exports of armed unmanned aircraft to Turkey due to concerns they would be used against PKK groups inside and outside Turkey.[11]
- Baykar started developing a new combat tactical aerial vehicle system at the request of the Presidency of Defense Industries, after the experiences of its first tactical UAV, the Bayraktar Çaldıran or Bayraktar TB1, delivered to the Turkish army in 2011.[17] The Bayraktar TB2 made its maiden flight in August 2014.[18] On 18 December 2015, a video was published of a test firing of a missile from the Bayraktar TB2, a result of a collaboration with Roketsan. Roketsan's MAM and TUBITAK-SAGE's BOZOK laser-guided bombs were tested for the first time.[19][20][21][22][excessive citations]
- The aircraft previously relied on imported and regulated components and technologies such as Rotax 912 engines[23] (manufactured in Austria) and optoelectronics (FLIR sensors imported from Wescam in Canada or Hensoldt from Germany). Bombardier Recreational Products, owner of Rotax, suspended delivery of their engines to certain countries in October 2020, after becoming aware of their military use despite being certified for civil use only.[23][24]
- According to British newspaper The Guardian, the arming of the Bayraktar TB2 would not have been possible without the help of the UK Hornet micro-munitions bomb rack by EDO MBM Technology Ltd. The bomb rack was provided to Turkey in 2015, and a variant of it was integrated into the aircraft by EDO MBM and Roketsan.[25] In response to The Guardian newspaper article, Baykar Chief Technical Officer Selçuk Bayraktar denied that the bomb rack came from the UK. "We are not buying it from you, we never did. It not only does not work under any circumstances but is also very expensive", Bayraktar said on Twitter. "We have designed and manufactured a more advanced and cost-effective one ourselves."[26]
- On 19 August 2020 the UK Department for International Trade (DIT) disclosed details of a six-year history of exports of the Hornet bomb rack to Turkey between 2014 and 2020, suggesting that supply of the critical technology to Turkey had continued well beyond the development stage of the Bayraktar TB2 and right up to the publication of the Guardian story in November 2019. 18 Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL) applications were submitted by EDO MBM Technology between 2014 and 2020 for exports of goods 'related to Hornet Bomb Racks / Hornet Missile Launchers' for end-users in Turkey. Of these; 16 of the licences were granted.[27]
- In October 2020 the use of the Canadian Wescam MX-15D system in the drone was disclosed after Armenian officials claimed that remains of a MX-15D system had been recovered from a downed TB2 drone during the nation's conflict with Azerbaijan. That triggered the stopping of MX-15D exports to Turkey while an investigation by Global Affairs Canada evaluates the use of Canadian technology in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.[28][29][30] Turkish industry responded to foreign sales boycotts by announcing provision of domestically manufactured alternatives including TEI PD170 engine (manufactured by TEI),[31][32] fuel valves and the CATS FLIR system (manufactured by Aselsan).[33] Integration tests with that system started on 6 November 2020.[34] Turkish defense industry researcher Kadir Doğan tweeted that cancellation of sales of components to Baykar by foreign companies did not pose a major problem, and that as of January 2021, all of those components have been replaced by locally manufactured alternatives.[35]
- However, the majority of Baykar's customers, including Ukraine, Poland, Morocco, and Kuwait, declined to purchase the Aselsan CATS electro-optical turret and opted to order the Wescam MX-15D through an authorized distributor.[36] Reasons include a weight increase from 45 to 61 kg (99 to 134 lb), general performance, and compatibility with existing fleet.[36]
- The Bayraktar TB2 platform has a blended wing body design with an inverted V-tail structure. Thrust is generated by a variable pitch two-blade propeller in pusher configuration. The propeller is mounted between the tail booms and driven by an internal combustion engine located in the body. The monocoque platform is modular with detachable main items such as wing, tail boom, and V-tails. Fuselage pieces are made mostly of carbon fiber composite with machined aluminum parts at joints. Fuel is stored within bladder tanks and fuel consumption is balanced with solenoid valves.
- The ground control station (GCS) is based on a NATO spec shelter unit which is equipped with cross redundant command and control systems. The mobile unit supports three personnel: pilot, payload operator and mission commander. The GCS is equipped with redundant air conditioners and nuclear, biological and chemical filtration (NBC) filtering unit. All hardware inside the shelter is placed inside racked cabinets. Each operator has dual screens in front along with the operator interface software used for real-time command, control and monitoring.[37]
- While the Turkish Armed Forces describes Bayraktar TB2 as "Tactical UAV Class" to prevent it from being a competitor to the TAI Anka UAV, international standards would classify it as a medium-altitude long-endurance UAV.[38][39]
- Each TB2 is configured with six aerial vehicle platforms,[clarification needed] two ground control stations, three ground data terminals (GDT), two remote video terminals (RVT) and ground support equipment.[citation needed] Each aerial platform is equipped with a triply redundant avionics system. Its ground control system's cross redundant architecture allows for pilot, payload operator and mission commander to command, control and monitor the platform.[40]
- The TB2 has a triple-redundant flight control system with autonomous taxi, takeoff, cruise, landing and parking capability. The computerized flight control system is the primary component, conducting sensor fusion algorithms with the real-time sensor data. Mission-specific controls are handled through the mission control computer system. The aerial platform is guided through various redundant rotary and linear servo actuators. All of the main airborne avionics equipment, software and hardware are under constant development.[41]
- The electronic power supply that powers the onboard systems is supported with triple alternators and balanced, smart lithium-ion battery units. A ruggedized heated camera unit is placed in the tail section of the platform to monitor flight and all payload and telemetry data are recorded to the airborne data recorder. The redundancy architecture of the avionics supports autonomous emergency landings on different airfields if necessary. Sensor fusion algorithms, including an inertial navigation system, allow navigation and auto landing even with loss of global positioning signals.[41]
- The price for a single TB2 unit has been estimated at 5 million US dollars, around one-sixth of the US-built Reaper UAV.[42] Baykar has not stated a price, but has republished on its website several news reports about crowdfunding campaigns launched in 2022 in Europe to buy Bayraktar UAVs for Ukraine, all of them fixing a goal of around US$5–5.5 million for the unit.[43][44]
- The Turkish military's use of the TB2 gained prominence in counterinsurgency operations against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) militants positions across the border in Iraq and Syria.[8][9][10][11]
- On 30 June 2018, one Turkish Air Force Bayraktar TB2 crashed due to technical problems in Hatay province, Turkey.[45][46]
- On 15 August 2018, Turkish Land Forces successfully used Bayraktar TB2 in a joint cross-border operation of the Turkish Armed Forces and the National Intelligence Organization of Turkey to kill the senior (PKK) leader and board member of the Kurdistan Communities Union İsmail Özden in Sinjar District, northwestern Iraq.[47]
- Turkish military used combined UAV and artillery tactics in Syria against the PKK-linked YPG. According to Turkey the number of militant killed or wounded rose to 449 by use of armed TB2 and 680 were indirectly in operations assisted by air support from the UAV.[8]
- On 16 May 2021, one Bayraktar TB2 crashed in Zebari, Northern Iraq, Kurdish militants claimed they shot down the drone.[48]
- A total of 37 Turkish Bayraktar TB2 UAVs successfully flew over 1551 hours in the earthquake zone of the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake.The drones have been instrumental in providing continuous updates and data to the crisis response team for damage detection, search and rescue support, along with coordination activities.[49]
- In June 2019, international news media reported that Libya's UN-recognized[50] Government of National Accord (GNA) used Bayraktar TB2s to strike an airbase held by General Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). Despite the UN embargo on Libya's ongoing civil war, it is suspected that at least 3 Bayraktar TB2 UCAV were being used over Tripoli by the GNA government forces. On 6 June 2019, two GNA TB2 drones are destroyed along an operation room by LNA attacks on Mitiga Airport.[51][52] Video evidence showed at least one TB2 flying over Tripoli[53] about to land at Mitiga's Military section, under control of GNA-allied forces.
- In March 2020 Bayraktar TB2s, Anka-S UAVs, and an array of Koral electronic jammers were deployed and extensively used in coordinated action to strike Syrian Army targets on the ground during the Operation Spring Shield launched by Turkey following losses the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the Russian forces in northwestern Syria at the end of February 2020.[82][83][84] The deployment was assessed by experts to be a success and a tactical game-changer.[85][86][87]
- During the week of fighting, Turkish drones took out 73 Syrian armed vehicles.[88] Russian sources said that the Russian-backed Syrian air defences claimed the destruction of seven Bayraktar TB2 UAVs by 5 March 2020.[89] However, there is only visual evidence for three Bayraktar drones being shot down.[90][91][92][93]
- On 23 August 2020, another Bayraktar TB2 drone was shot down by Syrian Air Defenses near Kafr Nabl, Idlib after being detected spotting targets for Syrian rebels.[94][95]
- On 22 October 2021, Turkey launched a surprise attack using Bayraktar TB2s on the Syrian town of Ayn al-Arab, destroying several vehicles and killing a passenger of a car, a suspected member of a Kurdish rebel group.[96]
- In 2022, Turkish drone strikes killed 50 fighters and 10 civilians.[97]
- In June 2020, the Defence Minister of Azerbaijan, Zakir Hasanov, announced that Azerbaijan had decided to purchase Bayraktar drones from Turkey.[98] During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Bayraktar TB2s were used against Armed Forces of Armenia with great success.[99] Azerbaijan used TB2s to destroy Armenian artillery, infantry positions and military vehicles, including BM-30 Smerch MLRS, T-72 tanks, BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFVs.[100][101] Nine Osa and Strela-10 air defense systems were also destroyed by Azerbaijani drones, likely TB2s.[100]
On 19 October 2020, a Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by air defenses of the Armenian Army over Nagorno-Karabakh.[102][103] On 8 November 2020, another Azerbaijani Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by air defense, in southeastern Nagorno-Karabakh.[104]
- As a part of its military modernization program the Armed Forces of Ukraine purchased 12 Bayraktar TB2s in 2019.[105][106] In January 2019, Baykar signed an agreement with Ukrspetsproject, part of Ukroboronprom, on the purchase of six TB2 and 3 ground control stations worth US$69 million for the Ukrainian army.[107][108] Ukraine received the first batch of the UAVs in March 2019.[109] After successful testing of the aircraft, the Ukrainian Navy placed a separate order for six TB2s, to be delivered in 2021, according to navy officials.[110] Meanwhile, Turkish and Ukrainian officials announced the establishment of a joint venture to produce 48 additional Bayraktar TB2s in Ukraine.[111] The first batch of the Bayraktar TB2 complex was delivered to the Navy in July 2021.[112]
- During a Russian military buildup in Crimea and near Ukraine's borders, a TB2 conducted a reconnaissance flight over the Donbas region on 9 April 2021. This was the first operational use of the aircraft by Ukrainian forces within an active conflict zone.[113][114] In October 2021, a TB2 drone was used for the first time in combat during the war, targeting a Russian separatist artillery position, destroying a D-30 howitzer, and halting the bombardment of Ukrainian troops near Hranitne.[115]
- During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, TB2 drones have been used by Ukraine's armed forces against Russian forces and equipment.[116] In January prior to the invasion, the spokesperson for the air force command Lt. Col. Yuri Ihnat confirmed that "Ukraine has approximately 20 Bayraktar drones, but we will not stop there".[117] On 2 March, Ukrainian defense minister Oleksii Reznikov announced the arrival of additional TB2 drones.[118]
- According to video footage released by the armed forces, TB2 drones have successfully destroyed on different occasions a Russian command post, military vehicles including tanks, IFVs, different types of trucks, surface-to-air missile systems (including Buk and Tor), self-propelled artillery, multiple rocket launcher (MLRS), howitzers and an electronic warfare system.[116][119][120][121][122] The drone also reportedly destroyed two Russian fuel trains, patrol boats and helicopter.[123][124][125]
- On 24 February, the day of invasion, four Bayraktar TB2 drones stationed at Chuhuiv Air base were abandoned and later destroyed in the ground by Ukrainian Forces, amid reported Russian rocket attacks.[126] People's Militia of the Luhansk People's Republic claimed it shot down two TB2 drones near the city of Luhansk.[127] On 27 February, Ukraine's air force confirmed two strikes by TB2 on Russian convoys in the Kherson and Zhytomyr regions.[119]
- The chief of Ukraine's air force Lieutenant General Mykola Oleschuk called the UAV system "life-giving".[128] The popularity of the drone in Ukraine led to a song, "Bayraktar" being written about the drone while throwing insults at the Russian army and the invasion.[129][130][131]
- Ukrainian drones appear to be equipped with anti-jamming antenna. They appear to use MAM-C glide bombs and  MAM-L. Traditional search radars appear to struggle against the TB2 because of its slow speed and size, which give it a low radar cross section. One radar that was destroyed on 7 May appeared to be actively scanning just prior to being supposedly hit. Although this may be helped by reports of Russian units turning off their own radars to reduce their own detection. It also can be deployed within minutes and launched from a normal road.[132]
- On 26 February 2022, two TB2 drones were claimed shot down near Schastia.[133] On 17 March 2022, a Bayraktar TB2 was shot down over Kyiv; Russia published images of the drone wreckage.[134] A second TB2 drone was shot down on 29 March 2022, in eastern Ukraine[135][136] On 2 April a third TB-2 drone was shot down.[137][138]
- On 12 April 2022, one Bayraktar TB2 was claimed to be shot down by Russian frigate Admiral Essen off the coast of Crimea.[139][140]
- On 13 April 2022, Ukrainian sources claimed at least two R-360 Neptune missiles were responsible for the sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva – causing an explosion on one of the ship's exposed deckside missile tubes. Drones, likely TB2s, were alleged to have helped decoy the cruiser's defences.[141][142]
- On 26 and 27 April, three additional TB2 drones were destroyed, two in Kursk Oblast[143][144] and the third in Belgorod Oblast, Russia by a Pantsir-S1.[145][146]
- On 1 May, a TB2 drone with registration S51T was shot down in Kursk region, Russia.[147] TB2 losses amounted to seven units confirmed visually.[124]
- On 2 May, Bayraktar drones operated by Ukraine attacked and destroyed two Russian Raptor-class patrol boats near Snake Island.[124]
- On 7 May, a TB2 drone attacked and destroyed a Russian Mil Mi-8 transport helicopter as it was unloading passengers on Snake Island.[125] In the same deployment, a TB2 drone destroyed a Tor missile launcher on the island, while a second launcher was destroyed as it was being unloaded from a landing craft. This cleared the way for a bombing run by Ukrainian Air Force Sukhoi Su-27 'Flanker' aircraft against buildings on the island.[122]
- On 23 May 2022, the remains of a Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2, tail number 75 were found in Romanian territorial waters by Romanian authorities. The drone was likely shot down during the Snake Island attacks made by Ukraine in May 2022.[148][149]
- On 28 May 2022 Lithuanian citizens fundraised $3.2 million, out of the $5.37 million, to buy a single Bayraktar TB2 drone for Ukraine.[150] On 2 June, Baykar said: "The people of Lithuania have honorably raised funds to buy a Bayraktar TB2 for Ukraine. Upon learning this, Baykar will gift a Bayraktar TB2 to Lithuania free of charge and asks those funds go to Ukraine for humanitarian aid."[151]
- From the beginning of the invasion to late June, Ukraine received over 50 TB2s. On 28 June, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced that Baykar would be devoting all of its capacities to meet the needs of the Ukrainian armed forces, fulfilling its requirement for "dozens more" of the aircraft.[152]
- In July 2022 Haluk Bayraktar, CEO of Baykar, stated in an interview that his company would never supply Russia with its drones as he supports Ukraine's sovereignty and independence.[153]
- On 5 May 2023, the Ukrainian air force said it downed one of its own TB2 drone over Kyiv, after they lost control of it due to a "likely" technical malfunction. No casualties were reported from the incident.[154]
- Although at the start of the invasion Ukrainian drones, including the TB2, were able to be used to harass Russian forces, by summer 2022 they had become less effective in this role. The disorganized Russians were initially slow to set up proper air defenses, but once they did Ukrainian UAVs were downed with increasing frequency. In addition to being shot down, electronic warfare is used to jam and disrupt communication links. This may have caused the Ukrainians to scale back TB2 use.[155] On 25 July, a military expert said to the BBC, that the slow speed and medium altitudes of Bayraktar drones made them easy targets for Russian air defenses, and that many were shot down.[156]
- By late July a TB2 with tail number U139 was reported shot down in Belgorod Oblast, Russia.[157] On 2 August another drone with call sign 409 was shot down in Ukraine.[158] On 2 September 2022, the remains of a Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 drone were discovered in Kherson.[159]
- By July 2022, Bayraktar TB2 losses reached 14 units, confirmed visually.[160]
- The commander of the Russian Air Defense Force Lieutenant General Andrey Demin claimed in April 2023 that Russia had shoot down "more than 100" Bayraktar drones since the war began.[161]
- Ethiopian forces have reportedly been using the TB2 against the TPLF in the Tigray War. Satellite images have shown TB2 drones in Harar Meda airbase, and debris of MAM-L guided munition have been found in Tigray.[162][163][164] On 7 January 2022, a drone strike killed nearly 60 civilians and injured dozens more in a camp of internally displaced people in Dedebit in Tigray; the missile used was a MAM-L exclusively used with the TB2 drone.[165]
- Some parts of Africa face attacks by highly mobile bands of Islamist militants, moving through scrubby terrain by motorbike to attack isolated military and civilian targets. This had largely been in the Sahel, but by 2019 had been spreading. Drones provide countries with aerial surveillance capacity to seek and potentially attack insurgents. Buying from Turkey reduces the dependence of Niger and Togo on former colonial power France.[166]
- In October 2020, Baykar CTO Selçuk Bayraktar showed the new, improved version of TB2, named TB2S. In Selçuk Bayraktar's Twitter post, the TB2S has a protrusion on its body and an antenna on its nose for satellite communication (SATCOM).[167][168] In the basic model of TB2, communication between the aircraft and the control station was via ground-based antenna. Communication via the TÜRKSAT satellite provides a much bigger control range than the 150–300 km range of the basic model. The satellite communication will also make the TB2S more resistant to the jamming of communication by the enemy.[169] The SATCOM-integrated TB2S made its maiden flight on 4 December 2020.[170]

- The Bayraktar UAV or Bayraktar UCAV is a family of unmanned aerial vehicles designed and manufactured by Turkish company Baykar.[2] The UAVs were developed for the Turkish Armed Forces from 2004 until the present. Some models are designed for surveillance and reconnaissance only, others are capable of tactical ground-strike missions. Baykar is also developing drones to counter other aerial systems.[3] The word bayraktar means flag-bearer in Turkish.
- Bayraktar Mini UAV is a miniature UAV and the first UAV produced by Turkish company Baykar.[4][5]
- With the concept of short range day and night aerial reconnaissance and surveillance applications, system design activities started in 2004. An initial prototype Bayraktar Mini A was developed in 2005, and following successful autonomous flight demonstrations, Baykar was awarded a contract to start series production by the Turkish Armed Forces. The first batch was composed of 19 aircraft and they were mainly deployed to the southeast parts of Turkey for use in counterterrorism operations.[6]
- After hundreds of hours of flight trials, the system was subjected to major modifications and improved versions were developed. As a result, Bayraktar Mini B was fielded and became operational in December 2007 to be initially operated by the Turkish Armed Forces.[7][8] Due to its success in the region, the system was also exported to the Qatar Armed Forces in 2012.[9][10] The development of the aircraft is being continued and the most recent version (Bayraktar MINI D) has twice the communication range and 3 times higher maximum altitude of its predecessors.[11][12]
- Bayraktar TB1 (or Bayraktar Çaldıran) is the prototype UAV made for the Tactical UAV program of the Undersecretariat for Defence Industries (Savunma Sanayii Mustesarligi or SSM; now the Presidency of Defense Industries) of Turkey,[13] started in 2007. SSM invited two companies to compete for a prototype demonstration phase of the Tactical UAS Program. In 2009, Kale-Baykar, a joint venture between the Kale Group and Baykar Technologies, demonstrated Block A (named Bayraktar Çaldıran)[14] with its dual redundant avionics system and fully autonomous takeoff and landing capability. The aircraft was selected as the winner of the program.[15][16][17] While the contract was signed with the Presidency of Defense Industries for Bayraktar TB1s, these products were not delivered and remained as prototypes for Bayraktar Block 2s. Instead, serial production commenced with Bayraktar TB2.[18]
- Bayraktar TB2 is the serial production aircraft of the first tactical UAV of Baykar, Bayraktar TB1.
- Baykar started to develop a new combat tactical aerial vehicle system on request of Presidency of Defense Industries, after the experiences of its first tactical UAV Bayraktar Çaldıran (TB1) flown in 2011.[19] The Bayraktar TB2 conducted its maiden flight in August 2014. On 18 December 2015, a video was published for the missile test of Bayraktar TB2 in collaboration with ROKETSAN, testing Roketsan's MAM (Smart Micro Munition)s and TUBITAK-SAGE BOZOK laser-guided bombs for the first time.[20][21][22][23][24]
- The Turkish Armed Forces describe Bayraktar as a "Tactical UAV Class" to avoid competition with the TAI Anka UAV, but international standards would classify it as a medium-altitude long-endurance UAV.[25][26]
- Bayraktar Akıncı is the first High-altitude Long Endurance (HALE) class unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) of Baykar.
- The aircraft has a 5.5+ ton maximum takeoff weight (MTOW), with 1350+ kg of this composed of payload. Akıncı is equipped with two turboprop engines which have two different thrust capabilities: 450 or 750 hp. Akinci is equipped with electronic support and countermeasure systems, dual satellite communication systems, air-to-air radar, collision avoidance radar and national advanced synthetic aperture radar.[27]
- The Bayraktar TB3 is a variant of the TB2 that is capable of landing on a ship deck. In February 2021, chairman of the Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB) Ismail Demir made public a new type of UAV being developed by Baykar that is planned to be stationed to Turkey's first amphibious assault ship, TCG Anadolu.[28] The new aircraft being developed is a naval version of the Bayraktar TB2, powered by an engine developed by Turkish company Tusaş Engine Industries (TEI).[29][30] Demir said that between 30 and 50 folding-winged Bayraktar TB3 UAVs will be able to take off from and land on the deck of Anadolu.[31][32] Baykar's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Selçuk Bayraktar said in 2021 that the initial flight of the Bayraktar TB3 was scheduled for 2022.[33]
- Bayraktar Kızılelma (Bayraktar Red Apple) is a proposed supersonic[34] jet-powered single-engined stealth[35] carrier-capable[36] unmanned combat aircraft in development in 2021, planned to fly for the first time in 2023.[37][36]
- According to data shared by the company, Bayraktar Kızılelma will have an operational altitude of 35,000 feet (11,000 metres), a take-off weight of 5.5 tons, a payload of 1.5 tons, and an ammunition carrying capacity of 1 ton.
- Turkish military use TB-2 gained prominence in counterinsurgency operations against Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) positions across the border in Iraq and Syria.[38][39][40] Turkey considers PKK and YPG to be terrorist organizations.[41]
- In June 2019, international news media reported that the Libyan, UN recognized,[42] Government of National Accord (GNA) used Bayraktar TB2s to strike an airbase held by General Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). Despite the UN embargo on Libya's ongoing civil war, it is suspected that at least three Bayraktar TB2 UCAV were being used over Tripoli by the GNA government forces. On 6 June 2019, two GNA Bayraktar TB2 drones were destroyed along with an operation room by LNA attacks on Mitiga Airport.[43][44] Video evidence shows at least one Bayraktar TB2 flying over Tripoli[45] about to land at Mitiga's Military section, under control of GNA-allied forces.
- In March 2020 Bayraktar TB2s, Anka-S UAVs and an array of Koral electronic jammers were deployed and extensively used in coordinated action to strike Syrian Army targets on the ground during the Operation Spring Shield launched by Turkey following losses the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the Russian forces in northwestern Syria at the end February 2020.[46][47][48] The deployment was assessed by experts to be a success and a tactical game changer.[49][50][51]
- In June 2020 the Defence Minister of Azerbaijan, Zakir Hasanov, announced that Azerbaijan had decided to purchase Bayraktar drones from Turkey.[52] During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Bayraktar TB2s were used against Armed Forces of Armenia with great success.[53] Azerbaijan used TB-2s to destroy Armenian artillery, infantry positions and military vehicles including BM-30 Smerch MLRS, T-72s tanks, BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFVs.[54][55] Several Osa, Strela-10 and 5 S-300 air defense systems were also destroyed by TB2s.[54][56][57][58]
- As a part of its military modernization program, the Armed Forces of Ukraine acquired 12 Bayraktar TB2s in 2019.[59][60] After successful use of the aircraft, the Ukrainian Navy ordered 5 additional Bayraktar TB2s, reportedly delivered in 2020.[61] Meanwhile, Turkish and Ukrainian officials announced the establishment of a joint venture to produce 48 additional Bayraktar TB2s in Ukraine.[62]
- Ukraine's Bayraktar TB2s were used extensively during the 2022 Russian invasion[63] for surveillance of and attacks on Russian ground convoys.[64][65] The drones played a significant role in deterring Russian advances in the early stages of the conflict.[66]
- Ukrainian Chief of General Staff Valery Zaluzhny made available Bayraktar TB2 operation photographs on his Facebook account, including destruction of a Russian-made Buk Air Defense Missile System.[67]
- It has been reported that Baykar has exported its drones to at least 30 countries.[68] Only 16 of these user countries are publicly known, while the others countries are unknown:[69][70]

- Turkey’s Bayraktar TB2 combat drones have become famous in recent years, appearing to play decisive roles in various conflicts. But many experts questioned how effective the Bayraktars would truly be against a serious military power.
- Russia's invasion of Ukraine appears to have given them the opportunity to test that theory out.
- Footage released by the Ukrainian military over the weekend indicated that TB2s were operating against Moscow's forces, destroying long Russian military columns in Kherson, near Kyiv. Dozens of lives and equipment were reportedly lost in the Bayraktar strikes.
- TB2s have a proven track record of success against several adversaries in conflicts in Libya, Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh, yet they have never faced an army with sophisticated electronic warfare capabilities and state-of-the-art air defence systems.
- Before Russia attacked, Turkish officials believed the drones could be effective against the Russian military. They pointed to the TB2s' record of destroying various Russian-made weapons in Syria, Nagorno-Karabakh and Libya - in particular, the Pantsir air defence system, which has become a subject of mockery due to its failure to take down the Turkish drones.
- Ukraine and Turkey have close defence industry cooperation, a relationship that has flourished in recent years. The TB2's producer Baykar, which has close ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s family, was building a plant in Ukraine before the war.
- Ukrainian companies also produce the TB2's engines, and Turkey has sold more than 20 Bayraktars to Kyiv over the course of two years. Some experts believe the number of TB2s in the Ukrainian arsenal could be even higher.
- Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 armed drones at work. The Russian BUK was destroyed in the area of Malina Zhytomyr region. — Ukrainian military Bayraktar TB2 were supplied by Turkey. And they are working very smoothly against the Russian weaponry https://t.co/n5uzsyJGbK
- Many observers believe that Russia's offensive is not going as planned, and it was foolish of Moscow to send in the troops without first wiping out Ukraine's air force, including its drones.
- Yet Russia's failure to take out the TB2s could be down to several reasons. First off, it doesn't have air supremacy over all of Ukraine's airspace.
- “Russian Aero-Space Forces have local air superiority over certain theatres, but not true air supremacy over the entire Ukrainian airspace,” Can Kasapoglu, director of defence at Istanbul-based think tank EDAM, told Middle East Eye.
- “Besides, the Russian military struck a large number of Ukrainian air bases, but some still have operational runways and facilities. Manned and unmanned operations of Ukraine are attacked, but not totally disrupted."
- Robert Lee, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, says Russia had the capability to destroy TB2s on the ground and at airfields at the beginning of the war, but failed to do so for some reason.
- “In addition, it doesn't appear their air defences that escort ground forces into battle were prepared to face the TB2. Not fully clear why that is,” he told MEE.
- The footage released by the Ukrainian military indicates TB2s haven't really been threatened by any air defence systems. Evidence so far shows most sorties being carried out easily and without retaliation.
- So far there is only open source confirmation of one downed TB2, although the Russian defence ministry claimed that it shot down three of them over the weekend.
- Kasapoglu says one of the videos being circulated online shows a TB2 destroying a Buk, a Russian mobile air defence system.
- “Lessons learned from Syria, Libya and Karabakh already suggested the combat effectiveness of the Turkish drones against mobile Soviet-Russian air defence weaponry time and again, especially when they lack networked sensor capacity,” he told MEE.
- “It remains to be seen, however, whether other successful kills will follow and the Buk strike will turn into a pattern in the course of the war.”
- 'Lessons learned from Syria, Libya and Karabakh already suggested the combat effectiveness of the Turkish drones against mobile Soviet-Russian air defence weaponry time and again'
- - Can Kasapoglu, director of defence at EDAM
- Kasapoglu says another incident involving the destruction of a convoy belonging to Russia-allied Chechen fighters near Kyiv was more significant, as these troops are highly experienced units known for their brutality, “which could have tipped the tactical situation there”.
- One Turkish source told MEE that the Ukrainians have been using what he calls “hit and run” tactics to overwhelm the Russian troops. The source said TB-2’s low visibility and detectabilty due to their low radar cross section values help them considerably against the Russian defence systems.
- “Also open source information suggests the Russians didn’t bring any electronic warfare capabilities with its convoys driving deep into Ukrainian territory," the source said.
- Kasapoglu agreed that the Bayraktars appear to be escaping Russian systems.
- “It seems that Turkish drones' datalink complexes are staying below the electromagnetic jamming envelopes of principal Russian electronic warfare systems like Krasukha-4, which is optimised to jam onboard systems of manned aircraft,” he said.
- “In the Karabakh war, drones were decisive weapons. In Ukraine, they act as tactical force-multipliers and interestingly psychological warfare assets in the digital infosphere."
- Others had questioned the effectiveness of Russian electronic warfare systems against the TB2 before the Ukraine war even broke out.
- Three Russian supply trucks were struck in the lastest Bayraktar TB2 video from Ukraine 🇷🇺🇺🇦Here you can see some Russian soldiers inspecting the damage, while others simply run off. pic.twitter.com/QAnv6tRO01
- Analysts Stijn Mitzer and Joost Oliemans, who run a popular defence blog called Oryxspioenkop, wrote in December that Russia’s most modern electronic warfare systems failed to combat TB2 in Nagorno-Karabakh. They added that surface-to-air-missile systems such as Pantsir, Tor and Buk, which have been deployed in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, also proved to have little ability against the Turkish drones.
- As war raged on Monday, more TB2 footage was leaked on social media, this time showing the drones destroying some Russian trucks - again with relative ease.
- “We'll have to wait until the war is over to make any strong conclusions about how effective TB2 were, but it appears they are playing a role right now and I suspect Russia will redouble its efforts to counter them,” the Foreign Policy Research Institute's Lee said.

- In a video that went viral on Twitter Sunday night, a massive explosion rips through what appears to be a Russian convoy, scoring a direct hit on a surface-to-air missile system.
- The black-and-white footage, posted to the account of the Ukrainian armed forces, is one of several that have emerged on social media in recent days showing the devastating impact of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian hardware. As the drone’s payload explodes in the video—which appears to be a cellphone recording of a screen in a Ukrainian drone facility—people at the facility can be heard gasping in awe before breaking out in cheers and applause.
- The video racked up more than 3 million views on Twitter in two days. “Have fear, enemies! There will be no peace for you on our earth!” the Ukrainian armed forces wrote in the video’s caption.
- The star of this video and others circulating on Twitter is the Bayraktar TB2—a type of Turkish drone that the Ukrainian military has increasingly deployed against Russian forces in recent days. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian military said that Bayraktar drones had destroyed one tank and two surface-to-air missile systems overnight. In other videos shared on Twitter, Bayraktar drones, in use by the military since at least 2021, are shown blowing up what appears to be a Russian fuel convoy and a group of supply trucks.
- The drones are small and lightweight, (around seven times lighter than the U.S. military’s Reaper drone,) with a 12-meter wingspan that allows them to remain in the sky for up to 30 hours at a time. Each drone can each carry four laser-guided missiles, according to promotional material from Baykar Technologies, the company that produces them.
- Ukraine’s drone campaign has contributed to its early successes in slowing the Russian advance, and is revealing unexpected weaknesses on the part of the Russian army, U.S. and European military analysts say. Perhaps more significantly, analysts add, the videos are also becoming an increasingly prominent part of Ukraine’s information war – giving Russian invaders a reason to fear their enemy, and providing a vital boost for Ukrainian morale amid fears of a coming military onslaught. Even so, the drones are unlikely to change the long-term course of the war, analysts point out.
- “The footage released by the Ukraine military shows serious defects in Russian air defense cover, which is a surprise for many observers,” says Arda Mevlütoğlu, a Turkish military and aerospace analyst. “The footage is also very useful for PR and psychological warfare.”
- Reliable and accurate military drones were once the exclusive purview of the U.S. military. But the technology has become more commonplace in recent years, and is now a fixture of many 21st century battlefields. And Turkey is now the preeminent supplier. In the last two years, Turkish Bayraktar drones have appeared not only in Ukraine, but also Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Libya and Syria. Last year in Ethiopia, a rebel force was bearing down on the capital Addis Ababa before the government repelled them with the drones. In the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in 2020, Turkish drones proved decisive in the Azeri victory against Armenia – a Russian ally.
- “In recent years, the Bayraktars have scored some really famous successes,” says Tony Osborne, the London bureau chief of Aviation Week, a publication focused on the aerospace industry. “I would argue that it’s now the most famous drone of them all.”

- The video shared by the Ukrainian armed forces on Sunday reveals one of the drones’ key selling points: that they are capable of inflicting disproportionate damage on enemy hardware, far more cheaply than other drones, and at low risk. Osborne estimates that the Bayraktar drones were sold to Ukraine at a cost in the single-digit millions of dollars each – but that the Russian surface-to-air missile system destroyed in the video on Sunday could be worth up to $50 million.
- “The crucial thing about these is that they are cheap, and when they’re cheap you’re not so worried about losing them,” he says. “You can throw them into a fight and if they do score a dramatic hit, like we saw yesterday, suddenly you’re winning the attritional war.”
- Osborne estimates that Ukraine likely has around 20 Baykar drones in its operational arsenal. In December, Bloomberg reported that Ukraine had placed orders for two dozen more, citing officials. Baykar did not respond to requests for comment.
- For Turkey, a NATO member, the drone sales to Ukraine align with its military interests – namely preserving the balance of power in the Black Sea region, according to Galip Dalay, a specialist on Turkish and Middle Eastern politics at Chatham House, a London international affairs think tank.
- While Bayraktar drones are manufactured by a private company, Baykar Technologies, the drones are widely seen to be an arm of Turkish foreign policy. The company’s chief technology officer, Selçuk Bayraktar, is the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “Countries like the U.S., China, Israel, denied to sell Ukraine armed UAVs,” said Haluk Bayraktar, the company’s CEO and Selçuk’s brother, during a webinar in May 2021. “Turkey was the only country to accept to sell Ukraine this technology.”
- Read More: The World Is Watching Russia Invade Ukraine. But Russian Media Is Telling a Different Story
- Turkish foreign policy has also animated the presence of Bayraktar drones in Syria, Libya and Azerbaijan – all battlefields where Russian and Turkish proxies face off. “Drones give Turkey a geopolitical edge,” Dalay says. “It’s one thing to engage in conventional fighting in places like Libya or Syria, but it’s another thing to employ drones. Drones make Turkey’s job easier.”
- In other cases, like Ethiopia, Turkish drone sales are likely motivated more by economic drivers than political ones. Turkey attached no political conditions to its drone exports, unlike the U.S., according to Mevlütoğlu.
- The videos of Bayraktar drones visiting death upon Russian convoys have almost certainly been shared by the Ukrainian military to raise morale. But with a large column of Russian vehicles trundling toward Kyiv, any Ukrainian morale stemming from videos of drone strikes is likely to be short-lived. Baykar, on the other hand, looks set to reap the rewards long into the future. “Now that Turkey has a growing defense industry, you want to showcase your items as battle-tested,” Dalay says. “Those kinds of conflict zones have become major PR for the Turkish drone industry.”

- The Ukrainian military destroyed a howitzer with a Turkish-made Bayraktar drone following the killing of a soldier by Russia-backed separatists on Tuesday.
- Rodion Miroshnik, who represents the Lugansk People’s Republic, was quoted by TASS as saying that Kyiv violated the 2014 Minsk Agreement, which bans the use of foreign unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and combat aircraft along the “line of contact” between Ukrainian soldiers and the rebels.
- “The Ukrainian military declares in a deliberate and even demonstrative fashion that they are violating the Minsk Agreements,” Miroshnik said.
- The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces stated that a battery of D-30 howitzers fired at the joint forces in Hranitne, Zhytomyr Oblast in the afternoon, injuring two soldiers, one of whom died later. Following the incident, a ceasefire was requested by Ukrainian forces. There was no response by the rebels, leading to the UAV strike.
- According to the statement, the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces ordered the drone strike to force the ceasefire. It added that the drone didn’t cross the “line of contact” during the operation. Media reports suggested that Bayraktar fired a guided missile at the target.

- — Defence of Ukraine (@DefenceU) October 26, 2021
- 
- The incident comes on the heels of the killing of four Ukrainian soldiers in clashes with the separatists in June and another less than a month ago. Ukrainian armed forces have been in conflict with the separatists in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions since Russia took over the Crimean peninsula in 2014. The war has claimed more than 13,000 lives.
- Ukraine signed a deal in 2019 to procure Bayraktar TB2 drones for its military. Last month, the eastern European country signed another contract to build the UAVs domestically.
- Produced by the Turkish company Baykar, the Bayraktar UAV is capable of remotely controlled and autonomous operation. It’s used for intelligence, surveillance, and offensive operations.
- The drone is armed with anti-tank missiles, precision-guided missiles, and laser-guided rockets and can fly up to 220 kilometers (136 miles) per hour and stay in the air for up to 27 hours.

URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2021/12/17/to-hide-from-ukraines-drones-russian-troops-could-lay-smoke-screens/
- A TDA-2K smoke vehicle conceals an Iskander-M rocket position during a 2019 exercise.
- The Ukrainian military is getting new killer drones. The Russian military, acutely aware of the threat they pose, is preparing to hide its troops from the Ukrainian robots using a millennia-old countermeasure.
- Smoke.
- The propeller-driven TB-2 drone, a product of Turkish firm Baykar Defense, played a major role in the 2020 territorial war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Azerbaijan’s TB-2s plinked poorly-defended Armenian tanks and artillery, contributing to Azerbaijan’s lopsided victory.
- Kiev took note. The Ukrainian air force already had a dozen TB-2s on order—the first new warplanes the air arm had acquired in a generation. In 2020 the Ukrainian navy placed its own order for five TB-2s. Kiev and Ankara separately negotiated a deal for Ukrainian industry to build an additional 48 TB-2s under license.
- This spring Ukraine’s TB-2s flew their first surveillance mission over the restive Donbas region, where anti-government separatists, backed by Russian troops, have been in control since 2015.
- And in October, a Ukrainian TB-2 conducted the type’s first air strike in Donbas, employing a tiny guided munition to destroy a separatist howitzer.
- Perhaps planning to sharply escalate the conflict, Russia this spring began massing a powerful force—100,000 troops, 1,200 tanks—along its border with Ukraine. A host of specialist forces support the potential invasion army. They include ground-surveillance radars, radio-jammers and GPS-spoofers.
- The jammers and spoofers could help air-defense troops confuse, ground or shoot down Ukraine’s drones. But the Kremlin isn’t taking any chances. In case the electronic-warfare and air-defense troops fail, the Russian army deploys a last-ditch drone-defense in the form of smoke-generators.
- The Russian army long has fielded smoke vehicles as part of its chemical-warfare battalions. The smoke troops lay down screens to obscure other forces.
- “Smoke” in this case is something of a misnomer, as the agents the vehicles can lay down aren’t always just ash. Special aerosols carrying tiny flakes of metal not only can hide troops from visual observation—they can hide them infrared sensors, as well.
- Social-media users this summer spotted Russian TDA-2K smoke vehicles and other smoke generators on the move, possibly as part of the wider build-up near Ukraine. The wheeled TDA-2K can lay down a half-mile-long smoke screen that lingers for hours.
- The TDA-2Ks seem to deploy alongside Osa air-defense vehicles. The Osa with its 10-mile-range, radar-guided missiles is one of Russia’s main anti-drone systems. The TDA-2Ks could protect the Osas from the very drones the Osas are hunting.
- The Russian army late last year practiced this approach to drone-defense. In the December 2020 exercise in Chelyabinsk, a TDA-3 smoke generator laid down a screen, obscuring Tor-M1 and Pantsir-S air-defense systems. Radars detected incoming Tachyon and Orlan drones and passed the coordinates to the Tor and Pantsir crews, who shot down the drones as far as seven miles away.
- If there’s a downside to anti-drone smoke, it’s that it’s hard not to notice. The very presence of a smoke screen is a strong indication that something valuable is inside it. In that sense, smoke truly is a last line of defense.
- Recognizing this risk, Russian smoke troops sometimes lay down decoy screens that obscure ... nothing.
- For all the smoke troops’ efforts, the right sensors might allow TB-2s and other drone types to see through the screens. The TB-2’s standard sensor is a multi-mode camera built by Turkish firm Aselsan. The camera can switch between daylight, infrared and near-infrared modes.
- Near-infrared is especially useful for locating manmade objects in smoke.

- Ukraine's then-president Petro Poroshenko inspects a new TB-2 in 2019.
- We knew Ukraine had Turkish-made hunter-killer drones, each capable of finding and destroying enemy armored vehicles without exposing crews to enemy fire. We didn’t know many of the propeller-driven Bayraktar TB-2s Kiev managed to acquire as a powerful Russian army massed along the border with Ukraine.
- Until now. “All in all, Ukraine has approximately 20 Bayraktar drones, but we will not stop there,” Lt. Col. Yuri Ignat, a Ukrainian air force spokesperson, told Amberin Zaman, a reporter for Al-Monitor.
- Twenty drones might not seem like a lot when even Ukraine’s weary air force possesses around 125 manned combat aircraft—and Russia’s own air force can muster hundreds of manned planes for an attack on Ukraine.
- The Ukrainian armed-drone fleet perhaps seems even more minuscule considering Russia has staged thousands of armored vehicles—enough for at least 75 battalion tactical groups—within quick striking distance of Ukraine.
- But the TB-2 in the right conditions and with the right support is a potent weapon. The 21-foot-long, camera-equipped drone, operated by a three-person crew on the ground, can carry a pair of Smart Micro Munition guided missiles as far as 80 miles in line-of-sight mode.
- During a brief but bitter territorial war in 2020, Azerbaijan’s fleet of reportedly around 10 TB-2s destroyed no fewer than 567 Armenian vehicles, artillery pieces and air-defense systems. It was a bloody rout for the Armenians.
- Russia isn’t Armenia. And a possible, wider war between Russia and Ukraine would be much more violent—and dangerous for anything that flies—than the relatively low-intensity Azerbaijan-Armenia war.
- True, the TB-2 makes for a fleeting target. And it’s worth noting that Azerbaijan’s TB-2s not only managed to slip past Armenian air-defenses most of the time, the drones also wreaked havoc on those defenses. TB-2s knocked out three Strela-10 short-range air-defense vehicles, 16 Osa SHORAD vehicles and a ZSU-23-4 mobile gun.
- In return, the Armenians shot down two, maybe three, of the TB-2s. Armenia reportedly tried and failed to jam the drones’ command signal using its Krasukha-4 electronic-warfare vehicles.
- But Russian forces have more and better air-defense and electronic-warfare systems than Armenian forces have, or had. Russia deploys thousands of overlapping man-portable missiles and self-propelled guns and surface-to-air missiles.
- That said, Russian forces have struggled at times to counter small drones. Islamic State militants and anti-regime rebels repeatedly launched swarms of explosives-laden small drones at Russian bases in Syria.
- Russian radio-jammers scrambled some of the drones. Pantsir air-defense vehicles shot down others. But a few got through.
- A TB-2 is bigger than an off-the-shelf quadcopter— and, in theory, easier to detect. But it’s also faster. And it can fire its missiles at targets miles away.
- All these factors might be moot, however. It doesn’t matter how effective Ukraine’s drones are, or how ineffective Russia’s air-defenses might be against them, if the drones never get off the ground.
- A devastating bombardment by artillery, air- and sea-launched cruise missiles and ground-based ballistic missiles surely would precede a Russian offensive across Ukraine.
- Considering how much the Russians fear and loathe the TB-2, the drone units—their command trailers, transmitters and crews and the air-vehicles themselves—undoubtedly would be near the top of the list of targets.
- Undeterred, Kiev has placed orders for additional TB-2s—and also has inked a deal with Turkey to produce the drone under license.

- It was used to destroy enemy artillery in Donbas, which fired on the village of Granitne.
- According to the Ukrainian Military here:
- “Drones were used for the first time to destroy enemy artillery that were shelling the village of Granitne, after which the militants claimed the alleged liberation of the Armed Forces of the village of Staromaryivka.
- Video of the destruction of an enemy artillery installation:
- “It was decided to use Ukrainian strike drones to work from a distance of more than 15 km, to save the lives of civilians and soldiers. In response, to save the lives of soldiers and civilians, a Bayraktar UAV was raised, a battery was found, and a cannon was destroyed by a missile. At this moment.
- The calculations of others fled. But this is not true. Because they raised more than one bird. The destruction of one calculation of the enemy artillery system was confirmed, the others left their positions.”
- The drones have been used by others before, you can read more about that here.

- I cant believe they ran away after the hit.Did they drop a bag of sand on it?
- It is never pleasant seeing footage of people who are about to die. Yet they got up and fled after impact??? What ordnance does this drone carry?
- Yes, it looked like the ordnance barely detonated. You’d have to ask whether the artillery piece was genuinely knocked out.
- Seem to remember something from, I think, the first gulf war where laser guided bombs filled with concrete instead of explosives were destroying tanks. Low cost, very effective and low risk of collateral damage.
- It’s said the IDF uses concrete practice rounds to as low-collateral munitions to hit Hamas targets. Not sure how true that is.
- It’s true, more here https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/the-story-of-idfs-innovative-tactic-to-avoid-civilian-casualties-in-gaza-663170
- RAF Tornados definitely used Concrete Bombs in GW2.
- The survivors all appeared to be on the opposite side of the gun to where the weapon struck. Definately a small charge, but I suggest that the fact that no one moved from the side the weapon struck tells us something…
- Horrible, to see what might have been a fatal strike for someone – certainly a very frightening event for the survivors.
- Hopefully, a proper ceasefire and peace deal can be negotiated someday but sadly no sign of that yet. Another long low intensity war for the world to deal with… what a waste.
- CR
- So true. Leaders who make decisions seldom pay in blood for them. The irony is that there is a peace deal, Minsk, in placed signed ready to roll but the Ukrainians refuse, although they signed it, to implement it. There has been little pressure from the West to do so as having a running sore on the Russian border is perfect for some. So the houses of the locals, one up from or still peasants in many cases, get shelled by the Ukrainian Army, usually with 100mm mortars or 122mm artillery, which then gets returned at the military units which… Read more »
- Hang on a minute your blaming Ukraine for Russia causing a war in the eastern part of its country after it annexed part of the Ukraine it’s the rebels shooting and bombing the Ukrainian civilians not the other way round do subscribe to RT or something
- Well that depends if Putin’s pressured enough to withdraw ,this is his doing after all, you cannot blame Ukraine for retaliating .
- Ukraine is hardly the bad guy here, it has been the victim of a Russian backed insurrection. Rather then stabilising a win for Russia the West should be helping them to get their country back….
- Hi dave12,
- I am definately not blaming Ukraine for retaliating.
- My comment was underlining the fact that wars are awful no matter what the justification and that video underlined the point.
- Sometimes you have to fight because the alternative is potential far worse e.g. WW2 against the Nazis. The world is flawed. I accept that and believe we need strong well equipped armed forces for that reason.
- Sad but there it is.
- Cheers CR
- Fair enough CR you are right.
- But is this particular case those manning the weapon could choose not tot fight return to life before the war, as you say you fight when the alternative is worse. I don’t recall hundred or thousands killed in eastern Ukraine before this war which suggests the alternative for them is not worse,
- Dan, In answer to your question the main weapon used by the TB2 is the Small 6kg MAM-C which is based on the Turkish version of the 70mm rocket. https://www.roketsan.com.tr/en/products/mam-c-smart-micro-munition
- Thanks Farouk.
- Dan, A lot more information on the above story: https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2021/10/baptism-by-fire-ukraines-bayraktar-tb2.html
- Thanks F, just read.
- Impressive system.
- How about the AAC buy 100?
- We could just arm Watchkeeper…and have a far more capable platform…armed with 4 Thales FFLMM (sold in the US as the Textron Fury). It’s basically a glide version of Martlet/LMM.

- The TB2 is by all accounts a cheaper drone. I admire the ingenuity of countries who cannot afford to design, develop and build high end drones but can mass produce cheaper more affordable options.
- Mike wrote: The TB2 is by all accounts a cheaper drone. A good point and harking back to the ubiquitous T34 during WW2 (58701 built during WW2) as opposed to a total of 49777 German tanks over the same time frame, the Turks have in place the numbers to not only be everywhere at once, but to be able to accept losses in its UAV Fleet (over 30 in Libya and the same in Syria) and not lose step. In contrast the UK has purchased 10 Reapers which they are about to replace with 16 Protectors . Not only that whilst… Read more »
- Project Alvina could change that, although its working on the swarming software not the platform – but designed for cheap mass drone use. Also LMM / Martlet is a cheap weapon (there is also a glide version that can be carried by small drones like Watchkeeper). The RAF has formed several new squadrons for Alvina swarming tech – one hopes they stand them up on a few low cost platforms soon.
- Must surely also be benefit in providing army wildcats with the option of martlet for use against non heavy armour targets of opportunity.. especially in peer conflicts where drone jamming may become an issue.
- “Quantity has a quality all its own.”
- wish the MOD would listen to your sound advice!
- It’s amazing how we keep forgetting the lessons learned. We like our hi tech kit with all the bells and whistles, trouble is one bit of bad luck leads to a loss and with it x% of the available force.
- The scene from a bridge too far comes to mind, “we can’t afford to lose a single aircraft”.
- That’s rapidly becoming a key point of any military briefing. Losses will occur, regardless how good the kit, bad luck happens, Intel can be wrong etc etc. We have too few eggs in a fragile basket…
- Yep tech is always claimed to be the force multiplier. I remember the F22 went up against 4th gen fighters in a mock air battle and took them out without a single loss. The trouble is the Raptor couldn’t physically carry as many missiles as the opponents it took out 🙂 So is a real battle the Raptor would return to base leaving the remaining enemy planes to complete their mission.
- kinetic round.
- From my days of doing cold War Soviet kit recognition training it looks like they where the venerable D30 122mm guns set up in the age old Soviet deployment pattern… Line’ em up all in a row. Not a very big bang but it doesn’t need to be. Any damage to the gun, trunions, training base or wheels or towing equipment is going to render it in op. As for everyone legging it… Objective achieved. The gun crews didn’t know if another strike was inbound. For that matter they will now be reluctant to go back to the guns knowing… Read more »
- Good to see that they were able to leg it after the strike- if the gun can be knocked out with minimum casualties, that’s a bonus.
- Judging by what I have read and the basis for Germany’s disapproval I suspect this was a deliberate minimum damage strike by Ukraine. Technically they should not be using drones due to previous ceasefire agreements but clearly this sort of continuing provocation by the militants cannot be endlessly tolerated so the compromise was likely use the drone but minimise loss of life and collateral damage. Message given, fear instilled but minimises likelihood of Russian retaliation.
- Yes, definitely, the Soviets produced thousands of them. But I would say it was a mission fail. Perhaps the gun is out of action, but with the poor imagery resolution, it’s hard to tell what damage has been done to it. Furthermore, to be objective, it is better to kill the crew than the gun, as the crew have the operational experience which takes time to retrain. Can’t believe the crew set up the guns in front of the tree line, with absolutely no camo, basics! Looking at Roketsan’s website, the weapon may have been the unpowered MAM-L or smaller… Read more »
- it certainly does look like a D 30.
- Russian sites have confirmed that it was.
- Well thats what you get for shelling a village well done Ukraine.
- Except that it seems that it was the Ukrainians who started the exchange of fire this time, onto housing, with this TB-2 raid being a response to the deadly return fire onto their units (2 soldiers, one dead, were hit not villagers) that resulted. This goes on multiple times a week all along the demarcation line. We only heard about this incident due to the first use of the TB-2.
- I’m sure the Russian are just as bad with the shelling which has not been highlighted before, look at MH17 disaster and also its been proven that FSB snipers in use in the Donbass area I find it a bit hard to fathom people excusing dictatorships actions ,remember Putin made the first moves by invading the Ukraine a people who wanted to turn away from sphere of influence of what is essentially a mafia state.
- Yes, very true!
- Interesting development, I wonder when we can expect to see their version of loyalwingman?
- Behold the first two-seat 5th Generation fighter variant in the world, the Chinese Chengdu J-20S (also known as J-20AS or J-20B). This configuration is probably made to boost cooperation between the J-20 and future unmanned “loyal wingmen” aircraft.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8OlCPnDXlM
- “Images and video footage have emerged on Chinese social media platforms showing what appears to be a two-seat prototype of the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group (CAIG) J-20A fifth-generation multirole fighter aircraft.”

- It appears they have something similar in design to Kratos!

- 3 more F35B’s heading to the UK today, fresh from the factory.👍
- I forgot to mention, and with loyal wingman? “In a separate article, Global Times quoted Sun Cong, chief designer of the FC-31, deployed on carriers—an F-35 lookalike—as saying “people will … see good news on the next-generation aircraft carrier-based fighter jet” in the coming year. Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member James Inhofe (R-Okla.) said in a confirmation hearing Oct 5 that “Our commanders tell us that by 2025, the Chinese will have more fifth-generation stealth fighters on the front line than we do.” Asked for context, a spokesperson for Inhofe said the information was based on testimony provided by… Read more »
- You missed out the part of the article that say the USAF will have 652 5th gen fighters by 2025, F35 and F22. With F35 deliveries continuing for many years after. And that figure doesn’t include USN and USMC F35B/C numbers or the 12 nations outside of the USA that currently have F35 in service or on order and counting. Add in the 29 vessels that will be 5th gen F35 capable across all allied nation’s. And that’s a huge amount of deployable capability to give the Chinese sleepless nights. And the J20 and f35 copy cat are completely unproven.
- The Chicom’s seem to be copying the exteriors of F-35 or F-22 type aircraft, without knowing what’s really inside them! They are a lot more complicated inside them.
- China has also converted some old 1950s J6s to drones. Basically worthless airframes that will mean an enemy will need to waist a missile knocking out.
- Exactly, I posted this in another thread. Clever these Chinese!
- “The JASDF’s fleet of some 215 F-15J aircraft bears the brunt of scramble tasking,” he wrote. “Since 2016, the JASDF has often launched four aircraft for each scramble.
- “These daily scrambles are gradually wearing the F-15J fleet out. The concern is that China has some six times more fighters than the JASDF, and could further ramp up intrusions whenever it considers appropriate. The in-service life of Japan’s F-15J fleet is now almost a decision that lies with China,” Layton said.
- If Turkey can manufacture drones ( plus associated ammunition) like this – why isn’t the UK. Cheap and cheerful has a place still it seems for a range of missions.
- It really does beggar belief that we haven’t manufactured something like this in the UK, but have to buy it from abroad (Watchkeeper, Predator and Reaper etc). The first time I got up close to a Predator, I thought it was just an upscaled RC plane. It’s made from pretty much the same materials, fibreglass body and fibreglass wrapped foam wings, with small microlite engine stuffed in the back. Avionics wise, it has a EO turret with a laser designator, a satellite and a line of sight data-link, plus the fight control stuff and that was it. But was shocked… Read more »
- The early Reaper were the video feed wasn’t even encrypted and could be intercepted by the enemy with a basic receiver, It really wasn’t far off a large RC plane.
- There are a couple of companies in the UK that could easily build a TB2/Predator equivalent such as Blue Bear Systems and Spirit Aerosystems.
- Good point. That the country with the world’s best engine maker has no indigenous fast jet for export is somewhat understandable given the enormous cost of development. But for relatively simple drone offerings, which are all about maximizing endurance, it is hard to believe the UK isn’t a world leader yet.
- Because we were until recently the world experts at overcomplicated perfectionist solutions?
- Now with fast prototyping and hopefully design-by-committee and design-to-bright-ideas consigned to the history books then maybe this will come good.
- I agree it is pretty amazing that a large model makers dream has not been produced. The platform + engine is the easy bit. Radars we pretty much have from the Captor program. Munitions we have anyway from plenty of other programs.
- So what is left
- Flight controls; and Deconfliction software – which is probably the hardest part; and CMS?
- Just as far as the engines, you see it over and over again . . . Brits order Rolls Royce engines for their Apaches . . . Results in better range than their American counterparts . . . Better F35 engine design etc. The longest endurance drones in the world (Global Hawk) are already powered by Rolls Royce. It seems to be an indigenous competitive advantage (read: it could propel sales) not utilized to its potential by the rest of industry and government.
- Good points, Ron. We (UK) always were superb on invention and development but crap at application and sales. The less developed countries can’t afford the expensive kit so spend their resources on home grown stuff which – as we found out – is just as effective as the gold plated kit we ‘developed’ countries buy.
- T’was ever thus…
- UK’s Cosworth engines makes drone engines for guess who, the US
- Hi OldShool It seems we only buy from big companies then add expensive bits and cut the order… and good defence companies are allowed to be sold abroad Thanks Ian
- Well if we had not massively screwed up / over engineered Watchkeeper with SAR, plus EO/IR targeting and fitted it with the glide version of LMM / Martlet, then we would have one.
- Well UK is a over-regulated country with a giant bureaucracy. Public discussion in West – not only UK – is how to distribute money and how to cripple the initiative unless it is to be done by the State and their friends. The cultural incentives are similar.
- Turkey has become a world leader on this type of drone class. What makes them effective is the electronic warfare they use to blind air defence systems and the smart munitions.. Poland is getting 25 TB2 and the UK is has shown interest and is currently assessing a proposal from Turkey to get some TB2 a Turkish minister has said.
- Utter nonsense from Turkey.
- We are definitely not looking at TB2.
- Or any other Turkish drone for that matter.
- Unless it can fly in unsegregated airspace we’re not interested, hence Protector and Watchkeeper.
- We also have 10 Reaper that are in a different class. If we were going to do anything that would cost money we’d retain them in service.
- Ok it’s gonna sound callous but in the long run it would be better to kill as many ‘Russians’ as possible. There’s no opposition in Russia alive or at best free. The only political pressure Putin could face over Ukraine is dead soldiers coming back to Russian towns. Which is worse 1,000 dead now or 10.000 dead over the next 20 years. Putin and his cronies will only change strategy if he thinks it will cost him power.
- But they won’t be Russian soldiers. They’ll either be Ukrainians who are ethnic Russians or employees of Wagner group or some similar private company.
- Good point at start but large majority these days will be Russian. Artillery, Comms etc 100% Russian. Last report I read 2/3 of pre war inhabitants have left and basic services are a mess. The rebel areas are being run by Russian gangsters. We have economic sanctions and they were working until EU/Germany blew a gaping hole in them with the gas deal. Now we’ve got to use what pressure point we still have.
- I’ve been following this civil war quite closely since it started following the coup in Kiev in 2014 where the new regime were determined to crush any opposition, leading to serious conflicts that ended up in a stalemate after Ukraine’s army took serious casualties. Indeed, whilst there are still disputes over the amount of Russian involvement the odds are that there was, especially in the supply of gear.   The population is a minimum over 600,000, they are the ones that now have Russian (as opposed to their original Ukrainian) citizenship, living in Donbas and Luhansk, so probably around a… Read more »
- Minsk is now controled by your despot friend, Putinbot since he has showed his true colours, so is not an honest broker!
- Can’t claim Putin as a friend. Minsk and Belarus were merely the acceptable to all parties location for the 4 way talks, who controls it is irrelevant. The Minsk Protocol is an agreement which tried bring lasting peace to the Donbas region of Ukraine. Written by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine (Ukraine, Russia, and OSCE) and mediated by the leaders of France and Germany in the so-called Normandy Format. The main results were a plan to integrate Donbas into Ukraine in a way acceptable to all, not independance. Nothing has resulted as Kiev has refused to talk directly with… Read more »
- I don’t think Belarus is acceptable to all any longer. Need to find a new country acceptable to all and the Protocol renegotiated, so Ukraine can move forward.
- Russian TV have picked up the story: https://twitter.com/Shtirlitz53/status/1453074999787597824?s=20
- there were talks going around that the u.k drone taranis was to undergo test carrying weapons its been very quiet on taranis for a good while the videos showing initial flight tests were very impressive maybe armed taranis drones could ioperate from the u.k carriers adding yet another capability to the effectivness and versitality of the carrier fleet.
- And about time. All that home grown potential with Taranis not being fully ulitilsed.
- I’d be very surprised if we don’t see some of this tech and the lessons learned from Taranis used in future aircraft (Tempest) and drones (Vixen) UK‘s largest defense and security company BAE Systems has performed flight trials of the MAGMA to successfully demonstrate two flow control technologies that could revolutionize future aircraft design. BAE Systems has developed the MAGMA in collaboration with researchers at The University of Manchester. The MAGMA successfully completed a series of trials recently at the Llanbedr Airfield. The technologies have been designed to create better-performing aircraft that are lighter, more reliable and cheaper to operate. Not… Read more »
- Put 10 of these at 35km from a Type 31 or 26 firing missile similar to Spikes and they don’t have the range to hit the drones.
- They could jam the RF guidance from Spike with ease…
- And it is RF, the Fibre Optic onlu goes out to 15km..
- Drones clearly have a place in warfare but do they have a place where the opposition has adequate AD systems? So far the TB-2 in particular has not really been up against properly trained SAMs in a radar heavy IADS. For example an isolated Pantsr is very vulnerable to a UAV operating above the range of its missiles and is not how it should be used. It will be interesting to see how they perform if/when Idlib flares up or if the Russians respond to this use. UAV are also very vulnerable to AAM or a fighter’s gun, a Spitfire… Read more »

- It is a good point well made that a TB2 wouldn’t last long against a 57/40mm radar laid auto cannon.
- Particularly with smart ammo
- Yes but if it launches a few missiles to disable it it would have done it’s job. Not sure the cost differential of 40mm v’s one of those drones but I suspect the drones are cheaper.
- Depends on the range and accuracy of the missiles on the drone.
- If the ** useful** kill range of the rockets is less than that of the 40mm then the drone is denied the combat area.
- The 40mm will also be excellebt at taking out missiles.
- It is a good point well made that a TB2 wouldn’t last long against a 57/40mm radar laid auto cannon.
- Why not? it just needs to lob missiles outside their range.
- The sort of rockets that we are talking about are not terribly long range. So the drone has to get pretty close.
- The rockets themselves are good targets for a 40mm cannon with prix fuzed ammunition.
- Let’s be honest this marginal usage case stuff. Against an enemy with low EW capabilities and no effective SAMs in theatre.
- Land Ceptor would easily take them out.
- Good stuff SB. The problem that these ‘not small’ drones like the TB-2 have is that they are the size of a aircraft and not particularly stealthy, as such they are a sitting duck for any decent ground or air based AD. Take Syria for example, when they first appeared whilst the fighting was still active, they were a new unknown factor that sent the Russian military in particular up a very rapid and steep learning curve. Almost certainly they now have a proper layered defence within their IADS to counter them, we will see when Idlib or NE Syria… Read more »
- Yes, that was my point.
- Any half well equipped force would take them out in moments.
- It is sort of the point I keep making that stocking up with junk systems has limited or no real utility. Just diverts resources and focus.
- Leadership seems to be at times all too frequently more comfortable dealing with what they have used and know rather than embrace the unknown that is the future. Not helped by the MoD being steeped in offensive thoughts rather than defence of the UK.
- Actually they took out S300 and Pantsir Russian air defence systems. They move slow and are small making it harder for defence systems designed to take out planes. The TB2 use electronic warfare systems too. Russia lost assets in Syria Libya and most recently Armenia karabak war. Russia protested the dale to Ukraine
- Akinci the latest bayraktsr drone has cruise missiles ranging 300km keeping them well away from from air defence systems. It has 40k altitude range
- Indeed that is the case, as well as OSA and Buk systems. But interestingly you are making the case that those with inadequate AD systems are vulnerable to UAVs as it was not ‘Russia’ that lost those systems, although it was their products, it was their customers. As far as I have seen, none of those systems were either operated by Russian Army/Air Force crews or were thecurrent Russian versions. As to range, Israel is providing Russia with excellent anti flying munition training in Syria so often it doesn’t matter how far away the launch platform is. As I said,… Read more »
- It’s Russian weapons Vs Turkish weapons proxy wars and so far Russia has lost every round. Both are fine tuning their tech . Russia is ahead in sir defence systems and Turkey is ahead of Russia in terms of drones tech. Turkey has acquired Russian S400 while simultaneously while developing its own air long range air defence systems. It already successfully developed 30km 70km range air defence systems to protect its bases , it’s just a matter of time until they won’t need the S400. TB3 drone will be a carrier version and Aksungur are naval drones giving the Turkish… Read more »
- A Spike LR type missile have +30km range, you can expect maybe a delay of 5 -10 years for the other side to copy it and that is being optimistic. Since they are already in operation for some time you can expect one in the other side anytime.
- Then you have the issue of hitting such a small missile.
- Maybe.
- But 57/40mm smart or prix is designed for the job.
- Russia has recently invested a lot of money kind of resurrecting 57mm from almost the dead. The realised that with modern munitions, targeting systems and a vast increase in ATGM it could be almost as effective as 100mm with many advantages. As part of this, new fragmenting AA rounds targetting helicopters, UAVs, drones, missiles and shells were developed. Quite different to the old Cold War Warsaw Pact 57mm AA guns
- I assume it is being developed all the time but there seems to be a a limited range due to fuel capacity versus warhead size. As I understand it the Spike LR2, which I think is the latest version but I could be wrong, can engage targets out to 5.5km when fired from the ground launcher, while from the helicopter that increases to a maximum range of 10km.
- Spike NLOS , apologies i made a mistake in the designation.
- “As the weapon leaped out of the launcher its solid-fuel rocket motor engaged and X-shaped wings and tail fins scissored out from the missile’s fuselage. As the missile streaked over the water at up to 425 miles per hour a flexibly mounted camera in the weapon’s nose transmitted video footage to the helicopter crew. A few minutes later the 156-pound Spike-NLOS missile plunged into a small boat floating on the Gulf—an impressive twenty miles away, three or four times the maximum range of its usual Hellfire armament.”
- The above is the US Army AH-64, that now have Spike NLOS.
- Thanks, I had not considered that version. But to get the range it has had to significantly increase in size making it easier to intercept compared to the LR2. The Russians have a similar missile under development called Baikal with an anticipated range of 15km from a vertical launch. No doubt the Chinese are there too.
- Bayraktar TB2 has a payload of 150kg so it could probably take 1 + guidance system..Or 2 with reduced fuel maybe.
- It is a 70kg missile, i don’t think naval SAM’s are focused on that kind of targets.
- CIWS would pick up and kill Spike NLOS with ease…
- Easy? And what about 20 of them guided to the most vulnerable parts of a ship?
- Well you can’t control 20 at once…and its launcher will be in range of the ship or compromised by EW.
- +30km distance are not in range of the ship SAM and if you have 20 TB2 drones with 1 missile each.
- This is where spear3 comes in. Long range, intelligent targeting between flights. We already have a super strike drone….spear3. What gets me is, like Brimstone, it isn’t now in service on almost all the platforms we have. AA

- Ukraine has been using Turkish drones to strike Russia's invading forces, Ukrainian government officials said on Saturday, as fighting continued for the third day.
- Ukraine's embassy in Turkey said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had struck a Russian military convoy in the southern city of Kherson using Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones.
- Accompanying the post was a video purportedly showing the aftermath of the strike.
- BREAKING — Ukraine has destroyed a Russian military convoy in Kherson by using Turkish Bayraktar TB2s: Ukrainian Embassy in Turkey pic.twitter.com/Fc97s4jmT9
- The Ukrainian defence ministry also said that TB2s had hit Russian forces near Hostomol airport, near Kyiv.
- There have been no comments from Russia in response to Ukraine's statements.
- Earlier this month, Ukraine and Turkey signed a series of agreements, including a deal that would expand the production capabilities of Turkish drone-maker Baykar in Ukraine.
- Its drones were deployed last year in Kiev's war against Russian-backed separatists in its eastern Donbas region.
- "[The] defence industry and aviation are the main driving force for our strategic partnership," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters at the time.
- "Baykar will expand its production of unmanned aerial vehicles in Ukraine, and Ukraine will strengthen its defence capabilities with these new technologies and jobs."
- Following the signing of the deal, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has a close but sometimes fraught relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, reiterated Ankara's support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

- Ukraine has destroyed the artillery of pro-Russian separatists in the country’s east in its first combat deployment of a Turkish drone, the Ukrainian military announced Tuesday.
- Footage published on the Ukrainian armed forces’ Facebook page showed the Bayraktar TB2k targeting and shooting a Soviet-era howitzer it identified as the pro-Russian forces’ D-30.
- The Ukrainian armed forces accused the separatists of wounding one soldier and killing another with the D-30 near the eastern town of Hranitne on the front line.
- “Bayraktar was used in order to force the enemy to cease fire,” the Ukrainian armed forces’ general staff said in a statement. “After that, the shelling of Ukrainian positions stopped.”
- The drone strike did not inflict any military or civilian casualties, Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted an unnamed source in the self-proclaimed, separatist-held Donetsk People’s Republic as saying Wednesday.
- The neighboring separatist-held Luhansk People’s Republic accused Kiev of using the Bayraktar in violation of ceasefire agreements that ban the deployment of foreign drones on the front line.
- Tuesday’s drone strike is the first since Turkey delivered the first batch of Bayraktar TB2 to Ukraine in July.
- The Turkish private company Baykar, which produces the armed drones, describes the TB2 model as a "medium altitude long endurance tactical unmanned aerial vehicle capable of conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and armed attack missions" with a range of up to 27 hours.
- Media reports said Kiev plans to buy around 50 Bayraktar TB2 drones, a flagship model that has been used in conflicts against Russian proxies in Syria, Libya and the Nagorno-Karabakh region at the center of a decades-long dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
- Ukraine and Turkey signed a memorandum in late September to establish a joint training and maintenance center for the drones in Ukraine. This month, Ukraine’s foreign minister said it plans to build a factory to produce Bayraktar drones in the country.
- The sale of drones to Kiev places Ankara in a delicate position, as Turkey also cooperates in the defense sector with Russia, Ukraine's rival.
- The Kremlin said Wednesday that Turkey’s supply of drones to Ukraine risks destabilizing the eastern Ukraine conflict despite Moscow’s “special” relations with Ankara.
- The Ukrainian army has been locked in a long-running conflict with separatist fighters in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014 after Moscow annexed the peninsula of Crimea from Kiev. The conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives.
- Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow denies.
- AFP contributed reporting.

- Outmanned, outgunned, and relying on sheer willpower to repel Russia’s invading armies, Ukraine’s soldiers may have one big ace up their sleeve.
- The Bayraktar TB2 drone, with a wingspan of 12 meters (472 inches) and equipped to carry four laser-guided bombs, has disabled multiple launch rocket systems as well as taken out columns of armored tanks and personnel transporters from the air, seemingly with impunity.
- To bolster their esprit de corps and demoralize the enemy, Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s defending troops have been uploading videos to social media taunting Russian troops with tales of the Bayraktar TB2’s lethal strikes executed out of the blue.
- A lemur born in Kyiv zoo was even given the name Bayraktar in tribute to the drone, as revealed by the mayor of the capital and former world heavyweight champion, Vitaly Klitschko, on Telegram.
- Turkey’s very first unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) may not be anywhere near as state-of-the-art as General Atomics’ MQ-9 Reaper or SkyGuardian drones. Yet its appeal lies in a brutally efficient cost-benefit ratio on the battlefield.
- At a price tag estimated to be as little as $1 million, these aircraft are easily expendable compared with other high-tech armaments. And while they have a range typically limited to 150 km (93 miles), they can loiter in the air for over 24 hours, waiting for the right moment to strike.
- “It gives Ukraine a new, qualitative edge over the enemy,” Lt. Col. Yuri Ignat, spokesman for the country’s Air Force Command, told Al-Monitor in an interview prior to the invasion. He claimed there were about 20 such UAVs at its disposal, “but we will not stop there.”
- Russia has had plenty of direct or indirect experience with TB2 in Idlib, Libya, Karabakh in 2020. It was an obvious threat since Ukraine bought them, and should have been one of the top Ukrainian capabilities to destroy at the beginning of the conflict. A surprising failure. https://t.co/4NM5fydEEp
- The drones are courtesy of Turkish defense contractor Baykar Makina, which says 257 are currently in service worldwide. The company also enjoys a direct link to the top echelon of Ankara’s leadership: One of the late founder’s two sons who run the company is married to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s younger daughter.
- First sold to Turkey’s own military eight years ago, the TB2 proved its worth largely out of sight from Western media during combat missions first in Syria and later Libya in 2020.
- It proved so effective against Armenian troops in the disputed Caucasus region of Nagorno-Karabakh that Azerbaijan’s head of state personally distinguished Baykar with an award for its contribution. Thanks to the drone’s success, Baykar says it ended up exporting UAVs worth $360 million dollars in 2020.
- Having changed the course of three separate conflicts that year, French daily Le Monde remarked last July that TB2s were “selling like hotcakes.” U.K. defense minister Ben Wallace weighed their purchase even though he had already spent $20 million a piece on SkyGuardian UAVs from General Atomics.
- Last May, Poland became the first EU member state to add the TB2 to its military arsenal, acquiring four systems of six drones each for a total of 24 unmanned aircraft. Only weeks later, Latvia’s defense minister hinted it may soon follow. It was Ukraine, however, that proved to be the very first customer to recognize the TB2’s value and import the technology.
- Is Latvia the Next NATO Nation to Order Bayraktar TB2 Drones? https://t.co/w2lPpDRcKv
- In economic terms, conventional forces are struggling to keep pace with advances in drone warfare. Most ground-to-air defense systems are typically expensive and designed to protect against threats like high-impact ordnance and combat jets rather than small, expendable UAVs.
- In one well-known example that gave the Pentagon’s top brass pause for thought, a U.S. ally shot down a tiny, off-the-shelf drone likely ordered from a catalog with a $3 million Patriot missile.
- “If I’m the enemy,” warned American Gen. David Perkins back in 2017, “I’m thinking, ‘Hey, I’m going to get on eBay and buy as many of these $300 quadcopters as I can and expend all the Patriot missiles out there.’”
- With the latest addition to Baykar’s drone program, the higher-altitude Akıncı B, Erdoğan boasted his was now “one of the three most advanced countries in the world in this technology.”
- The TB2’s success also highlights the delicate balancing act played by Turkey, a NATO member that straddles Europe and Asia. Invoking wartime clauses in a treaty that grants it power over the Bosporus strait, Turkey managed to shut down access to the Black Sea for incoming naval ships without triggering the ire of Moscow.
- By helping the Ukrainians while maintaining faith with the Russians, Erdoğan may come out the “biggest winner” in the conflict, remarked Turkey expert and Brooklyn College associate professor Louis Fishman in a column for Israel’s Haaretz published Wednesday.
- Prediction: Turkey is going to have some really good years ahead selling lots of TB2 drones around the world
- Lauren Kahn, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, argues the TB2’s value will likely decrease over time. Having seemingly underestimated the armed resistance they would face, Russia should be expected to deploy its full defensive capabilities, including cyberattacks, against the Turkish drone.
- “Bayraktar TB2s are slow, large, low-flying, and radio-controlled, making them comparatively easy targets for more sophisticated, layered air defense systems and electronic warfare capabilities,” Kahn wrote on Wednesday.
- Not all Western pundits have been happy to see Baykar’s international success, however. Last August, over two dozen representatives from the U.S. Congress pushed Secretary of State Antony Blinken to suspend export licenses for U.S. technology they argued was finding its way into the Turkish company’s drones.
- Some Ukrainian guy called its two newborn doberman puppies Javelin and Bayraktar. This nation❤️
- The proliferation of expendable UAVs in combat has the potential to disrupt the defense industry’s entire playing field, economically speaking, argued Andrew Milburn.
- The senior fellow with the Middle East Institute’s Defense and Security Program fears defense contractors are ill suited to develop countermeasures should such drones be deployed against American soldiers and believes a solution to the threat will only be solved in Silicon Valley rather than in the “cubicle warrens” of Lockheed Martin or Raytheon.
- “Despite its emergence as an inanimate hero of the Ukraine conflict, the story of the TB2, and its employment by various actors over the last three years, brings with it a dire warning for the U.S. military,” he wrote. “It is Turkey, with a defense budget a fraction of the U.S.’s, that has demonstrated how unmanned platforms changed the nature of modern war.”
