- Chu Yu-chen (朱玉宸), 26, aka 'Xiaoyu', and his assistant, Chuang Hsin-jui (莊炘睿), have been arrested for creating, selling and distributing over 100 porn videos of Taiwanese celebrities and politicians.
- According to Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau, the three made over NT$13 million in a past year by superimposing peoples' faces without their consent on to existing pornographic videos using deepfake technology.
- In addition to selling deepfakes of public figures on a series of Telegram groups, Chu is said to have accepted commissions to make deepfake videos of lesser-known individuals as a form of 'revenge porn.'
- In July 2022, Chu and Chuang were sentenced to five years and six months and three years and eight months in prison respectively for violations of Taiwan's Personal Data Protection Act. The sentences were commutable to fines.
- Another 21 victims filed civil lawsuits seeking financial compensation from Chu and Chuang for misuse of their likenesses.
- Politician Kao Chia-yu (高嘉瑜), also a victim, subsequently proposed to legislate deepfakes in Taiwan's national legislature via a bill that would make the production and spread of fake or manipulated images and video for profit a crime punishable by up to seven years in prison.
- The amendments to the Criminal Code include an additional article dedicated to a new form of crime using artificial intelligence — deepfakes — which involve inserting the likeness of a person into an existing image or video.
- The bill passed in January 2023.

- 你也許玩過換臉 App，試過將自己的臉換到明星身上。但你曾「被換臉」到色情片上嗎？
- 只要有心、有錢、有工具，人工智慧（AI）深度造假技術（Deepfake）現在能使意淫成真。本刊耗時半年，追蹤合成大量名人性愛片在網上販售、已擁有至少數千名付費會員的「台灣網紅挖面」帳號，發現這個「換臉生產鏈」運作的「玩法」多元，數月以來，不法獲利至少達新台幣數百萬。
- 在國外，不少知名女星都曾被挖面、做成A片，在台灣，至少已有百人受害，被害人大多礙於害怕被報復，選擇隱忍。本刊獨家專訪理科太太、白癡公主、球球、奎丁、黃捷、高嘉瑜等6名被換臉至色情片的被害人，說出她們遭挖面後的真實感受與證言。
- 人臉是如何被挖掉、又是如何幾可亂真地被接上他人的身體？「假的」影片，如何給被害人帶來「真實的」傷害？台灣法律為何拿這種行為沒轍？被害人還要等多久，才能恢復名譽、對惡行加以制裁？科技始終來自於人性，但人性裡的慾望會膨脹，在這個眼見不一定為憑的年代，科技制裁得了人性嗎？
- 經營YouTube頻道 5 年、23 歲的 YouTuber 球球收過上百封奇怪訊息。眼前這則，顯圖是「她」全身裸露的性愛影片。
- 這幾年球球人氣高漲，還曾被票選為「年度台男性幻想YouTuber」冠軍，她的頻道已有超過 31.5 萬人訂閱，熱門影片多達 50 萬人觀看。過去，她有時會收到網友訊息，告知她成為色情片騙流量的誘餌，但點進去後主角往往是別人，或激似她的日本女優。
- 她原是見怪不怪，但這回情況完全不一樣。2020 年底，粉絲傳來影片，詢問「這是不是妳？」只見影片中呻吟擺動的人，真的很像她。「好像，真的超像。」她當下全身僵硬，迅速關掉畫面。螢幕中女優的五官是她的五官，表情也十分神似，但她沒有去過畫面裡的那個地方，從房間背景、衣服、身材，甚至瀏海，都可以判斷不是她本人。
- 但是，她的臉怎麼會在那人的身上？
- 幾乎與此同時，YouTuber 奎丁也發現自己的合成性愛影片。由於外貌亮眼，奎丁曾被網友選為「最想一夜情的對象」冠軍。出於好奇心，她點開影片，逼自己要把影片看完，卻無法看超過幾秒鐘，深呼吸後，點開卻又再次暫停，噁心感從胃裡湧出，「有點像，又有點不太像，還有點怪怪的，比例不太對，我怎麼會講日文？」色情網站上，她驚見許多網紅朋友們也成了受害者。
- 她們的臉都被「偷」走了—更精確來說，她們的臉先遭人「挖」掉，然後被貼在不認識的人體影像上，最終成為不知名人士盈利販售的商品。
- 2020 年 10 月，大量網紅合成性愛影片開始在網上流傳。名為「台灣網紅挖面」的帳號在推特上提供眾多「AI 換臉」色情試看片，其利用 AI DeepfakeAI deep learning fake，人工智慧深度造假，又稱深度學習造假或深度偽造技術，將網紅的臉「移植」到色情片的 AV 女優身上。「商業模式」很簡單：製作方提供約 30 秒「試看片」作為宣傳，遍布色情網站、社群媒體，若要看完整版本，則須付費成為Telegram聊天群組會員，站方還會不定期提供各種「加值服務」。
- 這些幾可亂真的「試看片」在網上引起迴響，台灣網紅挖面在 2、3 個月內吸引近 6000 人成為會員。2020 年 12 月起，我們透過該群組成員邀請，進入 Telegram 上的網路社群，深入調查數月後發現，台灣網紅挖面不僅大量販售換臉色情片，也不定期販售素人或名人未經同意外流的性私密影像、素人遭迷姦偷拍影片。群組中被換臉、製成色情片的受害者將近百人，規模驚人，除了知名網紅、藝人明星，也包含不少女性政治人物。
- 多元「玩法」下潛藏著複雜的不法金流，真實犯罪所得令外人難以估計。我們將今年初遭「炸群」（解散群組）前的數個群組人數乘以入群「門檻」－－「N1 群組」炸群前共 5810 名成員，入群門檻為 400 元；「N2 群組」有 1591 名成員，入群門檻為 200 元；「防炸群」共 337 名成員，入群門檻為 200 元；「試看群」共 700 人，入群需繳 100 元—光是將前述數字相加，不法獲利就至少超過 277 萬元，這還不包含炸群後站方另起爐灶的群組獲利，亦不包含提供各種色情內容「加值服務」，以及每支喊價超過萬元的「客製集資大禮包」、「客製影片」等「高單價」不法所得。
- 該群組運作堪稱制度化，近半年來，對新進成員的篩選更趨謹慎。我們分批加入群組，其中一名記者近日詢問能否加入群組，站方卻反問：如何得知該群組？記者稱經由朋友介紹，站方立即要我們出示朋友的姓名、網路 ID，以便核實新進成員身分；甚至，為了確定我們是「自己人介紹的」，還要求出示友人曾交易過的「片名」。
- 一旦順利入群，除非問及「交易」，群主幾乎不私訊回應任何問題。經營「換臉群」對群主而言，貌似一門好生意－－違法的情色影片被稱為「資源」，這些「資源」不但可以賣，更能當「贈品」。
- 例如農曆過年前，群主發出「過年回饋」廣告，彼時雞排妹控訴翁立友性騷擾事件延燒，群組順勢推出「雞排妹大禮包買一送三」，除了主打長達近 52 分鐘的限定長片「商品」，另有中國裸貸事件裸貸為中國官方禁用的一款ＡＰＰ，透過自拍裸照與身分證件作為借款的抵押品，受害者多為少女的 75G 圖片和 248G 的「Ｎ禮包」—這則廣告隱晦地稱「N 禮包」為「敏感資源」，經檢視與比對，疑似為「韓國 N 號房」事件的違法外流影片。
- 他們口中的「交易」，貌似一樁樁滿足供需雙方的經濟行為，實則是共謀竊取他人肖像權與不法私密影片的犯罪行為。每一晚，群組裡彷彿舉辦一場又一場狂歡派對，站方雖然少與會員私下互動，卻透過制定明確遊戲規則、活潑玩法，建立了一個隱密卻活絡的社群空間。
- 想要成為具備買片資格的會員，入群基本費用為 400 元，繳交這筆錢後，會員可以花錢直購影片價格依長度及網紅知名度不同，從 50 元至 1000 元不等，例如近期推出「雞排妹 51 分鐘限定版」長片，要價 800 元。，或再加碼 400 元，可透過雲端硬碟觀看上近百支、平均每支 5 至 10 分鐘的「網紅換臉影片」。
- 站方除了在群組內固定更新影片，去年 11 月至 12 月期間，每週三舉行投票，由成員「提名」，票選「誰即將成為下個被換臉的對象」，平均每回約 500 人參與投票。
- 隔週，群主會在規則區放送集資公告，告知群友有哪些網紅集資成功將被製作成換臉片。站方也會不定期贈送「禮包」給會員。不過，「禮包」有時需付費，例如要價 800 元的「GD 大禮包」，允許使用者付費後在雲端空間觀看 120 支包含各類 A 片情節的合成影片，光是這個「禮包」內，就有超過 50 名女性公眾人物受害。
- 站方有時會開放「接單客製」，接受付費指定製作「素人換臉色情片」，或讓會員「集資競標」，競標單價甚至能達單筆萬元以上。他們的 Telegram 群中有群，各式小群組功能、費用不一，站方依使用者偏好進行分眾行銷，消費累計達 1500 元以上，更可進入「資深玩家 SVIP（Super Very Important Person）群」。
- 我們消費滿 1500 元，透過群主邀請，進入 SVIP 群組，這裡不僅可以觀看更長的挖面色情片，還提供資深的換臉愛好者競標，「標的物」是一支由得標者親自指定「換上誰的臉」的換臉影片，以及該影片的獨家擁有權。
- 凡參加競標，就可得到「參加獎」20GB 的 BDSM性愛虐待調教 影片，我們被加入後，看到「參加獎」的影片預覽顯示，一位頭戴粉紅蕾絲內褲的女性，正把自己的胸部打得通紅。
- 3 月 13 日晚上 8 點，消息一發布，群友們一一上線，開始進入表單留言，喊價的同時也標註想換臉的對象。
- 「小墨 1500」、「素人 kumi 希希 4500」、「（香港）主播羅鈺文 4100」、「陸子玄 13500」，隨著金額一路上飆，小墨的競標價來到 13600 元，眼看就要得標，半路殺出財力更厚者，以「素人 24000」得標。
- 此刻整個群組像是約好一般，不多問、不閒聊，得標者也不明講「素人是誰」。素人可能是得標者想意淫的網紅，也可能是鄰居、女朋友的朋友、告白失敗的對象、女同事，或是想報復的某個女人。在這裡，只要有錢、有足夠照片和影像，要把她或他製成任何影片都不是難事。
- 而在另一個以「deepnude（註：一款製作裸照的 AI 軟體，開發後被批評嚴重危害女性而遭快速下架）圖片交流」為主題的子群組裡，每到凌晨一點，就開始熱鬧的「意淫派對」。
- 我們在近期某個夜晚入群觀察，一名網友如常發問：「現在有人要一起意淫嗎？」另一人立刻響應：「線上有 158 人可以跟大大一起。」
- 只見許多人在此請求大神幫助，貼出一張又一張從臉書與 IG 抓下來的網美照，詢問：「有大大們對她有想法嗎？」有人在此徵求影片互換，一人另開話題：「想交流前女友影片的可以私我。」沒過多久，立刻有人說和女友出去玩，傳來一張在旅館房間的裸照。
- 他們也交流技術，有人分享製作「顏射圖網站」，詢問如何做出「讓女人被顏射到滿臉洨很真實」的照片？這時立刻有專業人士回應，講解如何調整色彩平衡與不透明度，緊接著，有人現學現賣，貼出自己的情侶照，照片裡的女友成了「被顏射」版本。
- 觀察群組成員對話，不乏公開的討價還價。其中一個子群組裡，曾有群組成員想付費卻嫌貴，詢問一分鐘付多少錢才算合理？
- 一名自稱製作者的人士回應，算起製作成本與技術細節，製作一分鐘的影片，首先要準備 1320 張圖，再耗時 15 到 20 分鐘為影片進行「手動調整」，加上電費、模型費、蒐集影像資料，最後定價 1 分鐘 100 元。
- 這名詢價者顧左右而言他，表示喜愛的片子「片段不能太碎、動作不能太單一。」製作者反問：「那你要下我的單嗎？」詢價者答：「先不要。」製作者嘗試提供幾個知名網紅、名模名單，希望詢價者從中挑選付費，最後並未成交。
- 一名試圖兜售我們影片、與我們對話的影片製作者，更在言談間透露，他拜了其中一名影片製作者為師，並透露製作挖面影片不需工程或資訊相關背景，只要顯示卡和 CPU 等電腦硬體設備夠好，花上半年時間訓練，就有能力接單販售，「這跟美術天分比較有關，因為要選Ａ片跟臉型。」
- 目前，他的技術可在一週內完成 2 支片，他強調要將臉型修到「像」又細緻，很花時間，並稱：「要真的很有愛耶。」
- 除了詢價、議價，我們也曾目睹成員之間的爭執。
- 去年底，該群組的部分資訊外洩，群裡有人怒罵，有人想抓內鬼，有成員呼籲：「影片私下交流就好，何必流竄到外面。」原來，不少人在此購買影片後，就當成「情色資本」，不但將影片「外流」、與他人交換，也有人拿到其他色情網站上作為籌碼，交換更多影片。
- 1 月 5 日，群主發公告表示被外界盯上，立刻發動炸群，2 個超過 4000 人的聊天群與內容一夕消失。這樣的動作目的在湮滅犯罪證據—表面上，看似避風頭，其實很快就另開新群，讓付費者重新加入。事實上，在網際網路上，這樣的「轉移陣地」，風險較低，貌似無痛，且不需耗費成本。群主炸群後，我們很快被加入新的群組，成員至今超過 3000 人。
- 至於「台灣網紅挖面」到底是誰？我們無法確認。「他」慎言慎行，我們甚至無法進一步和他對話、確知其團隊大小。頻道早期開放聊天，會員多以暱稱示人，有人直接換上網紅大頭貼，表明是色情小帳號。夜深了，聊天室更熱絡，幾百人在線，除了交流，也會抓內鬼、抓「外流仔」指將挖面影片外流者。
- 但他們多數未意識到自己正從事嚴重犯罪。有人無辜地說：「說真的，我們這群都還算是紳士，頂多自己尻尻。」也有人說，「我們是學術交流。」有時他們也討論倫理問題，群組裡不乏有人自承「我們有些人真沒法控制自己想看啥，壓制不住自己的欲望」，但隨即又給自己找台階下，「但我們絕對沒有想過要去『故意』傷害（被挖面的）本人。」
- 今年初，我們與多名受害網紅及政治人物聯繫、進行專訪。此前，網紅中只有奎丁及白癡公主曾公開談論此事。詢問過程中，我們得知許多受害者都知道自己被「換臉」至色情片盈利，但因擔心遭受報復，多數人僅能裝作沒這一回事。
- 沒說出口，不代表痛苦不存在。採訪當天，YouTuber 球球卸下招牌笑容，「我平常都是發美食 Vlog，不太談嚴肅的話題，要談（挖面）這件事情，跟我的螢幕形象不符合，但我一直很想說。我想面對這件事情，想把握機會講出來。」
- 一開始，她只是感到不舒服。網路上有人覺得，影片是假的，「應該還好吧？」但球球最終發現，對被害人來說，世上沒有「還好」這件事。親近的人，她也許可以解釋「這不是我」，但其他人呢？訪談不到 10 分鐘，她眼淚大滴大滴落下。
- 情況愈來愈糟。遭到挖面之後，接連好幾個網友問她：「球球妳為什麼拍這種東西？」她也僅能解釋，自己沒拍色情影片，此事已經交給經紀公司處理。她主動避開與性有關的所有新聞，「連現在想起來我都覺得很不舒服，形象要建立起來是一件很困難的事，可是一部影片就把我毀掉了。」
- 網紅身分是兩面刃，伴隨名氣而來的還有惡意。去年中，她經歷一起網路死亡威脅，對方揚言要將她分屍。報案時警方告訴她，犯罪發生在網路，很難查，別抱持希望。
- 死亡威脅後不過數月，就發生換臉事件，她害怕報案的結果也一樣，恐懼加上心灰意冷，不再尋求警方介入。其實她的父親就是警察，「我也有跟爸爸說這件事，爸爸跟我說：『對不起，我們也沒有辦法。』」
- 先遭威脅、又無端被換臉做成 A 片，兩件事加起來，把她的精神狀況逼到極限，近一年她陷入憂鬱，焦慮失眠，也傷害自己，曾在枕頭下放美工刀，醒來卻沒有印象。
- 「吃藥很想吐，不吃藥也很想吐，過了一段滿低潮的時期，但我的工作就是拍影片，還是要對鏡頭講話、表現得很開心…」YouTube 頻道上的她依舊到處吃喝玩樂，但離開鏡頭，在精神科醫師面前崩潰大哭，「醫生說不是我的錯，可是我很混亂，明明不是我，為什麼是我遇到這種事情？是不是我不要當 YouTuber 就好了？還是我做錯什麼？要被這樣對待？」球球哽咽說，她至今沒看完那支片，也不願再看到。
- 在我們接觸的受害人之中，奎丁是極少數看完自己遭 AI 挖面合成的色情片、並且正面還擊者。「看完影片後有點傷心，又有點難過，自己好像是受害者，又不知道要怎麼說？又不是我的（私密）影片外流？」奎丁思考許久，仍找不出適合的詞彙去形容看完影片的感覺，「可是，我的臉在上面，我不知道要怎麼形容這個感覺，太難形容了，無法言喻。」
- 2020 年 11 月初，奎丁發現自己被換臉後，便滲入台灣網紅挖面群組，蒐證後製作影片，向公眾揭發群組實況。事後沒幾天，她便遭到更嚴厲的報復－－該群組中的會員紛紛將帳戶大頭照與暱稱改為「奎丁」，而站方不但將奎丁的「完整版影片」加倍露出宣傳，又陸續上架二支奎丁的換臉片，報復意味明顯。
- 「我那影片有 23 萬流量，每個人進群，（不法獲利）多少錢？」肖像被盜用盈利，奎丁諮詢律師該如何解決？但律師提醒她，此案雖能訴諸《刑法》妨害名譽罪及妨害風化罪，但因為對方可能使用浮動 IP，難以追查，加上影片是在國外網站流通，社群平台未必配合檢警調查，很難制裁犯罪者。
- 奎丁強調：「我想教育觀眾，不要再去看這樣子的影片了。你可以幻想、在你的腦袋裡面組織，但請不要把它做出來、上網拿去賣，這對女生一定有傷害。」
- 擁有 153 萬訂閱數的 YouTuber 白癡公主曾遭盜用肖像，當粉絲告知她遭人挖面做成 A 片上傳色情網站 Pornhub，她選擇的應對方式是截圖上傳至個人 Instagram，以詼諧方式澄清：「我竟然會上 Pornhub，也太好笑了吧 …如果我有這種身材，我每天看鏡子一小時。」但她同時也求助：「要告還是要報警呢？」
- 「身為半個公眾人物，我要讓大家知道這不是一件好事、不值得讓大家理所當然去看這種影片，或去做這種消費。」
- 被挖面後，陸續有人來安慰她，「網友跟我說：『其實不是只有妳受害喔，很多人也有受害。』但是這句話有點像是說：『啊，妳又不是一個人受害，有什麼好在乎的？』」
- 這些留言真的是在安慰她嗎？白癡公主有點疑惑。她明白需謹慎評估應對方式，求助律師，律師說台灣有相關法律，卻管不到這種新興的挖面手法，「蠻諷刺的…我問律師影片有辦法下架嗎？律師說可能可以，但網站 IP 設在國外…我問那怎麼辦？是請人家下架影片就沒事了嗎？如果是一般民眾被這樣做、被陷害，也是下架就沒事嗎？如果流出去呢？如果有人備份呢？」
- 「如果未來真的做了一部身形很像我的 A 片，我到底要怎麼反駁？」如果、如果、如果，每一種如果的背後都是恐懼，她試想：「如果連我家人都不信，如果網友不相信，我該怎麼辦？如果我站出來講，有人會相信我嗎？要用聲音來判別嗎？要用場景來判別嗎？我要跟人家說『這Ａ片的場景不是我家』嗎？我要把原始Ａ片的番號查出來，跟大家說這是哪部片、身體本來是哪個女優嗎？」她又想，但如果今天被挖面，臉被合成到不知名的影片和素人身上呢？那受害者能怎麼辦？
- 深假技術讓過去只能發生在腦中的意淫成「真」，但伴隨而來的，卻是穿過虛擬世界，對當事人的真實暴力。
- 事實上，換臉色情片正成為新型態的數位性暴力犯罪，遍及世界各地。運用深假技術於色情影片，最早出現於 2017 年（這比深假技術運用於資訊戰來得更早），一名 Reddit 使用者，代號 Deepfakes 創立子論壇「deepfakes」，開始張貼利用 AI 技術偽造的好萊塢女星色情片。
- 2020出版的《深度造假》書中寫道，代號 Deepfakes 的匿名人士受訪時曾說，自己只是「對機器學習感興趣的人，」發現了一種「聰明的方法」，利用開源 AI 工具，將名人的臉「置換」到色情片明星身體上。
- 他創造的科技怪物很快席捲了網路世界。雖然該論壇最終被 Reddit 下架，但他利用開放原始碼製作、公開分享技術，已使越來越多人掌握此項技術，協助他人製作的換臉工具和免費軟體廣為流傳，如今，無需工程背景，任何人都可以獨立製作合成影片。
- 2020 年，全球前四大深度造假色情網站的瀏覽次數已超過一億三千四百萬次。根據荷蘭網路安全新創公司 DeepTrace Lab（現更名為Sensity AI） 2019 年的研究報告《Deepfake現狀：前景、威脅與影響》，全世界深假影片有 1 萬 4678 部，此數字在 7 個月內增加了 2 倍，並預言將持續大幅成長。深假色情片不僅觀看數量驚人，9 成以上受害者為女性。
- 長期研究性別暴力議題的政大傳播學院副教授方念萱指出，雖然目前性犯罪受害人男性愈來愈多，但換臉色情片仍以女性為受害者大宗，換臉色情片也成為報復女性公眾人物、前女友的一種手段，「對於女性人物，她如果好發議論，這是一個可以阻絕她們講話的方式。」
- 方念萱曾進行性私密影像外流的研究，受害人因影片外流、遭性勒索，受創程度超乎想像。挖面影片受害者無法證實影片為假，並感受真實暴力與羞辱，「大部分時候我們都說不是真的，可是那個傷害、恐懼，是很真實的，恐懼就可以噤聲一個人。」
- 恐懼可能噤聲任何人，即使被害人是公眾人物，擁有一定的影響力、話語權，也可能莫名其妙深陷其中。高雄市議員黃捷也是受害者之一。我們經黃捷同意，播影片給她看，幾秒後，她面無表情關掉視窗，乾笑幾聲說：「其實還是有一定的相似度…不像本人講話，這個臉…呵呵，但跟真人比對一下還是有落差。」
- 黃捷不是第一次遭遇性犯罪，她的臉書常常收到猥褻照或言語騷擾，但遭遇此事，她仍有些激動，「怎麼連這種新的技術、新型的犯罪型態，也有我的份？到底要深受其害到什麼時候？」
- 台灣網紅挖面群組中販售的換臉色情片，不乏外貌出眾的年輕女性政治人物，同時也有社經文化地位較高、年紀較長的名女人。例如，去年底，開始有會員鼓譟：「臉蛋不是重點。」、「身為總統拿來性幻想真的棒。」腦筋甚至動到國家元首身上。
- 將權力較大或社會地位較高的女性製作成挖面影片，是基於何種心態？「這是另外一種程度的羞辱，類似的想法是：『妳變成 AV 女優囉，妳再跩呀！』」台灣成人影片評論家及專欄作者一劍浣春秋嘗試分析製作者心態：「這些（被害）人平常的形象可能比較冷或高傲，例如之前台北市長選舉時，有個男優很壯很高，就有人說他像連勝文，我覺得是相同的心態，我討厭你，我就做這種東西來羞辱你。」
- 我們也在台灣網紅挖面子群組 deepnude 群裡見到這一幕：有人分享惡搞合成藝人蔡依林的 Uber Eats 廣告成為「Uber Sex」，製作者並稱「想做蔡依林很久了，剛好有素材。」一劍浣春秋分析：「我覺得這是父權思想，（影片製作者覺得）女人就是這樣子，我要按她的頭。」
- 「這很明顯就是一個羞辱，隱含的意思是，女性本來就是要被觀看的，有滿滿的父權的視角，更何況，特別找這些有一定社會聲望、可以跟男性平起平坐的女性，當作惡搞對象，更是一種踐踏，要狠狠把你踩在腳下，」黃捷氣憤說，「有一種凌駕於女性之上的快感吧？」
- 「他們 10 幾分鐘內就可以假冒你、發布假的影片、假訊息就更防不勝防，現在大家打擊假新聞已經很辛苦了，更何況未來是用這麼真的東西（影片）...。」 除了對女性的羞辱，黃捷也預想過可能更糟的情況：「我在政治圈，未來要選舉，如果所有的人都用這種方式帶風向，會很恐怖。」
- 身為當事人，她思考走法律途徑，「但我要怎麼吿？我發現超難告的，偵查的時候可能找不到犯罪者、找不到源頭，因為（影片）可能已轉了好幾手，你連要告誰可能都不知道，這是被全世界霸凌的感覺。」黃捷乾笑幾聲說，「我們有點像是性侵的受害者吧，我知道我被欺負了，但是我要講出來的時候，要面對社會的眼光、還要去證明這件事情、過程困難重重。」
- 她也有和所有受害者相似的顧慮，她坦言：「就是在糾結跟害怕。」
- 同為知名女性政治人物，立法委員高嘉瑜也是受害者。不肖人士直接以「公主頭女優很少」、「特殊劇情」作為廣告詞，意圖藉此招徠買氣。「我們的照片資料要取得非常容易，要偽造我們的影片也很容易，大量傳播對我們的名譽會造成很大的傷害，對女性的傷害非常大。」高嘉瑜指出，「不管（影片製作者）是要展現某種程度上的權力，物化在政治上、社會上比較有影響力的女性，或是他想展現男性對女性的侵犯，都是一種性暴力。」
- 我們也經她同意、出示影片給她看，她試著幽默回應「不像，」但接著說：
- 「不只名人，一般人也會受害。」高嘉瑜強調，政府應有相關法令防範，「目前國外有立法規範，例如影片如果變造，應該要註明，否則就會有相關刑罰。」她表示，針對 AI 倫理使用的指引，未來希望提出修法，「針對變造、偽造、新的科技模式，對這些影片做出防範。」
- 「這當然是一種犯罪。」刑事局科技犯罪防制中心主任林建隆指出，若有「台灣網紅挖面」的受害當事人提告或檢舉，刑事局會介入調查。但他也說，該群組主要活動於Telegram，確有偵查困難，「我們跟 Telegram 沒有正式聯繫管道，調閱資料方面確實是遭遇一些困難，當初他們（Telegram）成立的宗旨就是宣稱保密，很多國家執法機關也不容易向他們取得資料。」
- 「所有網路犯罪都有隱匿性、匿蹤性、跨境問題，但凡走過必留痕跡，他們總是需要上網，需要跳板，透過跨境方式一層一層往上追，透過跨國主管機關合作、跟境外調資料，還是有機會。」林建隆強調，警方能透過資訊流或金流等面向來做追查，並非絕對抓不到人、無法制裁。
- 然而，即使抓到人了，影片可能還在網上流通，移除影像實則困難。iWIN 網路內容防護機構執行祕書劉昱君指出，至今還沒有換臉色情片受害人向 iWIN 尋求協助，但他們目前能做的，也僅能聯繫平台，要求其遵守自律守則下架影片，沒有強制力。
- 新型態性暴力犯罪層出不窮，國家法規沒跟上，只會讓受害人求助無門、受盡折磨。近年，性私密影像外流的議題嚴重且受到重視，立法院也正討論將以專法處理。但「不是真的」、「遭換臉」的性影像該如何防治？至今仍缺乏討論。
- 現有資訊顯示，在台灣，目前未有任何深假技術的受害者提告。數位女力聯盟理事長、律師朱芳君解釋，多數被害人擔心事情鬧大、遭受報復，要挺身而出需要極大勇氣。
- 朱芳君強調，無論是將網紅換臉至色情片、或是散佈分享該影片，都已經觸犯《刑法》。受害人可依《刑法》第 310 條妨害名譽罪提告，最多可處兩年以下有期徒刑；散佈影色情片，則涉及《刑法》第 235 條散佈猥褻物品罪。另外，受害人也可依《民法》求償，因名譽、肖像遭受侵害，提起精神上的損害賠償，「深假技術案件是新興類型，我們希望未來的司法案例裁判結果，能適當反映加害人惡行，」她說。
- 對於目前盛行的換臉色情犯罪，政務委員、行政院發言人羅秉成指出，換臉色情類屬行政院定義的網路性別暴力範疇行政院 2021 年 2 月公告的數位／網路性別暴力內涵為：「透過網路或數位方式，基於性別之暴力行為。即針對性別而施加他人之暴力或不成比例地影 響他人，包括身體、心理或性之傷害、痛苦、施加威脅、壓制和剝奪其他行動自由等。」並分成以下十種類型：1. 網路跟蹤 2. 惡意或未經同意散布與性/性別有關個人私密資料 3. 網路性騷擾 4. 基於性別貶抑或仇恨之言論或行為  5. 性勒索 6. 人肉搜索 7. 基於性別偏見所為之強暴與死亡威脅 8. 招募引誘 9. 非法侵入或竊取他人資料 10. 偽造或冒用身分，目前確實法制不足，「《妨害名譽罪》是相對輕罪，但網路危害所產生的影響是持續性的，可能一輩子，所以有人稱為『數位刺青』，用舊的條文處理新的犯罪現象，現在看來是罪責顯不相當。」他並表示，未來立法原則「從重從嚴」。
- 羅秉成表示，已經要求法務部針對多種類型的網路性別暴力重新盤點法規，若立新法防治換臉色情，將至少會是公訴罪，強化國家介入，「早年強姦罪，就是告訴乃論，結果很多當事人和解、息事寧人，所以無法真正抑制性侵害行為，改為公訴罪，就是政策選擇。」若不立新法，也可以修《刑法》或《性侵害防治法》，「我們觀念要開始改變，性侵害這件事，不是只有實體世界肉體上的性侵害，可能是網路上的性侵害。」
- 羅秉成認為，全面性的修法盤點是較可行的方向，也能同時處理影像下架機制，「像是《性侵害防制法》本身就有保護機制，現在衛福部也在研究，移除下架的（法源）機制就能在這裡處理，」但他同時坦言：「我們現在只能依《兒少性剝削條例》處理兒少性私密影像，但是 Deepfake 被侵害的不只女孩，婦女也是受害者。」
- 但修法何時完成？羅秉成語帶保留，「當然是越快越好，但法案要經過部會仔細的盤點跟檢討，」他坦言，「要政府拿出一個單一藥方的萬靈丹，可以講是沒有，不是台灣沒有，是大家都沒有。面臨網路世界，大家有點措手不及，它發展得太快了、一直變化，這種變化前提下，要用法律去追，是很難追的。」目前他也要求教育部加強推廣媒體識讀，衛福部進行相關國內外調查，作為政策參考。
- 一劍浣春秋認為，在「換臉」深度造假領域，台灣的技術發展相比日本與韓國更為蓬勃發展，原因在於日本與韓國有合法的情色產業，台灣沒有。他透露，在 2018 到 2019 年間，陸續有不同團隊找他討論「AI 合成色情影片」的商業化可能性，其中幾位工程師任職於內湖科學園區。
- 一劍浣春秋拒絕了對方的邀請。他回憶，當時對方除了找他討論 AI 換臉技術，還表示希望涉足 AV 的即時翻譯，以及愛看 AV 的人都希望的「馬賽克消除」技術－－當紅女優三上悠亞曾在IG表示，網路流傳的無碼影片乃是AI合成偽造，並非破解原始影片而來。一劍浣春秋指出：「把有碼片變成無碼片，他們對外叫破解馬賽克，其實不是，他們應該是利用AI技術，把馬賽克後面的畫面依據線索描繪出來...。」
- 我們將站方強力宣傳稱「中文＋高清＋臉部貼合度極好」的〈雞排妹限定版超完整〉影片交給一劍浣春秋過目，他直呼逼真、幾乎找不到瑕疵。他指出，該片原作應為日本片商 FALENO 的新人沙月惠奈，「沙月惠奈跟鄭家純雞排妹在條件上蠻像的，皮膚都很白，兩人身材接近。」
- 他解釋：「這些背後的業者，不但對合成技術瞭若指掌，對 AV 資訊掌握透徹，還找得到匹配的人選...」過去，韓國女團 TWICE 台灣籍成員周子瑜也曾被換臉在 AV 女優美竹鈴的身體上，因二人身材相近。
- 「你看這些東西的時候，人類最幽暗的本性都出來了...，」一劍浣春秋舉例，日本 AV 片型「激似系列」，能滿足男人的意淫，例如波多野結衣就因神似林志玲而在台灣走紅，男人靠 AV 意淫；而如果被意淫的對象不拍 AV，現在有換臉影片。
- 「現在有個方法讓你不必意淫偶像，直接看偶像的臉，用別的肉體來演 A 片，這讓對偶像有性幻想的人來說是很大的誘惑。」他也舉例，日本偶像三上悠亞出道轉投入 AV，獲得高人氣，這說明情色產業的核心價值：「簡單講就是把女性徹底物化，就是男性生理上與心理上的占有。」
- 「這些（被換臉的）苦主都有名，再來，背後做這些影片的人，對 AV 很瞭解，你不會看到雞排妹的頭被接在 80 公斤的人的身體上。你看了會有：『她真的拍了嗎？』的想法。」一劍浣春秋指出，網路特性造成這類影片容易被瘋傳：「網路愈方便，人思考的空間會愈來愈少，很多人看了（深度造假影片）是會深信不疑的。」
- 「我覺得真的好像《黑鏡》...，」同為挖面受害者的 YouTuber 理科太太受訪時數度提及科幻影集《黑鏡》，「科技今天發展到這邊了，會怎麼被人類誤用？會有可能帶來什麼樣的後果？」
- 理科太太是經由記者告知，才知自己也受害。她冷靜看完「台灣網紅挖面」做的影片，放大看瑕疵，淡淡說：「這個臉沒有截好。」我們難以判讀她的情緒，她又傳給老公看，老公回她：「怎麼會有人要做這個？」
- 理科太太嘗試理解販售、製作、交流這些影片者的心態：「這些人為什麼要在一個秘密的群組裡面講？他們心中應該也不覺得這是見得了光的事。如果今天是實名制，大家知道你是誰，你不敢在臉書上說，『我想做什麼，就做什麼。』」《黑鏡》刻畫的人性，大多不甚光明；她還是想和社會溝通：
- 理科太太說，身而為人，希望未來不限犯罪型態，法律可以跟得上所有新興科技，「以後一定會有各種科技問題，要去增加條款。我由衷的希望（法律）可以跟得上（犯罪行為）。」
- 「希望有一天，不只是法律有辦法追上這個（深假技術犯罪行為），其他個科技也有辦法追上。科技可以讓我們一掃（影片）就知道：這個是做出來的。」她想像過一些反制的可能性，若能成真，那被害人就不用擔心受怕，「要是別人說你拍了個 A 片，我就有另一個科技告訴你：這個真的不是我。」
- 也許在未來，科技真的可以協助被害人告知大眾：「她真的不是我。」
- 深度學習技術被濫用的同時，台灣亦開始有團隊投入偵測深假影片的技術。成功大學數據科學研究所助理教授許志仲團隊二年即前投入研究，希望能有效「以 AI 對抗 AI」，目前團隊已開發出一套偵測工具，其系統以 0.5 作為分界，偵測數值若高於 0.5，則可能為深假影片；愈趨近於 1，為偽造影像的可能性愈高。
- 例如，網路上瘋傳的「英國女王跳舞」、「歐巴馬罵川普笨蛋」等影片，已被證實為假，以這套工具測出的數值皆高達 0.7；而先前網傳川普承認選舉結果的影片為造假，台灣事實查核中心請許志仲協助偵測，數值為 0.4，顯示川普承認敗選影片為真，終止了流言。
- 我們請許志仲團隊協助偵測站方去年起放在網路上、解析度與合成品質較低的影片，測出的數值大多超越 0.8，顯然為假。我們再請團隊協助偵測近日站方狂打廣告的〈雞排妹限定版超完整〉影片，該片稍早被一劍浣春秋評論為「真假難辨」。結果顯示，不同畫面的數值差異慎大，介於 0.2 至 0.7 不等，我們隨機截取 6 分鐘影片，測出的平均分數為 0.62，許志仲解釋：「這顯示有 6 成 2 的機率是偽造的。」
- 連精密的偵測工具也有難辨真假的時候。「有些深假影片『很狡猾』...，」許志仲觀察，某些製作者會將影片做後製，故意降低解析度、 意圖使畫面模糊，或刻意添加雜訊，這些都會干擾偵測。研究團隊認為，目前較簡易可行的應對的方式是，降低偵測門檻，就連偵測值未達、但趨近於 0.5 的影像，也加以留意。
- 目前，這套偵測系統只在學術界使用，尚未包裝成 APP 形式。他舉例，未來若實際應用於社群網站，若不肖人士在臉書發布偽造影片，系統就能在 po 文時做初步審核，若抓到「可能有偽造成分」者，就先暫緩發布，「有（深度偽造）嫌疑的發文，就做第二次審核，暫時不要讓它流出去。」
- 但若真的這樣做，又可能涉及侵犯隱私與否的兩難，許志仲說：「我們研發技術當然希望有人去用，但怎麼採用，才是最好的策略？我們去偵測，勢必要掌握資訊的流向，但是大家又會重視隱私的問題，所以可能又涉及隱私流向。」他舉例，若偵測出偽造內容，藉此作出內容的阻斷，「但如果這個阻斷出錯了，會不會影響其他人的權益？」
- 「兩邊（深假影片製造端、偵測端）的技術確實在競爭，可是，確實是失衡的狀態...，」許志仲說，可預見的未來，深度造假影片的製造與偵測的技術，都將各自發展。
- 目前，辨識造假影片仍有些方法。「大部分造假影片的五官都很漂亮、做得很逼真，反而是輪廓和背景交界處，才比較容易出問題，臉部和頭髮部分的交界處，容易出現這種瑕疵。」許志仲指出，國內外學界有各種偵測偽造影片的方式，除了觀察五官與輪廓特徵，也有學者測試影像中「左右臉光源是否一致」、「亮度和光源角度和背景不一樣」，甚至有國外學術界嘗試以高階血氧儀去測試「臉部是否有心跳」，用來偵測影片真假。另有不少學者都發現，深度造假影片裡的人臉無法眨眼睛。
- 事實上，目前的深假技術已經可使偽造影像「眨眼睛」了。許志仲坦言：「每個觀察到的（瑕疵）可能都只出現於特定時間點，例如過了半年、一年，新技術出來，同樣的標準就不見得可以測出真偽了。」無獨有偶，理科太太也在受訪時向我們強調：「他們（深假影像）遲早會讓人眨眼睛的！」
- 打假困境難解，中研院「聽其言觀其行閱其文」團隊去年起延攬聲音、影像、文字訊息偵測專家，希望研究出偵測假訊息的工具包。這項計畫的總主持人王新民說：「這種事情（造假、打假）是道高一尺，魔高一丈，兩邊互相競爭，我們覺得比較可行的是開發各種假資訊偵測的工具包，希望能夠逐步做出來。」
- 他舉例，未來若有造假影像，工具包也許能結合影像檢索，查出原始來源。目前，他們與台灣事實查核中心合作，未來也希望有機會與相關單位合作，提高鑑識人員的工作效率。
- 只是，王新民也坦言：「造假技術愈厲害，就表示我們偵測技術一定也會跟著愈來愈厲害，但真的要做到全自動（偵測），我覺得可能不太容易。」他如此看待正邪兩方的鬥爭：「我其實不覺得哪天我們偵測造假技術會完勝造假。人類社會就是這樣。」
- 這個團隊成員皆同意，未來有心人士想做深度造假影片，成本只會更低、破綻只會更少。中央大學資訊工程學系教授蔡宗翰指出，目前的影片製作者不需來自研發單位或科技公司，「顯（示）卡進步得非常快，只要（顯卡的）算力（運算資源）一直進步，變造出來的影片就會愈來愈精緻。」會擔心偵測技術難以追上造假技術嗎？蔡宗翰說：「不會啦，只要國家給我們夠多資源，希望我們的偵測端比他們強...。」
- 除了科技、法律，另一種制裁假影片方式，或許還得靠群眾力量。「我們可以做一個網站，大家如果發現有造假（影片），就回報上去。」中研院資訊科技創新研究中心研究員兼副主任曹昱說，未來可研擬成立平台，以類似陌生來電辨識軟體「Whoscall」的形式，系統接獲回報，就可立刻介入，分析並宣佈影片真假。
- 「目前除了 AI 技術，大家也在討論邊緣運算。其實，這就是把 AI 模型的 model 輕量化，」團隊成員之一、台科大人工智慧研究中心主任花凱龍補充，若硬體成功被輕量化，未來要做造假影片勢必更容易，「硬體不再需要很貴的電腦，只需要一個手機的電腦就可以來做變造這件事情...也許你的手機，未來就可以直接做這些變造。」
- 今年四月，我們發現群組裡持續產出「新商品」，新增一批小名氣的網紅被製作成影片，滿足群友先前提出「希望有完整做愛橋段」的需求。
- 其中，有這樣一則訊息：日本藝人阿部瑪麗亞的換臉影片，並非透過高效能電腦運算製作，而是使用手機製作。4 月 10 日，群主發布廣告：「盜臉駭客－－手機換臉中文版開賣」， 這項服務計有「基礎」、「高階」、「精緻」等三種「套餐」，要價新台幣 1500 元至 3000 元不等，宣稱因大量群友希望能以手機製作換臉影片，因此研發出「不需要電腦知識也可輕鬆用手機換臉的軟體」，並稱已做出「素人的實測效果影片」。
- 幾天後，一名群組成員丟出想製作成 A 片的「素人朋友」正面照，另一人回應：「來練習一下手機版換臉」；又有一人搭腔：「我朋友有買（手機換臉軟體），蠻好用的。」截稿前夕，站方向我們兜售這套手機版換臉軟體，強調有「詳細中文教學」、以及完善的「售後服務」。
- 未來已來。我們這才想起花凱龍受訪時的提醒－－那則預言，不過早於「手機換臉中文版」廣告上架前的 40 小時。

- 網紅奎丁曾出面控訴遭Telegram群組「台灣網紅挖面」換臉變成謎片女主角，影片在數千人的群組內販售，被「偷臉」的包括最近話題人物脫口秀演員龍龍、網紅白癡公主、奎丁、蕾拉，以及正妹民代黃捷、高嘉瑜等人，警方接獲檢舉後成立專案小組追查，赫然發現該群組藏鏡人竟是剛宣布引退的百萬YouTuber（YT）小玉（26歲），今日上午上門逮人。
- 
- ▲有6千個成員的不法群組利用AI技術「偷臉」女網紅和名人，合成謎片販售，警方查出百萬YouTuber小玉就是主嫌。（示意圖／CTWANT提供）
- 據了解，警方是根據「台灣網紅挖面」群組的金流向上追查，發現該群組帳戶為朱玉宸所有，而朱男就是百萬YouTuber小玉。警方估計，小玉和公司員工等3人涉嫌以Deep Fake軟體偷臉名人，並製作影片銷售，不法所得至少有500萬元以上。

- ▲人氣網紅奎丁去年10月曾拍攝影片指控遭「台灣網紅挖面」偷臉，藉此澄清並捍衛權益，警方循線成立專案小組追查。（圖／翻攝自奎丁YouTuber頻道）。
- 本刊調查，小玉今年4月21月宣布引退，疑似就是找到「賺錢門道」才轉低調從事幕後工作。其實，去年4月1號愚人節，小玉曾上傳名為「韓X瑜毀謗我的錄影存證」KUSO影片，小玉就曾以AI軟體偷臉韓國瑜，他自述是以人民幣1500元買下 Deep Fake軟體來合成影片，告訴網友「眼見不一定為憑」，更藉此打擊假新聞，當時還獲得廣大正面迴響，未料小玉後來竟以此軟體走偏門大撈「換臉」財。
- 以「AV女優換臉」打出名號的「台灣網紅挖面」私密群組是會員制，入會費400元，會員可訂製或競標製作色情謎片，該「客製化」服務收費從300到3000元不等，而該群組的吸客方式是，先在推特上提供「AI換臉」色情試看片作為廣告，接著在警方較難追查的Telegram上開設群組，目前成員約有6千人。
- 
- ▲小玉在去年愚人節曾以AI換臉技術「Deep Fake」自製韓國瑜篇影片，提醒民眾防範「假新聞」，未料他竟藉此撈金。（示意圖／CTWANT提供）
- 該群組利用AI軟體 「Deep Fake」將網紅或名人臉部移植到色情片AV女優上，此種「換臉」科技的完成度極高，很容易以假亂真。網紅奎丁去年10月間出面捍衛自身權益，曝光該不法群組後，業者不僅未下架影片，反而下猛藥加倍宣傳奎丁的合成影片，甚至陸續上架新片，群組成員也紛紛將暱稱或大頭照更改為奎丁，頗具報復性。

- THE ISSUE OF “deepfakes” has been widely discussed in Taiwan after YouTuber “Xiao Yu” was found to be responsible for a Telegram group used to sell, commission, and circulate “deepfake” porn videos of women, who were mostly public figures. Xiao Yu, whose real name is Zhu Yu-chen, was subsequently taken into custody. Xiao Yu is primarily known for humor videos, though some of his viral stunts have caused controversy in the past.
- The public response to the incident was large enough that no less than President Tsai Ing-wen would comment on the matter, drawing attention to the issue of deepfakes with a post on her Facebook. The Telegram group was previously detailed by an investigative report from Mirror Media that was originally released in May, which became widely circulated again after the arrest came to light.
- 
- In particular, the group operated by combining the faces of women with porn actresses in adult videos. This includes public figures such as influencers Mrs. Science, Zamy Ding, and female politicians including Kao Chia-yu and Huang Jie. Members of the group could vote on their choice of the next public figure to make adult videos using the faces of, or commission the group to make videos of certain individuals, so long as there were enough photographs to use as material for the deepfake video. For some, this included individuals trying to make “revenge porn” videos of exes, or even their current partners.
- Between four different groups that formed the network, there were around 8,000 users, who would pay an entrance fee of between 100 NT and 400 NT to join. As a result, the group would have generated at least 2,779,600 NT in income.
- The report interviewed legal and cybersecurity experts regarding deepfakes, with minister without portfolio and Executive Yuan spokesperson Lo Bing-cheng pointing to how existing laws lag behind the development of technology, with punishments for deepfakes remaining relatively light, and notions of sexual violence or harassment failing remaining having failed to adapt to digital technology. Likewise, cybersecurity experts pointed to how deepfake technology was advancing, making it harder to distinguish between deepfakes and real videos, and that producing deepfakes would likely become easier in the future through apps. The report also suggested that compared to other countries in the region, deepfake technology was relatively advanced in Taiwan.
- To this extent, the report also interviewed women who deepfake videos had been made of and how they felt about it. Many of those interviewed discussed feelings of discomfort, in not knowing if individuals they met had watched the video, as well as how this would be used to target them publicly, to affect their images. For example, after the release of such a video, some individuals discussed not knowing whether to issue a public disavowal, since this would draw more attention to the video.
- Last year in October, influencer Zamy Ding released a video about having discovered a deepfake video of herself and entered the group used for distributing deepfake videos to investigate, publicizing the results of what she found. Ding also interviewed a friend of hers who had a sex video released by an ex regarding the emotional effects of such acts of “revenge porn”. Following Ding’s video, the Telegram group made deepfake videos using Ding’s face free to view.
- Xiao Yu was arrested in New Taipei, but later arrested on 500,000 NT bail. Huang Jie has also announced that she and at least nine other victims of deepfake videos produced through the Telegram group would be filing a joint lawsuit against Xiao Yu.
- Certainly, the incident has drawn greater attention to the issue of deepfakes, and the potential for harm caused by the new technology. That being said, one notes that more generally, this is a more deeply issue, not simply one caused by advancements in technology.
- Problems regarding misogyny and sexism are rife in the Taiwanese media, particularly in sexist coverage of female public figures, such as celebrities or politicians. In recent memory, an ETToday journalist was arrested for taking inappropriate photos of female flight attendants during a 2019 strike, and circulating the photos online, receiving a relatively light sentence. Likewise, Apple Daily’s report on Huang Jie’s lawsuit included sexualized photos of some of the claimants.
- While deepfake technology may prove a new way of targeting public figures, the media is in itself already deeply complicit in this phenomenon, normalizing cultural attitudes that allow for the production and consumption of deepfakes. In this sense, deepfakes are only a symptom of a more deeply rooted issue in Taiwanese society.

- A Taiwanese YouTuber suspected of creating and selling deepfake porn videos featuring more than 100 politicians and influencers was on Monday released on bail after being arrested the previous day.
- Chu Yu-chen (朱玉宸), 26, who uses the name Xiaoyu (小玉) on YouTube, was arrested on Sunday in New Taipei City, along with two suspected accomplices, a 24-year-old YouTuber surnamed Yeh (耶), known as Shaiw Shaiw (笑笑), and a 22-year-old man Chuang (莊).
- The three suspects were on Monday escorted to the New Taipei District Prosecutors’ Office for further questioning on suspicion of distributing obscene videos and publicly insulting others, in contravention of the Criminal Code.
- Photo: CNA
- A conviction for distributing obscene videos carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison, which can be converted or added to a NT$90,000 (US$3,222) fine, while a public insult conviction could result in a fine of up to NT$9,000.
- New Taipei City Deputy Chief Prosecutor Nieh Chung (聶眾) said that while the alleged crimes were serious, it was not necessary to detain the suspects.
- He said the office originally set Chu’s bail at NT$500,000 and Chuang’s at NT$100,000, but because their assets were frozen, they were released on NT$300,000 and NT$50,000 bail respectively on Monday evening.
- Yeh was released without bail, Nieh said, without elaborating.
- The three are believed to have made more than NT$11 million over the past year by creating and distributing the videos, which were made by superimposing people’s faces onto existing pornographic videos using deep learning technology, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said.
- The videos make it seem as if the celebrities themselves are engaging in the sexual acts depicted. They are controversial, as the likenesses of those involved are usually used without their consent, it said.
- Deputy Commander of the 4th Investigation Corps Ko Chih-jen (柯志仁) told a CIB briefing on Monday that pornographic videos featuring famous Taiwanese politicians and influencers began circulating online in July last year.
- Chu operated the social media pages and was in charge of editing the videos, Chuang looked for video materials that could be used and Yeh dealt with the finances, a CIB investigation showed.
- President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) voiced her concern about the issue of deepfakes, saying that her administration would evaluate existing regulations and draft relevant amendments.
- Minister of Justice Tsai Ching-hsiang (蔡清祥) yesterday told legislators that the ministry has begun drafting related amendments and hoped to submit them to the legislature within a month.
- Kaohsiung City Councilor Huang Jie (黃捷), one of the people whose faces were used in the videos without their consent, said on Facebook on Monday that she had filed legal proceedings against the suspects.
- She said nine other victims, all of whom are female video game streamers, had messaged her about the videos and said they would also be pressing charges.
- Huang said she felt disgusted and afraid when she saw the videos herself, and indicated that the videos had caused real harm and humiliation to the victims.
- Legislator Kao Chia-yu (高嘉瑜), whose face was also used without her consent in the videos, said on Facebook that she would pursue legislation that specifically targets deepfakes, as Taiwan’s existing laws are inadequate to deal with the issue.
- The Central Weather Bureau could issue a sea alert for Super Typhoon Mawar, as it is forecast to turn north and come closest to Taiwan from Tuesday to Wednesday next week.
Mawar was downgraded from a super typhoon to a typhoon after sweeping across Guam on Wednesday night, knocking down trees and leaving much of the US territory without power. 
Many residents of Guam yesterday remained without power and utilities after Mawar tore through the remote US Pacific territory the previous night, ripping roofs off homes, flipping vehicles and shredding trees.
There were no immediate reports of deaths and injuries, but the

                                        Over the next five years, every year except 2026 would have only one makeup workday to compensate for national holidays, the government said                                        The Executive Yuan (EY) yesterday announced the official workday calendar for next year, which includes one makeup day and four holidays with more than three days off.
It also announced new standards for makeup days in the event of consecutive holidays.
The Directorate-General of Personnel Administration cited the importance of the Lunar New Year and Tomb Sweeping holidays to the public as its reason to mandate flexible off-days.
The 115 total off-days dovetail with dates that international financial markets are closed, minimizing the effects of state holidays on stock and currency exchange trading, it said.
Over the next five years, only the calendar for

                                        Chinese would likely accept their government having a softer stance toward cross-strait relations, one of the coauthors of the article said                                        Interest among the Chinese public in the issue of China’s unification with Taiwan is low, researchers said, citing the results of a poll.
An article titled “Assessing Public Support for (Non-)Peaceful Unification with Taiwan: Evidence from a Nationwide Survey in China,” published in the Journal of Contemporary China on May 14, showed that only 55 percent of those surveyed in China would support the use of military force to achieve unification with Taiwan.

- TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) pledged on Monday (Oct. 18) to crack down on deepfakes after many celebrities have fallen victim to a crime involving pornographic videos.
- Tsai said in a Facebook post that people have been profiting from manipulating the images of prominent figures and said that "we cannot sit idly by while these illegal activities happen unchecked." The government will push for tighter rules on the use of relevant technologies as it endeavors to stamp out disinformation and AI-generated fake videos, she added.
- The move comes after a 26-year-old influencer going by the name of “Hsiao Yu” (小玉) was arrested Sunday (Oct. 17) over making deceitful videos where celebrities’ faces were swapped onto actors or actresses in porn films. The deepfakes were produced by exploiting machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies.
- Hsiao Yu touted the doctored footage via messaging platform Telegram and is believed to have made NT$10 million (US$357,429) from the crime. At least one hundred people, including politicians, entertainers, and YouTubers, have become victims of deepfake porn, CNA reported.
- Chu was released Monday after posting NT$300,000 bail. He and his accomplice, surnamed Chuang (莊), now face a criminal charge punishable by up to two years of imprisonment and/or a fine of NT$90,000.
- The Women In Digital Initiative, a Taiwan-based group for women’s rights, has urged heavier punishment to be imposed on such crime, saying current penalties have failed to curb such unlawful activities. Meanwhile, it is calling for more adequate resources to fight digital crime that is running rampant in the country.

- The saying, “A picture speaks a thousand words” is a common one. However, as technology has advanced, the saying has become less reliable. Nowadays, its easy to fake visual media, especially with deepfake technology. One of its unsavoury uses is to make pornographic videos.
- Using deepfake technology to make porno videos is, unfortunately, more common than we’d like. It is a breach of privacy, yet many see it as an easy way to make money, as this Taiwanese YouTuber did. This morning (18th October), police arrested Xiao Yu (小玉)  for making pornographic videos of internet celebrities using deepfake technology.
- Xiao Yu (real name: Zhu Yuchen, 朱玉宸) retired from YouTube earlier this year in April. Many fans were saddened when he left, but others felt it was for the best. Although the YouTuber was popular with his funny videos, he had caused several controversies prior to him leaving. One was when he unpacked a weapon, which violated the Controlling Guns, Ammunition, and Knives Act. Xiao Yu also upset many when he tasted breast milk and openly showed his dislike for it. Many felt the video devalued women. The YouTuber has apologised for both instances, however, it doesn’t seem like an apology will save him this time.
- Xiao Yu’s scheme was discovered after another YouTuber Kuiding (奎丁) aka Zamy came across porno videos of herself last year. As she had not filmed such videos, the YouTuber publicly claimed that the videos were fake. It was soon discovered that the videos originated from a Telegram group. The group “Taiwan Internet Celebrities” had videos and photos of many celebs and artists for sale, including stand up comedian Long Long (龙龙, Linqian Yu, 林千玉), and Youtuber “Idiot Princess (白痴公主)” Daiping Ya (戴平雅).  Zamy reported the matter to the police who agreed to look into it. Taiwan police later discovered the person heading the group was none other than former YouTuber Xiao Yu.
- He was arrested this morning along with three other employees. Police seized 4, 585, 000 yuan (about RM2 million), 2 computers, 2 hard disks, 2 mobile phones and a BENZ car among other things. Needless to say, his arrest came as a shock to many. Although Xiao Yu has used deepfake technology once for a YouTube video, no one suspected he would later use it for unscrupulous means.
- According to the police, the group requires a membership fee of 400 yuan (about RM260). Members can either order or bid for the adult videos. For “customisation”, its service ranges from 300 to 3000 Taiwanese dollars (about RM44 to RM446). The group promotes its services on Twitter and has so far eluded the police. There are roughly 6000 members in the group with videos of at least 100 victims circulated.
- Zamy, one of the few known victims, was disappointed by the news. She admitted she used to support the YouTuber before he retired. Discovering he had taken advantage of her came as a betrayal. “(You) really cannot (trust) people like Xiang Yu,” she wrote in her Instagram story.
- Netizens are disgusted and furious with the former YouTuber. It isn’t hard to see why. His earlier actions of devaluing women by disliking breast milk pale in comparison to this.
- No apology can recover the privacy of those who were violated in the videos. The videos may have been fakes, but they have long lasting effects. Hopefully, the police will bring justice to the former YouTuber soon.

- High-profile politician Kao Chia-yu revealed she had been assaulted by her boyfriend, sparking sympathy from some and cynical political attacks from others.
- There has been increased discussions of violence against women in Taiwan after Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Kao Chia-yu revealed that she had been physically assaulted by her partner, Lin Bing-shu, a pan-Green political columnist who writes under the pen name of Raphael Lin. Kao represents the Neihu-Nangang area of Taipei as a legislator.
- News of the incident broke after a report published by Mirror Media on November 30. The report stated that Lin beat Kao after finding that she was exchanging text messages with an ex-boyfriend, injuring her face and limbs. The assault allegedly occurred at a hotel in Banqiao, New Taipei, where the two were staying following a campaign rally for the upcoming national referendum. After attacking her, Lin reportedly seized Kao’s phone and kept her confined to the hotel, using private videos taken from Kao’s phone as leverage over her.
- Lin, who reportedly has a history of violence against past partners, has denied taking videos or imprisoning Kao.
- The incident took place on November 11, with Kao subsequently disappearing from public view for several days. When Kao made a televised media appearance on November 17, she was wearing a medical mask to cover her injuries, despite the fact that current COVID-19 regulations in Taiwan do not require masks to be worn on television programs.
- Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.
- According to the Mirror Media report, Kao emphasized that the matter was a private one when initially contacted by the outlet. However, when contacted again on November 29, one day before the report was published, Kao confirmed that she had been a victim of assault.

- On the morning of November 29, Kao filed a police report against Lin. An arrest warrant was granted to prosecutors that night and Lin was taken into custody in the early morning hours of November 30. Charges faced by Lin include assault, forcible imprisonment, and violating personal privacy.
- According to radio host Clara Chou, who is known for reporting inside stories about the government and often has high-profile government officials as guests on her program, President Tsai Ing-wen was informed of the incident by national security officials that learned of the assault after Kao sought medical treatment for her injuries. However, Tsai sought to respect Kao’s wishes and tried to persuade her to report the crime.
- Kao Chia-yu, 41, is one of the DPP’s rising cohort of younger politicians. Unlike other youth politicians that entered politics in the wake of the 2014 Sunflower Movement, Kao’s political career began far earlier. After a stint as the assistant of then-legislator Luo Wen-jia, Kao became the youngest ever member of the National Assembly in 2005.
- By then, the National Assembly was already a defunct institution, and the election was only for the purposes of ratifying constitutional changes already approved by the Legislative Yuan. The National Assembly was abolished later that year, following which Kao successfully ran for Taipei city councilor in 2010, winning re-election in 2014 and 2018. Kao then became a legislator in the 2020 elections.
- In Taiwanese media, Kao has sometimes been held up as a standard for the careers of other young DPP politicians to compare to, particularly those who may be well-known public figures but have not actually campaigned for and won office.
- Kao is a widely discussed figure in Taiwan. A study of online mentions of Taiwanese politicians in November 2020 found that Kao was only surpassed in mentions by Tsai. At the time, Kao was in the headlines – members of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) had questioned her real estate holdings when Kao posted a photo of her messy apartment online, as part of a Facebook post drawing attention to the dismal living conditions faced by many young people.
- In particular, Kao has at time been a magnet for political attacks from the pan-Blue camp. In another recent example, Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je attempted to blame Kao for two clinics in Taipei violating vaccination priority order.
- Now the domestic abuse accusation has Kao in the headlines again. Among those to criticize the violence faced by Kao include Tsai and Premier Su Tseng-chang. Some politicians crossed party lines to express support for Kao, with KMT legislator Chen Yu-jen making a lengthy post on Facebook supportive of Kao, which also reflected on her own past experiences with abusive partners.
- However, in Taiwan’s starkly partisan political environment, other politicians have used the occasion for political attacks on the DPP. Taipei city councilor Hsu Chiao-hsin, one of the KMT’s up-and-coming youth politicians and another young female politician, referred to Lin as “Daluban” (塔綠班) – a pun on “Taliban” (塔利班) used by members of the KMT to allege that members of the pan-Green camp are politically violent.
- KMT Central Committee member Huang Chin-wei further raised eyebrows by stating that Kao deserved to be beaten by Lin. Huang’s comments were criticized by KMT chairman Eric Chu; the party issued an official statement and Huang apologized. But Chu also came under scrutiny for using the term “Daluban” to refer to Lin in public comments. Similarly, NPP International Affairs Department Director Jerry Liu came under fire for a Facebook post first expressing sympathy for Kao, but then attempting to steer criticisms toward the DPP.

- The incident serves as a reminder of longstanding issues regarding violence against women in Taiwan – even for women in positions of power, such as Kao, and at a time in which Taiwan is governed by its first female president. According to survey data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, one in five women in Taiwan report having been in abusive relationships.
- Statistics show that a case of abuse occurs on average every five minutes in Taiwan, with 322 cases reported per day. According to statistics gathered by the Garden of Hope Foundation, a Taiwanese NGO established in 1988 to help survivors of sexual abuse and domestic violence, around 100,000 cases of domestic abuse were reported per year between 2005 and 2020. As with elsewhere in the world, it is thought that cases of abuse have experienced an uptick since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. New Taipei reported a 29 percent increase in incidents of domestic violence in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic and, while Taiwan was able to remain primarily COVID-free throughout 2020, such issues likely worsened after Taiwan was hit by its first major COVID-19 outbreak in May 2021.
- Taiwan has a reputation for progressive views on sexuality in Asia after becoming the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage in 2019. Yet laws criminalizing adultery remained on the books until a May 2020 court ruling, making Taiwan one of the last places in Asia to retain such laws. The anti-adultery laws allowed for a cottage industry of private detectives that stalked, threatened, and harassed individuals – mostly women – in the name of gathering evidence for legal cases. Even after the criminal laws were scrapped, it is still possible for civil cases to be filed for infidelity.
- In past years, women’s advocacy groups have also criticized anti-stalking laws in Taiwan as toothless, with light penalties failing to deter individuals from committing violence against women. As a result, on December 1, President Tsai Ing-wen promulgated a strengthened version of the Stalking and Harassment Prevention Act. In comments as she signed the bill into law, Tsai brought up the 1996 murder of Peng Wan-ru, the head of the DPP’s Women’s Affairs Department and a well-known feminist activist.
- In recent times, there has also been greater attention paid to non-physical forms of harassment against women. In October, YouTuber Zhu Yu-chen was arrested for running a series of Telegram groups that produced and sold “deepfake” pornographic videos of women – mostly prominent public figures, though Zhu also accepted commissions to make deepfake videos of lesser-known individuals as a form of “revenge porn.” In Taiwanese media discourse, this case was frequently compared to the “Nth Room Case” in South Korea.
- Among others, the Telegram group produced deepfake videos of female politicians including Kao, Kaohsiung city councilor Huang Jie, and social media influencers, with a number of the victims jointly filing charges against Zhu. Following Zhu’s arrest, Tsai weighed in on the issue on Facebook, with some public discussion about how existing laws to punish “revenge porn” or deepfake pornography may be insufficient due to the advancement of new forms of technology. In a Facebook post by Kao thanking supporters after the recent incident, Kao sought to draw further attention to the issue of deepfakes.
- Yet despite greater awareness of these issues, media coverage of the abuse faced by Kao Chia-yu has itself been sensationalist. Taiwanese media have long-standing issues with misogyny, often providing highly sexualized coverage of female subjects, including in the event of personal tragedy or abuse by their partners. As such, the issues women face do not simply stem from the development of new technology, but return to more deeply-rooted issues in Taiwanese society, inclusive of its media culture.

- Taipei, Jan. 5 (CNA) The New Taipei District Court recently ruled that a Taiwanese YouTuber and his accomplice should pay NT$500,000 (US$16,290) in joint compensation to a female YouTuber for using her likenesses in deepfake pornographic videos which they sold online.
- The decision can still be appealed.
- Chu Yu-chen (朱玉宸), 27, who goes by Xiaoyu (小玉) on YouTube, was arrested in October 2021 on suspicion of creating and selling deepfake pornographic videos of 119 people, including politicians and influencers, making more than NT$13 million in illicit profits between July 2020 and October 2021, along with his assistant, Chuang Hsin-jui (莊炘睿).
- The victims included Kaohsiung City Councilor Huang Jie (黃捷), Legislator Kao Chia-yu (高嘉瑜), and social media influencer Ili Cheng (鄭家純), according to prosecutors in New Taipei.
- In July 2022, the district court sentenced Chu and Chuang to five years and six months and three years and eight months in prison, respectively, for violations of the Personal Data Protection Act, with the sentences commutable to fines.
- New Taipei prosecutors have appealed the ruling on the grounds that the sentences are too lenient.
- Meanwhile, 21 victims of deepfake videos have filed civil lawsuits seeking financial compensation from Chu and Chuang for misuse of their likenesses.
- As a result, the district court said on Dec. 12 last year it had ordered Chu and Chuang to pay joint compensation of NT$1 million to each of two victims -- Huang and an unidentified female flight attendant.
- Another victim, a female YouTuber, also sought compensation of NT$1 million from Chu and Chuang, stating that they earned more than NT$13 million through the illegal activity, causing harm to her reputation.
- Chu admitted that although he created obscene videos through deepfake technology to make money, he had not intended to insult or belittle the people depicted in the videos and did not seek to harm their reputations.
- The dissemination of the deepfake pornographic videos was limited to registered members of Chu's Youtube channel who knew the videos were not authentic, Chu argued, adding that he never sought to maliciously harm the reputation of those whose likenesses were used in the videos.
- In addition, while Chuang agreed he and Chu should pay restitution to the female Youtuber, he asked that the joint compensation be reduced to NT$500,000.
- New Taipei District Court found that placing the face of the victim on the body of a porn actress for people to watch in deepfake videos seriously undermined the female YouTuber's reputation.
- Only after the woman agreed to the offer of NT$500,000 in compensation did the court accept the defendant's offer, according to the verdict handed down on Dec. 27 last year.

- （中央社記者高華謙新北5日電）網紅「小玉」朱玉宸與助理莊炘睿移植受害者臉部到色情片牟利，台灣新北地方法院近期再判2人須賠償女YouTuber新台幣50萬元，可上訴。
- 檢警調查，朱玉宸與莊炘睿利用人工智慧深偽技術（Deepfake）合成119名被害人臉部製成色情影片，自民國109年7月起到110年10月共牟利1300餘萬元，包括無黨籍高雄市議員黃捷、民主進步黨籍立法委員高嘉瑜與網紅鄭家純等受害。

- The legislature yesterday passed draft amendments to curb the use of sexual images and video that would make the production and spread of fake or manipulated images and video for profit a crime punishable by up to seven years in prison.
- The draft amendments to the Criminal Code include an additional article dedicated to a new form of crime using artificial intelligence — deepfakes — which involve inserting the likeness of a person into an existing image or video.
- The draft amendments were proposed after the arrest in 2021 of a Taiwanese YouTuber for making and selling “deepfake” pornographic videos of dozens of prominent women, including politicians.
- Photo: CNA
- The approved legislation includes a provision stipulating that producing sexual material involving images or video footage of another individual without that person’s consent is subject to a maximum sentence of three years in prison, while the unauthorized distribution of such material could result in a prison term of six months to five years.
- Anyone found guilty of distributing such content for profit faces an additional sentence of up to one half of the prescribed sentence, the amendment states.
- The bill also includes a provision that anyone convicted of producing sexual images or video of another individual through the use of threats or violence faces up to five years in prison and one to seven years if distribution is involved.
- Photo: CNA
- Without the consent of the party involved, those who reproduce, distribute, broadcast, deliver, display or use other methods to display sexual images of others would be subject to a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to NT$500,000 (US$16,289).
- The draft also stipulates that those who produce or disseminate deepfakes face a sentence of up to five years in jail and, if the offense is profit-related, up to seven years.
- Kaohsiung City Councilor Huang Jie (黃捷) said the passing of the law is the “best New Year’s gift” to victims of sexual exploitation, and thanked lawmakers for making it happen.
- The law could be improved with regard to curbing “digital sexual violence,” including by creating mechanisms to immediately remove illegal images and video from Internet platforms, she added.
- Lawmakers also passed a third reading of amendments to the Crime Victim Protection Act (犯罪被害人權益保障法).
- The amendments expand the protections offered to victims of new forms of crime, including revenge porn and secretly filmed sexual content.
- The changes authorize judicial authorities to impose restraining orders against suspects for up to two years during the trial period.
- Compensation for next of kin in manslaughter or murder cases would be set at NT$1.8 million, while victims of crimes resulting in severe injuries would receive NT$800,000 to NT$1.6 million, and victims of sexual assault would receive NT$100,000 to NT$400,000.
- New Power Party Legislator Claire Wang (王婉諭) said that “this amendment has … expanded the social safety net for victims of crime, including more programs to better protect the victims.”
- “However, government agencies must allocate consistent, long-term funding. If not, these are merely administrative orders, without actual legal enforcement,” she said, adding that the current funding is insufficient.
- Groups protested outside the Legislative Yuan, including representatives from the Association for Victims Support, the Judicial Reform Foundation, the Taipei Women’s Rescue Foundation and the Taiwan Children’s Rights Association.
- Taiwan Children’s Rights Association founder Wang Wei-chun (王薇君) said that the changes do not go far enough.
- “I especially cannot accept that lawmakers imposed a cap on the compensation for [murder] at NT$1.8 million. This is not sufficient for many families experiencing economic hardship,” she said.

- The Central Weather Bureau could issue a sea alert for Super Typhoon Mawar, as it is forecast to turn north and come closest to Taiwan from Tuesday to Wednesday next week.
Mawar was downgraded from a super typhoon to a typhoon after sweeping across Guam on Wednesday night, knocking down trees and leaving much of the US territory without power. 
Many residents of Guam yesterday remained without power and utilities after Mawar tore through the remote US Pacific territory the previous night, ripping roofs off homes, flipping vehicles and shredding trees.
There were no immediate reports of deaths and injuries, but the

It also announced new standards for makeup days in the event of consecutive holidays.
The Directorate-General of Personnel Administration cited the importance of the Lunar New Year and Tomb Sweeping holidays to the public as its reason to mandate flexible off-days.

An article titled “Assessing Public Support for (Non-)Peaceful Unification with Taiwan: Evidence from a Nationwide Survey in China,” published in the Journal of Contemporary China on May 14, showed that only 55 percent of those surveyed in China would support the use of military force to achieve unification with Taiwan.
In the survey, which polled 1,824 people on the question of how they would like to see the issue of Taiwan’s unification with China resolved, “only one out of
