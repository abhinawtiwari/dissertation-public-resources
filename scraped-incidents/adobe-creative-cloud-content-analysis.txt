- Launched in 2011, Adobe Creative Cloud is a set of 20+ Adobe graphic design, video editing, web development, and photography applications and services delivered over the Internet.
- In January 2023, a row erupted over the discovery that Adobe appears to be automatically analysing customer content stored on Creative Cloud to train its AI algorithms, unless they choose to opt-out of the service.
- The discovery sparked graphic designers, artists and other customers to share their concerns that Adobe is abusing their privacy and stealing their work to improve its own automated systems. Some see it as another indication that their jobs are at risk of being replaced by robots.
- Adobe's content analysis FAQ states it may use machine learning 'to develop and improve our products and services' and 'provide product features and customize our products and services ', providing examples such as the correction of perspective in images and automatically enhancing a document's headings and tables.
- The row reflects broader concerns amongst artists, illustrators and others that their work is being scraped and used to train generative AI models such as DALL-E and Midjourney without their consent, thereby abusing their IP, commoditising their output, and potentially putting them out of work.
- Adobe responded by saying it 'does not use data stored on customers’ Creative Cloud accounts to train its experimental Generative AI features.'
- In a Bloomberg interview, Adobe Scott Belsky later claimed the company never trained its generative AI services on customer projects.

- 
- Adobe Creative Cloud is a set of applications and services from Adobe Inc. that gives subscribers access to a collection of software used for graphic design, video editing, web development, photography, along with a set of mobile applications and also some optional cloud services. In Creative Cloud, a monthly or annual subscription service is delivered over the Internet.[3][4] Software from Creative Cloud is downloaded from the Internet, installed directly on a local computer and used as long as the subscription remains valid. Online updates and multiple languages are included in the CC subscription. Creative Cloud was initially hosted on Amazon Web Services, but a new agreement with Microsoft has the software, beginning with the 2017 version, hosted on Microsoft Azure.[5]
- Previously, Adobe offered individual products as well as software suites containing several products (such as Adobe Creative Suite or Adobe eLearning Suite) with a perpetual software license.[6]
- Adobe first announced the Creative Cloud in October 2011. Another version of Adobe Creative Suite was released the following year.[7] On May 6, 2013, Adobe announced that they would not release new versions of the Creative Suite and that future versions of its software would be available only through the Creative Cloud.[8][9][10] The first new versions made only for the Creative Cloud were released on June 17, 2013.
- The Adobe Creative Cloud retains many of the features of Adobe Creative Suite and introduces new features;[11] foremost is the instant availability of upgrades, saving to the cloud, and easier sharing. In June 2014, the company announced 14 new versions of the Creative Cloud essential desktop tools, four new mobile apps, and the availability of creative hardware for enterprise, education and photography customers.[12][13][14]
- The video disc authoring program Adobe Encore and the web-focused bitmap editor Adobe Fireworks were both discontinued by Adobe in 2013, but were still available as downloads via Creative Cloud until May 2019.
- Adobe offers four tiers of the Creative Cloud subscription service for individuals (there are other types for Business and Schools):[15]
- The following contains the services found on Creative Cloud.

- The change from perpetual licenses to a subscription model was met with significant criticism.[20][21] Although Adobe's cloud-based model caused disagreement and uncertainty,[20] and incited annoyance[22] and conflict,[23] a survey by CNET and Jefferies revealed that despite complaints most of its 1.4 million subscribers[23][24] plan to renew.[25][26]
- Shifting to a software as a service model, Adobe announced more frequent feature updates to its products and the eschewing of their traditional release cycles.[27] Customers must pay a monthly subscription fee. Consequently, if subscribers cancel or stop paying, they will lose access to the software as well as the ability to open work saved in proprietary file formats.[28]
- Although investors applauded the move, many customers reacted negatively.[29] This shift has been met with mixed reviews by both corporations and independent designers, with many people expressing their displeasure on the web[30][31][32] and through multiple Internet petitions.[33] Among these was a Change.org petition which reached over 30,000 signatures within a few weeks of the announcement.[34]
- Creative Cloud has been criticized for broken file syncing, one of its core features.[35][36] In May 2013 Adobe announced that it was suspending the file-sync desktop preview "for the next couple of weeks".[35] Reviewers of Creative Cloud were disappointed with the functionality of the cloud storage[37][38][39] and were "far from convinced by Adobe's subscription model".[40] Some users were concerned that they would be forced to upgrade their computer hardware when it is no longer supported by the current version of the Creative Cloud software.[41]
- Some of their customers experienced a loss of trust in Adobe as a company and an attendant rise in anxiety.[42][43] Despite significant customer criticism over Adobe's move to subscription-only pricing,[44] the company announced that it would not sell perpetual licenses to its software alongside the subscriptions: "We understand this is a big change, but we are so focused on the vision we shared for Creative Cloud, and we plan to focus all our new innovation on the Creative Cloud".[45]
- In May 2014 the service was interrupted for over a day due to a login outage leaving graphics professionals locked out of Creative Cloud.[46][47][48][49][50] Adobe apologized for this global Creative Cloud failure.[51][52] When initially asked whether customers would be compensated, the company's Customer Service responded: "We cannot offer compensation for the outage. I'm so sorry again for the frustration."[53][54] Adobe later announced that it would review compensation on "a case by case basis".[55] The outage was heavily criticized, as was Adobe's software as a service model in general.[56]
- Online articles began offering examples of replacements of Adobe products,[57][58][59][60][61] with competing products directly offering alternatives, and launching promotions for dissatisfied Adobe customers.[62] Adobe, however, claimed that Creative Cloud is its "highest customer satisfaction product in the creative space" and that even prior to Adobe's move to a pure subscription model, "more than 80 percent of customers who bought products from Adobe's Web site picked CC over CS."[45]
- Although Creative Cloud was expected to curtail the piracy of Photoshop,[63] which is one of the most pirated pieces of software,[64] Creative Cloud was hacked and its applications made available via unauthorized means a day after it officially launched.[65][66] Adobe claimed that the subscription payment plan would make its software more accessible to users who previously pirated it.[67]
- On May 14, 2019, some Creative Cloud users received emails from Adobe stating that licenses to previous versions of Creative Cloud applications had been terminated and that users could face civil action from third parties if they did not update the software on their personal computers. A representative from Adobe confirmed the letter's authenticity. The situation prompted renewed criticism of Adobe's subscription-only business model.[68]

- Find anwers to your questions about content analysis for your Creative Cloud and Document Cloud apps.
- Adobe may analyze your Creative Cloud or Document Cloud content to provide product features and improve and develop our products and services. Creative Cloud and Document Cloud content include but aren't limited to image, audio, video, text or document files, and associated data. Adobe performs content analysis only on content processed or stored on Adobe's servers; we don't analyze content processed or stored locally on your device.
- Let's say that you access Creative Cloud or Document Cloud via a personal account and prefer that Adobe doesn't analyze your content to develop and improve our products and services. In that case, you may turn off content analysis at any time from your Adobe account (see details and exceptions later).
- Adobe primarily uses machine learning in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud to analyze your content. Machine learning describes a subset of artificial intelligence in which a computing system uses algorithms to analyze and learn from data without human intervention to draw inferences from patterns and make predictions. The system may continue to learn and improve over time as it receives more data.
- We use machine learning to develop and improve our products and services, enabling us to deliver innovative and cutting-edge solutions. We also use machine learning to provide product features and customize our products and services.
- Machine learning-enabled features can help you become more efficient and creative. For example, we may use machine learning-enabled features to help you organize and edit your images more quickly and accurately. With object recognition in Lightroom, we can auto-tag photos of your dog or cat. In Photoshop, machine learning can be used to automatically correct the perspective of an image for you. With Liquid Mode in Acrobat, we optimize the readability of a PDF by, for example, automatically enhancing a document's headings and tables to help you more easily scroll through and read dense documents.
- Machine learning-enabled features are also used to make context-aware suggestions. For example, Content-Aware Fill in Photoshop analyzes your image and predicts the correct content to insert in a selected area. And in Acrobat, we can still provide search suggestions despite misspelling a search term.
- Adobe may analyze your content that is processed or stored on Adobe servers. We don't analyze content processed or stored locally on your device. When we analyze your content for product improvement and development purposes, we first aggregate your content with other content and then use the aggregated content to train our algorithms and thus improve our products and services. If you don't want Adobe to use your content for these purposes, you can opt-out of content analysis at any time (see details and exceptions described).
- In limited circumstances, we may manually review your content for product improvement and development purposes in the following situations:
- Our manual review process includes safeguards to help protect your privacy. If you submit non-public content for manual review, we will perform the manual review with personnel subject to confidentiality requirements and privacy training.
- Adobe takes your privacy seriously. Your privacy is maintained during content analysis for product improvement and development. None of your content is included in our products or services unless you make them public (for example, contributions to Adobe Stock and Behance). The insights obtained through content analysis will not be used to re-create your content or lead to identifying any personal information.
- You can find an overview of how Adobe may use your information (including content) in the Adobe Privacy Center.
- For Adobe Firefly, the first model is trained on Adobe Stock images, openly licensed content, and public domain content where the copyright has expired. You can find more information on Adobe Firefly in the Adobe Firefly FAQ.
- You can turn off content analysis at any time if you're a customer accessing Creative Cloud and Document Cloud products and services via a personal account. (This setting doesn't apply to organization or school accounts, which are governed by your organization or school’s agreement with Adobe.) Turning off content analysis doesn't affect your ability to use any features.
- If you don't want Adobe to analyze your content in the manner described, take the following steps:
- Sign in at  https://account.adobe.com/privacy.
- In the Content analysis section, deactivate the toggle for Allow my content to be analyzed by Adobe for product improvement and development purposes.
- 
- Turning off content analysis doesn't affect our ability to analyze your content when you participate in programs where you proactively submit content to develop and improve our products and services. If you don't want your content to be used for such purposes, you should avoid participating in those programs, including but not limited to:
- Additionally, if you use features that rely on content analysis techniques (for example, Content-Aware Fill in Photoshop), your content may still be analyzed when you use those features to help improve that feature.

- You type in “A pirate ship floating in the San Francisco Bay” and seconds later, images appear of a galleon with skull & crossbones sails, passing beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. The technology is called Generative Artificial Intelligence and it seems to translate your imagination to a computer screen.
- Adobe, along with many other innovators, has been experimenting with Generative AI. It is a transformational technology, one that will accelerate the ways artists brainstorm and explore creative avenues — and make creativity accessible to millions more people.
- At the same time, like a lot of new technologies, Generative AI has raised valid concerns. Among the questions: How is the work of creative people being used to train the AI models? And how will we know whether something we see was created by a human or a computer?
- From the launch of Photoshop to the rise of 3D, Adobe has a 40-year history of helping lead the creative community through technological transformations in how we create. We are committed to helping lead this transition by implementing Generative AI in our tools in a way that empowers artists and opens creativity to new people, but never seeks to replace human imagination and judgment. And we are working with the creative and technological communities to ensure that Generative AI is developed with transparency.
- Today, at Adobe MAX, we announced our approach to developing creator-centric Generative AI offerings by leveraging Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) standards and investing in new research to support creatives' control over their style and work.
- The CAI is an Adobe-led initiative with more than 800 partners working to increase trust online. CAI’s open-source technology enables creators to securely attach provenance data to digital content, helping ensure that creators get credit for their work, and for those who view a piece of content understand who made it and how it was created and edited.
- As impressive as early Generative AI is, the first models have, in some ways, cut out human beings. You give the AI your prompt and the machine generates some images. If you don’t like those images, you have to reword your prompt and hope you get something closer to what you want.
- We are investing our research and product design talent to develop an approach that centers on the needs of creatives by integrating Generative AI in Adobe creative tools.
- https://main--blog--adobe.hlx.page/media_1f3f6d79aa6f17ef5b8d870e3fc6cf4819fadcf3d.mp4
- In Photoshop, Generative AI will let you add new objects to an image, create variations based on your existing image, or even add a new section to your composite just by describing what you want.
- We’re still early in our journey, but let’s imagine, for instance, AI within Photoshop that generates rich, editable PSDs. The AI can generate a dozen different approaches and you can pick the two or three you want to explore further, using Photoshop’s full selection of tools to transform the AI-generated image into something that faithfully reflects your creative perspective.
- https://main--blog--adobe.hlx.page/media_134e0dc0500068039e1ac42d3642843ba2f6a6327.mp4
- With breakthrough AI in Adobe Express, you’ll be able to create unique text effects that marry perfectly with your image by providing suggestions like “electrical cables” or “orchid petals.”
- Generative AI incorporated into Adobe Express will help less experienced creators achieve their unique goals. Rather than having to find a pre-made template to start a project with, Express users could generate a template through a prompt, and use Generative AI to add an object to the scene, or create a unique text effect based on their description. But they still will have full control — they can use all of the Adobe Express tools for editing images, changing colors, and adding fonts to create the flyer, poster, or social media post they imagine.
- And while early Generative AI explorations have focused primarily on images, we believe the technology will help creatives working in all mediums — video, 3D design, texture creation, logo design, and more.
- https://main--blog--adobe.hlx.page/media_14a6c2bb837ec329e5933828582c473692914186e.mp4
- With Generative AI in Lightroom, you’ll be able to change a daytime scene to nighttime, change shadows and other details, and even expand a photo beyond the scene you shot.
- We see Generative AI as a hyper-competent creative assistant. It will multiply what creators can achieve by presenting new images and alternative approaches, but it can never replace what we value in art: human imagination, an idiosyncratic style, and a unique personal story. Creativity is ultimately a form of communication and what we value about art isn’t just the brushstrokes or colors — it’s the story and the human being who’s telling that story.
- Adobe has a history of leadership in the development of responsible AI. We spent several years devising standards for how to responsibly develop AI, and all the AI features we launched at this year’s Adobe MAX have been evaluated to ensure they meet those standards. In 2019, anticipating the potential for AI tools to be used to manipulate media in a way that distorts reality and creates misinformation, we launched the Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI).
- We are committed to incorporating CAI technology in our creative tools. The CAI standard will enable creators to show whether, and how, Generative AI technology was used to create a piece of content. As Generative AI becomes a bigger part of the creative process, we believe many viewers of content will be vitally interested in that information.
- We also know that creative people want to exercise control over their style and work, and we’re committed to new research to support that goal.
- Art has always been a mixture of craft and other qualities harder to define — style, judgment, and eye. The history of art is an unbroken series of technical innovations — the development of ceramic kilns, invention of oil paints, debut of digital photography — all of which accelerated these crafts. As craft becomes less of an obstacle, the role of the creator — their vision, story, and imagination — becomes more — not less — important. We believe the same will be true with Generative AI and we’re excited to develop AI tools that will help you express your personal vision.

- If you use Adobe products with cloud storage or backup, like Photoshop or Lightroom, the company may be using your data to train machine learning algorithms. Here’s how to opt out.
- Adobe explains on its website that the company “may analyze your Creative Cloud or Document Cloud content to provide product features and improve and develop our products and services.” The scanned data may include images, audio files, video, text, or other documents stored in Creative Cloud or synchronized between devices.
- Adobe says that the analysis only runs “on content processed or stored on Adobe’s servers,” so in theory, editing local Photoshop files or using Lightroom Classic with a local library shouldn’t result in your images being scanned. The machine learning is used to train object recognition in Lightroom, Liquid Mode in Acrobat, and other similar features, which is all fine — if Adobe had asked first. Adobe is vague about how it could use data collected through AI in the future, but the company is already experimenting with generative AI.
- Thankfully, turning off Adobe’s AI-powered content analysis is a quick process. Go to account.adobe.com/privacy in your web browser — if you’re not logged in already, Adobe’s site will ask you to do that first. Then scroll down to “Content analysis” and set the switch to “Off.”
- 
- Adobe notes that it may still “manually review your content” in specific situations, such as content that is made public (like uploading to Adobe Stock or the featured section on Adobe Express), participating in a beta or early access problem. However, images you keep for your own private use should be safe.

- A sharp-eyed developer at Krita noticed recently that, in the settings for their Adobe Creative Cloud account, the company had opted them (and everyone else) into a “content analysis” program whereby they “may analyze your content using techniques such as machine learning (e.g. for pattern recognition) to develop and improve our products and services.” Some have taken this to mean that it is ingesting your images for its AI. And … they do. Kind of? But it’s not that simple.
- First off, lots of software out there has some kind of “share information with the developer” option, where it sends telemetry like how often you use the app or certain features, why it crashed, etc. Usually it gives you an option to turn this off during installation, but not always — Microsoft incurred the ire of many when it basically said telemetry was on by default and impossible to turn off in Windows 10.
- That’s gross, but what’s worse is slipping a new sharing method and opting existing users into it. Adobe told PetaPixel that this content analysis thing “is not new and has been in place for a decade.” If they were using machine learning for this purpose and said so a decade ago, that’s quite impressive, as is that apparently no one noticed that whole time. That seems unlikely. I suspect the policy has existed in some form but has quietly evolved.
- But the wording of the setting is clear: It may analyze your content using machine learning not for the purposes of training machine learning. As it says in the “learn more” link:
- For example, we may use machine learning-enabled features to help you organize and edit your images more quickly and accurately. With object recognition in Lightroom, we can auto-tag photos of your dog or cat. In Photoshop, machine learning can be used to automatically correct the perspective of an image for you.
- A machine learning analysis would also allow Adobe to tell how many people were using Photoshop to, say, edit images of people versus landscapes, or other high-level metadata. That could inform product decisions and priorities.
- You may very well say, but that language does leave open the possibility that the images and analysis will be used to train AI models, as part of the “developing our products and services” thing.
- Make yours look like this. Image Credits: Adobe
- Make yours look like this. Image Credits: Adobe
- True, but Adobe clarified that “Adobe does not use any data stored on customers’ Creative Cloud accounts to train its experimental Generative AI features.” That wording is clear enough, though it also has the kind of legal precision that makes you think they’re talking around something.
- If you look closer at its documentation, it does indeed say: “When we analyze your content for product improvement and development purposes, we first aggregate your content with other content and then use the aggregated content to train our algorithms and thus improve our products and services.”
- So it does use your content to train its algorithms. Perhaps just not its experimental Generative AI algorithms.
- In fact, Adobe has a program specifically for doing that: the Adobe Photoshop Improvement Program, which is opt-in and documented here. But it’s entirely possible that your photos are, through one tube or another, being used as content to train a generative AI. There are also circumstances when it might be manually reviewed, which is a whole other thing.
- Even if it isn’t the case that Adobe is harvesting your creativity for its models, you should opt out of this program and any others if you value privacy. You can do so right here at the privacy page if you’re logged in.

It’s been discovered that Adobe has automatically opted users into a ‘Content analysis’ program that allows Adobe to analyze your media files in Creative Cloud for use in its machine learning training programs.
- It's unclear when exactly this program and setting went into effect, but it became widely noticed after Twitter user Krita_Painting posted the following tweet with a screenshot showing off the setting, which was enabled by default in her Adobe Creative Cloud account.
- Okay, we know... We made fun of Adobe when its cloud service went down. We've made fun of Corel Painter and Clip Studio. We joined in the protest No AI Generated Images protest. We made our stance on NFT's clear. But this is beyond making fun of. This is EW! EW! EW! pic.twitter.com/40wBWYci7V
- This setting, which appears to be on by default for all Creative Cloud subscribers, allows Adobe to perform content analysis on ‘Creative Cloud and Document Cloud content includ[ing] but [not] limited to image, audio, video, text or document files, and associated data.’ Adobe says in its Content analysis FAQ that files stored locally on your device are not analysed or processed.
- As for how Adobe analyzes content, the company says it ‘first aggregate[s] [users'] content with other content and then use[s] the aggregated content to train our algorithms and thus improve our products and services.’ In other words, Adobe is taking users' media, putting it into a training set used to teach its machine learning features, then bulk processing it.
- Adobe says ‘insights obtained through content analysis will not be used to re-create your content or lead to identifying any personal information’ and notes no ‘content is included in our products or services unless you make them public (for example, contributions to Adobe Stock and Behance).’ But that's not exactly the case, as there are a handful of exceptions that allows Adobe to access content from users' Creative Cloud libraries, such as participating in Adobe's Photoshop Improvement Program, Adobe Stock and 'Certain beta, prerelease, or early access products or features.'
- There’s also the possibility that users' content is manually reviewed by people ‘for product improvement and development purposes’ in select circumstances. If users' content is made public through Adobe Stock, Behance, live-streamed with Adobe Live, submitted to be a feature on Adobe Express or submitted as a tutorial in Lightroom, Adobe gives itself permission to manually review users' content, with seemingly little restrictions on what can be manually reviewed by humans. Users' content can also be manually reviewed if they’re using a pre-release, beta or early access program.
- This means humans within Adobe (or contracted personnel) could possibly review sensitive media from users' Creative Cloud files, should a user fall within one of the categories of exceptions mentioned above and on Adobe’s Content Analysis FAQ page. This clearly causes concern for photographers and other creatives whose media involves more sensitive imagery.
- Considering that the content analysis program appears to be something Creative Cloud users were automatically enrolled in, creatives from around the world could be unwittingly subjecting their clients and subjects to having another algorithm or human look at images that both parties thought were protected and shielded from anyone other than the consenting parties. It’s clear how this could turn into a privacy nightmare, should someone at Adobe misuse the images they come across or otherwise make private images public.
- Even with those explainers from the FAQ page, Adobe never explicitly states what exactly it’s doing with the media taken from its users, instead skirting the topic by explaining what machine learning is and how exactly the company uses machine learning in its AI-powered tools. Below is the relevant section in the company’s Content analysis FAQ webpage:
- ‘Adobe primarily uses machine learning in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud to analyze your content. Machine learning describes a subset of artificial intelligence in which a computing system uses algorithms to analyze and learn from data without human intervention to draw inferences from patterns and make predictions. The system may continue to learn and improve over time as it receives more data.’ The FAQ page then goes on to push the benefits AI-powered tools afford Creative Cloud users and details various examples of how Adobe’s AI features in Lightroom, Photoshop and more.
- The privacy concerns surrounding this program should be evident. All it takes is a rogue employee or contractor to misuse private images that Creative Cloud users keep in what is believed to be a private Creative Cloud account to run into all kinds of issues.
- For now, you can opt out by logging into your Adobe account, tapping on your profile photo in the top-right-hand corner of Adobe’s website, clicking ‘View Account,’ tapping ‘Edit Profile’ under your profile picture, going to ‘Privacy and personal data’ in the left-hand sidebar, then scrolling down to ‘Content analysis’ to turn off the automatic feature. Below is a video walkthrough of the process:
- We’ve inquired with an Adobe representative for additional information to clarify some details and will update this article when we receive an informative response.
- Disappointed to read this but seems to be more and more cases like this coming out of the woodwork!
- "Adobe's 'Content analysis' program could be using your photos and video to train AI without your knowledge"
- no s..t sherlock. what do you think they have been doing with all data they already collect from cloud base services etc so far? it's a rhetorical question..
- People should be able to opt out - but then the AI features should be automatically disabled too. I think....
- In NFT farming, users can use their NFTs to earn rewards in the form of new NFTs, tokens, other cryptocurrencies, or other digital assets. Rewards are earned by providing liquidity, staking NFTs, or trading them on exchanges. Liquidity is provided by users who deposit their NFTs into a liquidity pool, where they are then exchanged against other tokens like Ethereum or stablecoins. Staking involves users locking up their NFTs in order to receive rewards, while trading them requires users to actively trade their NFT https://blog.alphaguilty.io/nft-farming  on exchanges. NFT farming is a growing trend in the blockchain space and more dApps are now offering NFT farming as a part of their services. The rewards earned depend on the type of NFTs and the platform used for the farming. It is an exciting way for users to get involved in the blockchain space and earn rewards for their involvement.
- these fear mongering 'reports' are hilarious. it always ends on some note about how some random rogue employee could steal all your stuffs!
- Suppose your image itself contains something that should not be made public -- confidential financial records, for example?  That's definitely something that should not be manually reviewed by somebody.
- It would be interesting to know what DPReview’s owner, Amazon, is doing with files that are on AWS.
- 13 Jan, I just logged into my account and this setting was turned on. Good thing I've never uploaded any assets to the Adobe cloud. Now switched off.
- .
- Maybe Adobe just changed it, but when I checked just now (for the first time) on my account the setting was turned off.
- Good article.  Thank you!
- Something not everyone knows: content used for Machine Learning is always checked by humans, because you don't want to feed wrong information to the algorithm. It's guaranteed that there's a team at Adobe whose responsibility is to verify those millions of images coming from the users. They use an AI classifier to save time and then manually verify those images. Those images can then be used to train a system akin to Midjourney and you can bet Adobe is going to release a competing product soon, and thanks to us, the development costs have been reduced drastically.
- Still on Photoshop CS6 on my Windows PC (even if, sadly, no longer on my Mac). And sticking there, thanks. MY photos belong to ME, and live on MY hard drives and backup units. The "Cloud" can French Connection U.K. orph so far as I am concerned.
- There is no "cloud," it is just someone else's computer.
- Is this even legal? I mean, is Adobe under the threat of a global class action because of this? I cannot believe this can go unpunished.
- Adobe, like all other data leeches, writes things in their Terms of Service or Terms of Use that makes it "legal" until someone, such as the FTC, comes along and tells them it's not legal. After which a fine is imposed, probably around 1-2% of the money they gained by the illegal action. And then they sign a paper stating they did nothing wrong.
- I'm pretty sure it's not legal in the EU at least, and I just checked my account: t's set to "off", and I have no memory of opting out. It probably has to be opt-in in the EU.
- Well I do not remember ever changing it, but this setting was Off when I took a look at my Cc account online.
- I'm not a fan of Adobe, but I really wonder if this setting will lead to any harm to anybody.
- More important is the use of this practice by software companies in more serious cases, like Bitdefender who automatically subscribed me to their service for an extra year because I did not untick a pre-ticked box on their website when I subscribed for one year. Imagine my surprise when an amount of money just disappeared from my account a year later. Took quite a bit of back and forth with them to recover my money.
- I doubt having the setting to on would do any harm, but you never know. I went in & turned it off anyway. It's one less outfit poking around inside my computer. The worst part is they don't ask you up front if they can use it, they sneak in in when you're not looking.
- They're not poking around in your computer, they're poking around in your files that you've put on their computer.
- HAHAHAHA
- This is very simple: I want to use Adobe product - I pay for this, and pay a lot (I own full CC license).Adobe wants to use my product - they have to pay for this. They are not charity, I am not interested in making donations to them.
- "We’ve inquired with an Adobe representative for additional information to clarify some details and will update this article when we receive an informative response."How about waiting for the response before publishing? The assumptions, and possibilities presented have already done damage, and provided the expected response. Is this responsible journalism?
- Bernstein and Woodward should have waited for a response to Watergate from the U.S government before publishing too. Reckless irresponsible journalism will be the downfall of us all.
- This is not political so Eric's inquiry is valid.
- It's one way ticket. Even with official commentary, denial and even removal of the particular tick-box you never will be sure CC (substitute Apple, Meta etc.) is not scanning and AI-'analyzing' your personal content.
- @Eric: I waited 24 hours after emailing them before posting this article. That’s ample time to respond to such an inquiry. Also, contacting them is more a formality in this situation, considering the facts of the matter are laid out directly on Adobe’s own FAQ page. The only major questions are when this went into effect (a detail that, while notable, doesn’t negate the need to make this PSA to the public) and what exactly Adobe is using customers’ content for, both of which are questions I’m actively trying to gain clarity on. In this situation, we don’t need Adobe to verify that this program is up and running – it is, and Adobe lays out enough details on its own website to confirm users’ content is being used to train its own algorithms for its own gain.
- Thanks for the detailed reply, Gannon. "and what exactly Adobe is using customers’ content for," seems the only major question, here, and I still see nothing but speculation -much of which supports the "evil software mavens" trope."Adobe lays out enough details on its own website to confirm users’ content is being used to train its own algorithms for its own gain."And for the *user's* gain. How else would they train the algorithms efficiently?The idea that somehow a software manufacturer "owes" clients by using usage data, and other data, to improve a program, particularly in ways *requested by the clients* seems absurd, to me. Is there the potential for misusing the customer data? You bet... but that doesn't mean the data automatically *has or will* been misused, unless you subscribe to the idea that all corporations are evil by design, another absurdity. Cont....
- Cont...Hopefully more information is coming, from Adobe.Btw, I notice you removed the post that was somewhat supportive of my viewpoint.
- Re: What exactly adobe is doing:
- Adobe says enough to know that they’re using it to make their products better at the expense of users privacy, considering many users aren’t aware this setting is turned on.
- ’And for the *user's gain. How else would they train the algorithms efficiently?’*
- It’s also for their future financial gain. They could train algorithms using openly-available Creative Commons (licenses that allow for this) and Public Domain images. Alternatively, Adobe could pay for a set of images rather than sneakily scraping it from their users (again, without many of the users knowing they’re doing so). Lastly, Adobe could put out a very clear prompt asking users to submit their images to be used, as a very explicit opt-in, rather than it clearly being done in an opt-out fashion.
- ’The idea that somehow a software manufacturer "owes" clients by using usage data, and other data, to improve a program, particularly in ways *requested by the clients seems absurd, to me.’*
- This isn’t ‘usage data’ though. These are images, videos, audio and other types of content. I’m not sure it’s fair to lump this and ‘usage data’ into the same argument.
- @Gannon: " Adobe could put out a very clear prompt asking users to submit their images to be used, as a very explicit opt-in, rather than it clearly being done in an opt-out fashion."I have no argument with this, though, frankly, I suspect there were checkboxes when I first subscribed. I can't remember. I haven't installed a program in decades that didn't have a vague request for "data on user patterns" or somesuch, and it's likely the Adobe request was suitably vague.My question remains what data is being used, and for what...and we still do not know.
- @Eric on the topic of posts disappearing, seems to be a thing lately, a few comments debating dpreview's specific articles have completely disappeared lately
- @ViralTrendsTodayBizarrely, that comment, and another below it, is back.To avoid sounding like a crank, I will let it go at that...
- Being a long time Adobe CC user, I disabled it the minute I discovered this option, thanks for the article.
- I'm a long time CC user as well, and when I checked my settings as per this article I found that I had disabled content analysis years ago. It must have looked fishy to me back then. You should ALWAYS got through the privacy/security options for any OS or application.
- I probably did not care before because I've never used their cloud storage, but totally agree - you privacy is your responsibility, and better overdo than underdo.
- "Adobe says in its Content analysis FAQ that files stored locally on your device are not analysed or processed."Who believes that? Weren't there enough big companies in the past where later a whoopsie was discovered that they did for years they told they're not doing and just claim then it was a software bug?
- If Adobe (or anyone else) were looking at files on your computer you'd see a lot of internet activity, and your anti-virus/anti-malware software might actually bring that to your attention. Or you might even notice that your internet connection was getting slow due to that activity slowing down normal internet access.
- @ArthurSNo, you wouldn't. antivirus software also doesn't bring lightroom to attention when you let it access thousands of photos to generate previews. So what should be different?
- Furthermore why should you see a lot of internet activity? AI models usually aren't trained at full resolution images and you don't need the full image as you train more for specific features which is a small crop of it so the ai can work with different images as well sharing similar features but in different distribution. So the interesting parts are more convolution results and other condensed data.
- @PredatorsPrey - I suppose you'd expect to see some amount of internet traffic (particularly upload traffic) from Lightroom or Photoshop if it's sending cropped or downsized images to Adobe's servers for AI training. I'd also agree it's likely not going to be a ton of traffic as they can probably get away with very compressed JPGs and there's no requirement to upload every image in your library.
- @ArthurS Yeah, right. My 80 year old mother would have flagged that immediately.
- You guys are sure there is nothing hidden in the traffic, as example of LogTransporter2 or the licence checker or what else sends data to adobe? Sometimes its in the region of megabytes. It might happen right now or in some time but thus statements and actions from other big companies in the past have shown what they're going to do. Learn from the past, don't repeat the same mistakes like falling for the same trick the 20th time. Don't be as stubborn and naive as with their standalone version statement.
- As they once sang:
- 'Hey, hey - You, you - Get off of my cloud!
- Hey, hey - You, you - Get off of my cloud!'
- I am very happy with the Adobe image processing products ( (The current Photography Plan: Lightroom Classic, ACR, Bridge, and Photoshop, but I never use the mobile and Adobe Cloud storage aspects of those programs. Too much chance for mishagosh.
- But I am a one man and occasionally the leader of a three man band. If I was an employee of a large corporation and needed to share assets across the org, I am sure it would be one of the cloud asset programs we’d be evaluating
- I should imagine I could bill them a monthly consulting fee for leaving it on?
- yes. imagine away.
- I’m sorry - which emoji am I supposed to use for “It simply is what it is”?
- 🤷🏻‍♂️
- @Gannon: If you don't know, just say so!!  (J-O-K-E!!!)
- Hungry capitalist pig emoji
- "It’s been discovered that Adobe has automatically opted users" lol, but of course they have. They are Borg, they think the world is Borg. The individual or its rights do not matter.
- I assume this information is being used to improve masking and similar tools.
- Good.
- Adobe already has access to millions of images to improve masking etc. No what Adobe is doing is using our images for their own benefit because nobody gets paid by Adobe for using our images. If your happy to give your work away that's fine.. BUT many people don't agree that giving image use away is good for any content creator
- As I said, if it improves their product, then fine.
- Adobe might have access to millions of images, but are those images everyday scenes, warts and all, or just technically perfect library stock - surely the more variety quality wise of image sampled the more versatile the finished tool?
- Your missing the point. It’s the slippery slope of saying use anything I upload for your own use. Just a further degradation of the photographers right to control their image.
- So you would also be fine with it if I use your photos as I want and you gain back exposure with your name printed in 3pt?
- I would be fine with it if it werent on the exploiting others for profit so those of which photos are used for a commercial product without licensing/payment should at least get access to the product for free. That would just be fair.
- Are all Adobe haters who don't use Adobe products but love to vent their spleen at every opportunity present and accounted for? Gentlemen, start your little engines!
- So someone who decided to not use Adobe products for a reason, which might or might not be based on previous experience with Adobe products, has no right to publicly discuss that reason without being ridiculed?
- I'm generally a fan of Adobe, my daughter worked for them for awhile and a friend of mine used to be a director there, but a good company would have made this an opt in and asked everyone to join.
- That doesn't mean that Adobe is evil but it does mean that they should be critiqued in this case.
- Adobe and shady business practices - name a more iconic duo. I purged Adobe malware from all my devices long ago (not that they make that easy). Now I couldn't be happier with imatch, affinity, and DXO.
- Not sure if it's my reading comprehension lacking or yours, but you are not making a lot of sense.
- It would have been surprising if it didn't. No company that is able to collect data cares about your privacy, period. Everything  else is fake virtue signalling.
- Read the terms and conditions on when the content is used in this context, it is when you have shared your content for collaborations or in streams that are distributed via Adobe tools. Your normal cloud storage is not used. Typical storm in a water bottle type of post from someone not too concerned about posting FUD it seems...
- So is your argument that - if your interpretation is correct - that they are not taking all the content, just some of it, and that's OK?
- Have you seen the estimates of how long it would take a person to read all the T&C and policies that online accounts impose on their subscribers?
- @charlyw64: That's not the only time they use your content. As I explained in the article above, there are other times when Adobe reserves the right to use your cloud content. Here is the full list of reasons, as provided by Adobe on its FAQ page.
- And beyond that, there are exceptions where even if you opt out, they still reserve the rights to use your images.
- Your point, Gannon, is a good one.  It's not until you read the FAQ page that you recognize that what they say in their terms and conditions is not what those words would commonly be understood to mean.  As a lawyer I wouldn't want anyone at Adobe manually looking at my images.  While I don't store any images in Adobe's cloud, I only want people who I intend to view my images to view them.  Not because a company slyly gives their employees that right.
- You really need to read those terms and conditions without your tin foil conspiracy hat. Those are laid out by lawyers - and clearly state that only material you make public or explicitly accessible for their benefit will be used. You falsely assume malice on their part... And if you are so certain that these terms are illegal, put your money where your mouth is and have a lawyer scrutiny them.
- @charleyw64 - Rather than your ad hominem "arguments", it'd be great if you responded to my questions - I made no statement of my views at all.
- @charlyw64: As RamD notes, the T&Cs don’t necessarily lay out in plain language what exactly Adobe is doing with your data. That legalise is specifically written by lawyers to cover the company’s interests while being as obscure as possible. Thankfully, Adobe states in more plain language what they’re doing with the content on their FAQ page. And even then, it’s not 100% clear (I’m still actively in discussions with an Adobe representative to get even clearer definitions on what customers’ content is being used for). The T&Cs cover Adobe’s legal bases, it doesn’t necessarily state what they’re doing with the images behind the scenes. T&Cs might say a company reserves the right do use your images – it doesn’t say what they will do with your images.
- .Next thing you know, they will be taking the monthlysubscription for their suite of Apps, without approval.🤣I photograph, therefore I Photoshop!
- LOL!
- I swear its coming next. All freedoms are under attack.
- I doubt the setting matters if you're worried about a disgruntled, malicious or just bored employee.  That sort of person doesn't care about your permission.
- Are they just looking at the images or are they also looking at the keywords?
- I'd think the bigger issue is for working pros. Would your insurance cover you if a client image got misused?
- Isn't this a REALLY old issue? When I switched to Adobe Cloud years ago (at least three yrs...) the "Content analysis"-switch was on as well. I didn't want my content to be analyzed and so I switched it off. You just have to read the fine print, before you play with software... If there is something to complain about it's the default setting, but, hey, almost every software company sets up their products like this (hidden in phrases like "help to improve the customer experience" or similar).
- Same here, Michael. The "content analysis" switch is not new. I turned off that switch and the nearby "desktop app usage" switch years ago, during registration.
- Forgive me - but why exactly is this a problem❓
- Depends on what you're worried about.
- There have been cases that models posed for stock images and the advertising the image got used in wasn't very flattering or worse. Those models made a few $$ but ended up with real life problems.
- If you take portraits you might be held responsible if the images get out.
- You carry your forum name right .. don’t you..
- Sorry - not sure who or what you mean....❓
- "The protagonist of the novel, Candide is a good-hearted but hopelessly naïve young man."
- Fair enough - but what exactly is the problem❓
- Oh - I understand the point from gaul now - add thick to naive….🤦‍♂️
- Ask Greg Rutkowski.
- So to confirm when they say creative cloud files does that include all our photos in Lightroom cloud library. Or is it just creative cloud documents.
- The relevant content must have been shred through one of their collaboration sites, or used for some public uses already, so your cloud files are not affected unless you used those additional services. Storm in a water glass type of scare mongering post,
- AI is already using any of your image online as reference anyway.
- Online …
- Adobe Cloud customers now aware that their precious pictures stored in Adobe’s private Cloud is effectively..online..
- Not for me, what a shame Adobe
- Surprise surprise. I’ve never trusted any cloud storage and that includes Google, Apple and Adobe.
- Agreed 👍🏻
- Serves us right as a reminder this shameful behaviour by Adobe
- BEWARE ADOBE! I so not trust you I have mirrored my full workflow with Photo Supreme (iDimager) and the full suite of DxO … Have been preparing for 2 yr now the moment I will have to shut you down!You are not too big to fail! You have been warned!Really does not go down well with me these secret spying manners… Gaul
- Like every place that offers you cloud storage.
- This isn’t new or unique, we were even throwing a fuss when apple was going to do it before sending stuff to the cloud “to protect the children”
- Dystopian stuff
- Shameful nonetheless
- Another reason I'm glad I'm still using good old CS6.
- Using adobe cc doesn’t force you to place your work on the adobe cloud storage system.
- I have not trusted them for years so never thought for a second about saving anything to their cloud. No surprises here at least to me. NOT trustworthy in any way.
- Why don't they have an AI feature to edit my photos while I sleep?
- Even better take pictures for me and edit them while I do smth else.
- Did anyone actually expect anything better of Adobe?
- Does the checkbox actually work? No way to know I guess
- There are probably some lawyers in the DPReview community.  Any chance Adobe's actions are illegal?  IP theft? Contract manipulation? How is this switch-and-bait con legal?
- They probably updated their service agreement a while back to include a clause through which you grant them the right to do this if you accept the new service agreement.
- The IT world is effectively lawless.  By the time the legal system catches up, they have provided for fines, banked their profits, and are off on the next dubious venture.
- Brilliant...I'm looking forward to seeing the implementation and how far they can take it.
- Appalling, but sadly, not in the slightest surprising.
- haha - DUH!!!!
- Many people have heard 'when something is free, you are the product'.
- More and more, it is 'when you pay for something, you are still the product'.  Granted, this is what pay TV always way (paying a ton of money...to have commercials), but for me the whole point of paying for a service is to have the service work for me.
- I am in the USA and this was enabled when I checked.
- I'm in Australia.  Mine was enabled too.  I've just switched it off.I'd be interested to see if they had the balls to do it in Europe too.  Europeans are very touchy about this sort of thing.
- I live in Belgium (Europe) and it was on.
- Excited for the final frontier: "When you never even used the software, you're still the product"

- If you’re an Adobe Creative Cloud subscriber, you might want to go and turn off a new setting immediately. It’s been discovered that Adobe has automatically opted users into a ‘Content analysis’ program that allows Adobe to analyze your media files in Creative Cloud for use in its machine learning training programs.
- It's unclear when exactly this program and setting went into effect, but it became widely noticed after Twitter user Krita_Painting posted the following tweet with a screenshot showing off the setting, which was enabled by default in her Adobe Creative Cloud account.
- Okay, we know... We made fun of Adobe when its cloud service went down. We've made fun of Corel Painter and Clip Studio. We joined in the protest No AI Generated Images protest. We made our stance on NFT's clear. But this is beyond making fun of. This is EW! EW! EW! pic.twitter.com/40wBWYci7V
- This setting, which appears to be on by default for all Creative Cloud subscribers, allows Adobe to perform content analysis on ‘Creative Cloud and Document Cloud content includ[ing] but [not] limited to image, audio, video, text or document files, and associated data.’ Adobe says in its Content analysis FAQ that files stored locally on your device are not analysed or processed.
- As for how Adobe analyzes content, the company says it ‘first aggregate[s] [users'] content with other content and then use[s] the aggregated content to train our algorithms and thus improve our products and services.’ In other words, Adobe is taking users' media, putting it into a training set used to teach its machine learning features, then bulk processing it.
- Adobe says ‘insights obtained through content analysis will not be used to re-create your content or lead to identifying any personal information’ and notes no ‘content is included in our products or services unless you make them public (for example, contributions to Adobe Stock and Behance).’ But that's not exactly the case, as there are a handful of exceptions that allows Adobe to access content from users' Creative Cloud libraries, such as participating in Adobe's Photoshop Improvement Program, Adobe Stock and 'Certain beta, prerelease, or early access products or features.'
- There’s also the possibility that users' content is manually reviewed by people ‘for product improvement and development purposes’ in select circumstances. If users' content is made public through Adobe Stock, Behance, live-streamed with Adobe Live, submitted to be a feature on Adobe Express or submitted as a tutorial in Lightroom, Adobe gives itself permission to manually review users' content, with seemingly little restrictions on what can be manually reviewed by humans. Users' content can also be manually reviewed if they’re using a pre-release, beta or early access program.
- This means humans within Adobe (or contracted personnel) could possibly review sensitive media from users' Creative Cloud files, should a user fall within one of the categories of exceptions mentioned above and on Adobe’s Content Analysis FAQ page. This clearly causes concern for photographers and other creatives whose media involves more sensitive imagery.
- Considering that the content analysis program appears to be something Creative Cloud users were automatically enrolled in, creatives from around the world could be unwittingly subjecting their clients and subjects to having another algorithm or human look at images that both parties thought were protected and shielded from anyone other than the consenting parties. It’s clear how this could turn into a privacy nightmare, should someone at Adobe misuse the images they come across or otherwise make private images public.
- Even with those explainers from the FAQ page, Adobe never explicitly states what exactly it’s doing with the media taken from its users, instead skirting the topic by explaining what machine learning is and how exactly the company uses machine learning in its AI-powered tools. Below is the relevant section in the company’s Content analysis FAQ webpage:
- ‘Adobe primarily uses machine learning in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud to analyze your content. Machine learning describes a subset of artificial intelligence in which a computing system uses algorithms to analyze and learn from data without human intervention to draw inferences from patterns and make predictions. The system may continue to learn and improve over time as it receives more data.’ The FAQ page then goes on to push the benefits AI-powered tools afford Creative Cloud users and details various examples of how Adobe’s AI features in Lightroom, Photoshop and more.
- The privacy concerns surrounding this program should be evident. All it takes is a rogue employee or contractor to misuse private images that Creative Cloud users keep in what is believed to be a private Creative Cloud account to run into all kinds of issues.
- For now, you can opt out by logging into your Adobe account, tapping on your profile photo in the top-right-hand corner of Adobe’s website, clicking ‘View Account,’ tapping ‘Edit Profile’ under your profile picture, going to ‘Privacy and personal data’ in the left-hand sidebar, then scrolling down to ‘Content analysis’ to turn off the automatic feature. Below is a video walkthrough of the process:
- We’ve inquired with an Adobe representative for additional information to clarify some details and will update this article when we receive an informative response.
- Disappointed to read this but seems to be more and more cases like this coming out of the woodwork!
- "Adobe's 'Content analysis' program could be using your photos and video to train AI without your knowledge"
- no s..t sherlock. what do you think they have been doing with all data they already collect from cloud base services etc so far? it's a rhetorical question..
- People should be able to opt out - but then the AI features should be automatically disabled too. I think....
- In NFT farming, users can use their NFTs to earn rewards in the form of new NFTs, tokens, other cryptocurrencies, or other digital assets. Rewards are earned by providing liquidity, staking NFTs, or trading them on exchanges. Liquidity is provided by users who deposit their NFTs into a liquidity pool, where they are then exchanged against other tokens like Ethereum or stablecoins. Staking involves users locking up their NFTs in order to receive rewards, while trading them requires users to actively trade their NFT https://blog.alphaguilty.io/nft-farming  on exchanges. NFT farming is a growing trend in the blockchain space and more dApps are now offering NFT farming as a part of their services. The rewards earned depend on the type of NFTs and the platform used for the farming. It is an exciting way for users to get involved in the blockchain space and earn rewards for their involvement.
- these fear mongering 'reports' are hilarious. it always ends on some note about how some random rogue employee could steal all your stuffs!
- Suppose your image itself contains something that should not be made public -- confidential financial records, for example?  That's definitely something that should not be manually reviewed by somebody.
- It would be interesting to know what DPReview’s owner, Amazon, is doing with files that are on AWS.
- 13 Jan, I just logged into my account and this setting was turned on. Good thing I've never uploaded any assets to the Adobe cloud. Now switched off.
- .
- Maybe Adobe just changed it, but when I checked just now (for the first time) on my account the setting was turned off.
- Good article.  Thank you!
- Something not everyone knows: content used for Machine Learning is always checked by humans, because you don't want to feed wrong information to the algorithm. It's guaranteed that there's a team at Adobe whose responsibility is to verify those millions of images coming from the users. They use an AI classifier to save time and then manually verify those images. Those images can then be used to train a system akin to Midjourney and you can bet Adobe is going to release a competing product soon, and thanks to us, the development costs have been reduced drastically.
- Still on Photoshop CS6 on my Windows PC (even if, sadly, no longer on my Mac). And sticking there, thanks. MY photos belong to ME, and live on MY hard drives and backup units. The "Cloud" can French Connection U.K. orph so far as I am concerned.
- There is no "cloud," it is just someone else's computer.
- Is this even legal? I mean, is Adobe under the threat of a global class action because of this? I cannot believe this can go unpunished.
- Adobe, like all other data leeches, writes things in their Terms of Service or Terms of Use that makes it "legal" until someone, such as the FTC, comes along and tells them it's not legal. After which a fine is imposed, probably around 1-2% of the money they gained by the illegal action. And then they sign a paper stating they did nothing wrong.
- I'm pretty sure it's not legal in the EU at least, and I just checked my account: t's set to "off", and I have no memory of opting out. It probably has to be opt-in in the EU.
- Well I do not remember ever changing it, but this setting was Off when I took a look at my Cc account online.
- I'm not a fan of Adobe, but I really wonder if this setting will lead to any harm to anybody.
- More important is the use of this practice by software companies in more serious cases, like Bitdefender who automatically subscribed me to their service for an extra year because I did not untick a pre-ticked box on their website when I subscribed for one year. Imagine my surprise when an amount of money just disappeared from my account a year later. Took quite a bit of back and forth with them to recover my money.
- I doubt having the setting to on would do any harm, but you never know. I went in & turned it off anyway. It's one less outfit poking around inside my computer. The worst part is they don't ask you up front if they can use it, they sneak in in when you're not looking.
- They're not poking around in your computer, they're poking around in your files that you've put on their computer.
- HAHAHAHA
- This is very simple: I want to use Adobe product - I pay for this, and pay a lot (I own full CC license).Adobe wants to use my product - they have to pay for this. They are not charity, I am not interested in making donations to them.
- "We’ve inquired with an Adobe representative for additional information to clarify some details and will update this article when we receive an informative response."How about waiting for the response before publishing? The assumptions, and possibilities presented have already done damage, and provided the expected response. Is this responsible journalism?
- Bernstein and Woodward should have waited for a response to Watergate from the U.S government before publishing too. Reckless irresponsible journalism will be the downfall of us all.
- This is not political so Eric's inquiry is valid.
- It's one way ticket. Even with official commentary, denial and even removal of the particular tick-box you never will be sure CC (substitute Apple, Meta etc.) is not scanning and AI-'analyzing' your personal content.
- @Eric: I waited 24 hours after emailing them before posting this article. That’s ample time to respond to such an inquiry. Also, contacting them is more a formality in this situation, considering the facts of the matter are laid out directly on Adobe’s own FAQ page. The only major questions are when this went into effect (a detail that, while notable, doesn’t negate the need to make this PSA to the public) and what exactly Adobe is using customers’ content for, both of which are questions I’m actively trying to gain clarity on. In this situation, we don’t need Adobe to verify that this program is up and running – it is, and Adobe lays out enough details on its own website to confirm users’ content is being used to train its own algorithms for its own gain.
- Thanks for the detailed reply, Gannon. "and what exactly Adobe is using customers’ content for," seems the only major question, here, and I still see nothing but speculation -much of which supports the "evil software mavens" trope."Adobe lays out enough details on its own website to confirm users’ content is being used to train its own algorithms for its own gain."And for the *user's* gain. How else would they train the algorithms efficiently?The idea that somehow a software manufacturer "owes" clients by using usage data, and other data, to improve a program, particularly in ways *requested by the clients* seems absurd, to me. Is there the potential for misusing the customer data? You bet... but that doesn't mean the data automatically *has or will* been misused, unless you subscribe to the idea that all corporations are evil by design, another absurdity. Cont....
- Cont...Hopefully more information is coming, from Adobe.Btw, I notice you removed the post that was somewhat supportive of my viewpoint.
- Re: What exactly adobe is doing:
- Adobe says enough to know that they’re using it to make their products better at the expense of users privacy, considering many users aren’t aware this setting is turned on.
- ’And for the *user's gain. How else would they train the algorithms efficiently?’*
- It’s also for their future financial gain. They could train algorithms using openly-available Creative Commons (licenses that allow for this) and Public Domain images. Alternatively, Adobe could pay for a set of images rather than sneakily scraping it from their users (again, without many of the users knowing they’re doing so). Lastly, Adobe could put out a very clear prompt asking users to submit their images to be used, as a very explicit opt-in, rather than it clearly being done in an opt-out fashion.
- ’The idea that somehow a software manufacturer "owes" clients by using usage data, and other data, to improve a program, particularly in ways *requested by the clients seems absurd, to me.’*
- This isn’t ‘usage data’ though. These are images, videos, audio and other types of content. I’m not sure it’s fair to lump this and ‘usage data’ into the same argument.
- @Gannon: " Adobe could put out a very clear prompt asking users to submit their images to be used, as a very explicit opt-in, rather than it clearly being done in an opt-out fashion."I have no argument with this, though, frankly, I suspect there were checkboxes when I first subscribed. I can't remember. I haven't installed a program in decades that didn't have a vague request for "data on user patterns" or somesuch, and it's likely the Adobe request was suitably vague.My question remains what data is being used, and for what...and we still do not know.
- @Eric on the topic of posts disappearing, seems to be a thing lately, a few comments debating dpreview's specific articles have completely disappeared lately
- @ViralTrendsTodayBizarrely, that comment, and another below it, is back.To avoid sounding like a crank, I will let it go at that...
- Being a long time Adobe CC user, I disabled it the minute I discovered this option, thanks for the article.
- I'm a long time CC user as well, and when I checked my settings as per this article I found that I had disabled content analysis years ago. It must have looked fishy to me back then. You should ALWAYS got through the privacy/security options for any OS or application.
- I probably did not care before because I've never used their cloud storage, but totally agree - you privacy is your responsibility, and better overdo than underdo.
- "Adobe says in its Content analysis FAQ that files stored locally on your device are not analysed or processed."Who believes that? Weren't there enough big companies in the past where later a whoopsie was discovered that they did for years they told they're not doing and just claim then it was a software bug?
- If Adobe (or anyone else) were looking at files on your computer you'd see a lot of internet activity, and your anti-virus/anti-malware software might actually bring that to your attention. Or you might even notice that your internet connection was getting slow due to that activity slowing down normal internet access.
- @ArthurSNo, you wouldn't. antivirus software also doesn't bring lightroom to attention when you let it access thousands of photos to generate previews. So what should be different?
- Furthermore why should you see a lot of internet activity? AI models usually aren't trained at full resolution images and you don't need the full image as you train more for specific features which is a small crop of it so the ai can work with different images as well sharing similar features but in different distribution. So the interesting parts are more convolution results and other condensed data.
- @PredatorsPrey - I suppose you'd expect to see some amount of internet traffic (particularly upload traffic) from Lightroom or Photoshop if it's sending cropped or downsized images to Adobe's servers for AI training. I'd also agree it's likely not going to be a ton of traffic as they can probably get away with very compressed JPGs and there's no requirement to upload every image in your library.
- @ArthurS Yeah, right. My 80 year old mother would have flagged that immediately.
- You guys are sure there is nothing hidden in the traffic, as example of LogTransporter2 or the licence checker or what else sends data to adobe? Sometimes its in the region of megabytes. It might happen right now or in some time but thus statements and actions from other big companies in the past have shown what they're going to do. Learn from the past, don't repeat the same mistakes like falling for the same trick the 20th time. Don't be as stubborn and naive as with their standalone version statement.
- As they once sang:
- 'Hey, hey - You, you - Get off of my cloud!
- Hey, hey - You, you - Get off of my cloud!'
- I am very happy with the Adobe image processing products ( (The current Photography Plan: Lightroom Classic, ACR, Bridge, and Photoshop, but I never use the mobile and Adobe Cloud storage aspects of those programs. Too much chance for mishagosh.
- But I am a one man and occasionally the leader of a three man band. If I was an employee of a large corporation and needed to share assets across the org, I am sure it would be one of the cloud asset programs we’d be evaluating
- I should imagine I could bill them a monthly consulting fee for leaving it on?
- yes. imagine away.
- I’m sorry - which emoji am I supposed to use for “It simply is what it is”?
- 🤷🏻‍♂️
- @Gannon: If you don't know, just say so!!  (J-O-K-E!!!)
- Hungry capitalist pig emoji
- "It’s been discovered that Adobe has automatically opted users" lol, but of course they have. They are Borg, they think the world is Borg. The individual or its rights do not matter.
- I assume this information is being used to improve masking and similar tools.
- Good.
- Adobe already has access to millions of images to improve masking etc. No what Adobe is doing is using our images for their own benefit because nobody gets paid by Adobe for using our images. If your happy to give your work away that's fine.. BUT many people don't agree that giving image use away is good for any content creator
- As I said, if it improves their product, then fine.
- Adobe might have access to millions of images, but are those images everyday scenes, warts and all, or just technically perfect library stock - surely the more variety quality wise of image sampled the more versatile the finished tool?
- Your missing the point. It’s the slippery slope of saying use anything I upload for your own use. Just a further degradation of the photographers right to control their image.
- So you would also be fine with it if I use your photos as I want and you gain back exposure with your name printed in 3pt?
- I would be fine with it if it werent on the exploiting others for profit so those of which photos are used for a commercial product without licensing/payment should at least get access to the product for free. That would just be fair.
- Are all Adobe haters who don't use Adobe products but love to vent their spleen at every opportunity present and accounted for? Gentlemen, start your little engines!
- So someone who decided to not use Adobe products for a reason, which might or might not be based on previous experience with Adobe products, has no right to publicly discuss that reason without being ridiculed?
- I'm generally a fan of Adobe, my daughter worked for them for awhile and a friend of mine used to be a director there, but a good company would have made this an opt in and asked everyone to join.
- That doesn't mean that Adobe is evil but it does mean that they should be critiqued in this case.
- Adobe and shady business practices - name a more iconic duo. I purged Adobe malware from all my devices long ago (not that they make that easy). Now I couldn't be happier with imatch, affinity, and DXO.
- Not sure if it's my reading comprehension lacking or yours, but you are not making a lot of sense.
- It would have been surprising if it didn't. No company that is able to collect data cares about your privacy, period. Everything  else is fake virtue signalling.
- Read the terms and conditions on when the content is used in this context, it is when you have shared your content for collaborations or in streams that are distributed via Adobe tools. Your normal cloud storage is not used. Typical storm in a water bottle type of post from someone not too concerned about posting FUD it seems...
- So is your argument that - if your interpretation is correct - that they are not taking all the content, just some of it, and that's OK?
- Have you seen the estimates of how long it would take a person to read all the T&C and policies that online accounts impose on their subscribers?
- @charlyw64: That's not the only time they use your content. As I explained in the article above, there are other times when Adobe reserves the right to use your cloud content. Here is the full list of reasons, as provided by Adobe on its FAQ page.
- And beyond that, there are exceptions where even if you opt out, they still reserve the rights to use your images.
- Your point, Gannon, is a good one.  It's not until you read the FAQ page that you recognize that what they say in their terms and conditions is not what those words would commonly be understood to mean.  As a lawyer I wouldn't want anyone at Adobe manually looking at my images.  While I don't store any images in Adobe's cloud, I only want people who I intend to view my images to view them.  Not because a company slyly gives their employees that right.
- You really need to read those terms and conditions without your tin foil conspiracy hat. Those are laid out by lawyers - and clearly state that only material you make public or explicitly accessible for their benefit will be used. You falsely assume malice on their part... And if you are so certain that these terms are illegal, put your money where your mouth is and have a lawyer scrutiny them.
- @charleyw64 - Rather than your ad hominem "arguments", it'd be great if you responded to my questions - I made no statement of my views at all.
- @charlyw64: As RamD notes, the T&Cs don’t necessarily lay out in plain language what exactly Adobe is doing with your data. That legalise is specifically written by lawyers to cover the company’s interests while being as obscure as possible. Thankfully, Adobe states in more plain language what they’re doing with the content on their FAQ page. And even then, it’s not 100% clear (I’m still actively in discussions with an Adobe representative to get even clearer definitions on what customers’ content is being used for). The T&Cs cover Adobe’s legal bases, it doesn’t necessarily state what they’re doing with the images behind the scenes. T&Cs might say a company reserves the right do use your images – it doesn’t say what they will do with your images.
- .Next thing you know, they will be taking the monthlysubscription for their suite of Apps, without approval.🤣I photograph, therefore I Photoshop!
- LOL!
- I swear its coming next. All freedoms are under attack.
- I doubt the setting matters if you're worried about a disgruntled, malicious or just bored employee.  That sort of person doesn't care about your permission.
- Are they just looking at the images or are they also looking at the keywords?
- I'd think the bigger issue is for working pros. Would your insurance cover you if a client image got misused?
- Isn't this a REALLY old issue? When I switched to Adobe Cloud years ago (at least three yrs...) the "Content analysis"-switch was on as well. I didn't want my content to be analyzed and so I switched it off. You just have to read the fine print, before you play with software... If there is something to complain about it's the default setting, but, hey, almost every software company sets up their products like this (hidden in phrases like "help to improve the customer experience" or similar).
- Same here, Michael. The "content analysis" switch is not new. I turned off that switch and the nearby "desktop app usage" switch years ago, during registration.
- Forgive me - but why exactly is this a problem❓
- Depends on what you're worried about.
- There have been cases that models posed for stock images and the advertising the image got used in wasn't very flattering or worse. Those models made a few $$ but ended up with real life problems.
- If you take portraits you might be held responsible if the images get out.
- You carry your forum name right .. don’t you..
- Sorry - not sure who or what you mean....❓
- "The protagonist of the novel, Candide is a good-hearted but hopelessly naïve young man."
- Fair enough - but what exactly is the problem❓
- Oh - I understand the point from gaul now - add thick to naive….🤦‍♂️
- Ask Greg Rutkowski.
- So to confirm when they say creative cloud files does that include all our photos in Lightroom cloud library. Or is it just creative cloud documents.
- The relevant content must have been shred through one of their collaboration sites, or used for some public uses already, so your cloud files are not affected unless you used those additional services. Storm in a water glass type of scare mongering post,
- AI is already using any of your image online as reference anyway.
- Online …
- Adobe Cloud customers now aware that their precious pictures stored in Adobe’s private Cloud is effectively..online..
- Not for me, what a shame Adobe
- Surprise surprise. I’ve never trusted any cloud storage and that includes Google, Apple and Adobe.
- Agreed 👍🏻
- Serves us right as a reminder this shameful behaviour by Adobe
- BEWARE ADOBE! I so not trust you I have mirrored my full workflow with Photo Supreme (iDimager) and the full suite of DxO … Have been preparing for 2 yr now the moment I will have to shut you down!You are not too big to fail! You have been warned!Really does not go down well with me these secret spying manners… Gaul
- Like every place that offers you cloud storage.
- This isn’t new or unique, we were even throwing a fuss when apple was going to do it before sending stuff to the cloud “to protect the children”
- Dystopian stuff
- Shameful nonetheless
- Another reason I'm glad I'm still using good old CS6.
- Using adobe cc doesn’t force you to place your work on the adobe cloud storage system.
- I have not trusted them for years so never thought for a second about saving anything to their cloud. No surprises here at least to me. NOT trustworthy in any way.
- Why don't they have an AI feature to edit my photos while I sleep?
- Even better take pictures for me and edit them while I do smth else.
- Did anyone actually expect anything better of Adobe?
- Does the checkbox actually work? No way to know I guess
- There are probably some lawyers in the DPReview community.  Any chance Adobe's actions are illegal?  IP theft? Contract manipulation? How is this switch-and-bait con legal?
- They probably updated their service agreement a while back to include a clause through which you grant them the right to do this if you accept the new service agreement.
- The IT world is effectively lawless.  By the time the legal system catches up, they have provided for fines, banked their profits, and are off on the next dubious venture.
- Brilliant...I'm looking forward to seeing the implementation and how far they can take it.
- Appalling, but sadly, not in the slightest surprising.
- haha - DUH!!!!
- Many people have heard 'when something is free, you are the product'.
- More and more, it is 'when you pay for something, you are still the product'.  Granted, this is what pay TV always way (paying a ton of money...to have commercials), but for me the whole point of paying for a service is to have the service work for me.
- I am in the USA and this was enabled when I checked.
- I'm in Australia.  Mine was enabled too.  I've just switched it off.I'd be interested to see if they had the balls to do it in Europe too.  Europeans are very touchy about this sort of thing.
- I live in Belgium (Europe) and it was on.
- Excited for the final frontier: "When you never even used the software, you're still the product"
