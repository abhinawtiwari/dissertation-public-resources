- A Tesla Model 3 rear-ended a Kawasaki motorcycle in Boca Raton, Florida, in the middle of the night, throwing the biker from her seat into the Tesla's windshield. She died from her injuries at a nearby medical centre.
- According to CNN, the official report from the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office said the Tesla's Autopilot partially-automated driver assistance system was engaged. The driver, lawyer Richard Dorfman, was found to have been driving impaired at the time of the crash.
- The incident was the third in two months in which Teslas using Autopilot had hit motorbikes from behind and killed the riders.

- BOCA RATON, FL – Boca Post (BocaPost.com) — 51-year-old Ingrid Noon, of Boca Raton, dies after she was rear-ended by a high-speed Tesla driven by Rick Dorfman on Boca Rio Road in West Boca Raton early Friday morning.
- According to PBSO traffic homicide investigators, At approximately 2:11 AM, Ingrid was driving her Kawasaki Vulcan S westbound on SW 18th Street within the inner lane, approaching Boca Rio Road.
- At the same time, Richard Dorfman, 39, of Boca Raton, was driving a Tesla Model 3 behind Noon within the same lane of travel at a high rate of speed.
- Dorfman failed to observe Ingrid and impacted the rear of her motorcycle. The impact caused Ingrid to be thrown off the motorcycle and onto the Tesla’s windshield.
- Noon was transported to Delray Medical Center where she later died due to injuries sustained in the collision.
- Dorfman was transported by ground to Boca Regional Hospital after he claimed to have chest pains immediately after paramedics arrived.
- Sources close to the investigation tell Boca Post that the PBSO DUI unit followed Dorfman to the hospital. PBSO indicates that Dorfman may have been under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol and that charges for Dorfman are pending.
- Boca Post has learned that Dorfman is a member of The Florida Bar (Bar #125664), reportedly practicing law at The Law Office of Richard Dorfman, LLC. While Dorfman may still be legally eligible to practice law in Florida, he apparently traded law for lashes as he is a franchise owner of multiple “Deka Lash” locations, including one in Delray Beach.
- Charges have not yet been filed against Dorfman which is typical in these types of cases. It can many months for law enforcement and the state attorney to investigate and prepare the case for prosecution.
