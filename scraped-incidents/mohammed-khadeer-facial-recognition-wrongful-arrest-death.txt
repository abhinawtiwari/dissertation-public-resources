- Labourer Mohammed Khadeer, 35, was misidentified using facial recognition technology, illegally held and tortured by Medak police in Telangana state, India, for five days in connection with a chain-snatching case. He later died of his wounds.
- Khadeer had been picked up by police from Yakutpura in Hyderabad late January, apparently because his facial features matched with that of the culprit in the chain-snatching case.
- The incident sparked outrage amongst local politicians, human and civil rights activists, and the general public. Four police officers were later suspended from the Medak police, pending an investigation.
- Medak police had initially told the Times of India that they had questioned Khadeer and let him go.

- Activists decry the use of invasive surveillance tech, say usage is growing across many cities in India especially in Hyderabad without transparency and accountability.
- The death of 36-year-old daily wage labourer Khadeer Khan due to alleged custodial torture by the police in TelanganaŌĆÖs Medak district has raised questions about the reliability of the Telangana policeŌĆÖs much touted CCTV and face recognition systems. It has now emerged that Khadeer was wrongly identified and nabbed from Hyderabad on January 29 as there were similarities between him and a chain snatcher seen in CCTV footage in Medak. He was released five days later on February 3 and died while undergoing treatment in Hyderabad at the state-run Gandhi Hospital. In a video statement taken before his death, Khadeer had graphically described the torture inflicted on him.
- Activists believe that Khadeer paid with his life because of a tech failure after he was wrongly identified because of his similarities with the suspect. While it isnŌĆÖt fully clear whether facial recognition technology (FRT) was used in KhadeerŌĆÖs case, it is confirmed that he was identified using CCTV footage.
- While speaking to TNM, Medak Deputy Superintendent of Police K Saidulu had said that Khadeer was picked as there were similarities between him and the man seen in the CCTV footage snatching the chain. ŌĆ£When it was ruled out that Khadeer was not the one who had committed the crime, he was released. He was also produced in front of an Mandal Revenue Officer (MRO) before his release on February 3. Everything was done as per procedure,ŌĆØ the DSP had said.
- According to sources, the Telangana police has a digital database of nearly 40,000 persons who have been investigated in the past for a wide range of crimes in Hyderabad. The numbers will be much higher when the entire state is taken into account. According to the Medak police, Khadeer was involved in two property offences in 2018 and 2019. Property offences include offences like robbery, chain snatching, dacoity, extortion etc wherein a private property is involved.
- All police stations in Hyderabad use a face recognition app. Beat constables and police patrol vehicles are also provided with tabs that have the face recognition app installed in them. Speaking to TNM, a sub inspector, on the condition of anonymity said, ŌĆ£Everytime someone is remanded for an offence, their fingerprints are taken and photos from three sides are collected and entered into the database. Whenever CCTV footage or a photo is obtained, the cops run it through the app. The app compares the two images or videos and says what percentage of a match it is.ŌĆØ
- Such face recognition apps use biometric measurements for facial feature tracking on both images and videos. Some apps can also ascertain the emotional state of a suspect as well as establish their ethnicity. It can also track skin, hair, facial features and hairstyle. In KhadeerŌĆÖs case, his wife Farzana Khan while speaking to TNM earlier had said that she was told by the police that the hair on the back side of the head of the accused was similar to that of Khadeer. She was also told that the accused had covered his face with a handkerchief and hence the police did not get a clear image in the CCTV footage.
- The facial recognition app shows the similarity between two images. ŌĆ£Anything above 70% is considered as a good match. This isnŌĆÖt a fool-proof way to zero down on the accused, because two individuals may have several similar features. Several other factors are put together to decide if the person is the one behind the crime,ŌĆØ added the sub inspector.
- According to the police, KhadeerŌĆÖs build was also similar to that of the accused. If indeed the hi-tech apps were used, it raises questions about their reliability but also the competence of the investigators using this technology.
- While KhadeerŌĆÖs wife Farzana says she wasnŌĆÖt shown the CCTV footage despite several requests, IPS officers TNM spoke to said even if Khadeer was the one behind the crime, his illegal detention and assault was unjustified.
- TNM spoke to several senior police officers in the state to understand how FRT is used as a tool. ŌĆ£What is wrong in using Facial Recognition Technology? We have been provided the technology to make use of it. In several cases, it has helped find the culprit,ŌĆØ said a senior IPS officer, on the condition of anonymity.
- Meanwhile, the Internet Freedom Foundation, an organisation that defends online freedom in India, has put out a statement reiterating their stand that the use of technologies such as CCTV cameras and facial recognition is error prone. ŌĆ£The use of technologies such as CCTV cameras and facial recognition is error prone, as can be seen in the present case as well as similar cases around the world. However, the use of these technologies has expanded at a significant pace without transparency and accountability, across many cities in India,  and especially in Hyderabad. IFF is concerned that with the continued use of such technologies, similar cases of misidentification will continue to occur, the irreversible consequences of which will have to be borne by innocent citizens of India like Mr Khan and his family,ŌĆØ read the statement.
- Telangana Director General of Police, Anjani Kumar, on February 20, Monday, in the monthly crime review rapped the Rohini Priyadarshini, the Medak SP for the incident. For nearly 45 minutes the DGP spoke to the officers about the Medak SP. The DGP felt that it was a lack of communication between the SP and her subordinates that led to the incident. He asked the senior officers to take ownership of the incident at the leadership level and not to pass the buck.
- In the daily review too, on Tuesday, the Medak incident again found a mention. The DGP mentioned how the Telangana High Court has taken suo moto cognizance of the incident and asked for a report to be submitted. He was of the opinion that the incident has brought ill will to the department.READ: Wife of Telangana man who died after alleged police torture recounts horror to TNM

- "The CCTV footage was not very clear because it was evening and it was dark," said a police officer when asked what led to the detention of Mohammed Khadeer, a Telangana resident, who died recently of injuries he suffered in alleged custodial torture by the police.
- Police had picked up Khadeer, a daily wage worker in Medak, because he allegedly resembled a suspect in a chain snatching case caught on a CCTV camera. He was let off after the police ascertained he was not involved in the case, the police said.
- The police officer admitted to Moneycontrol that the unclear footage may have led to the misidentification of Khadeer as suspect.
- In a video message, Khadeer alleged that he had been subjected to custodial torture by the police when he was detained. He died last week of the purported injuries he suffered then.
- Hyderabad has, for years, been one of the cities with most CCTV cameras, including many equipped with a facial recognition feature. The state administration has been evangelising the use of CCTVs, claiming that the systems help in fighting crime.
- Not just Hyderabad, there has been a massive push towards the installation of surveillance technology in the entire country. If this recent incident is taken into consideration, it shows that technologies like CCTV can also harm citizens -- in this case, by playing a role in the misidentification of Khadeer as a suspect.
- "Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) is concerned that with the continued use of such technologies, similar cases of misidentification will continue to occur, the irreversible consequences of which will have to be borne by innocent citizens of India like Mr. Khadeer and his family," Anushka Jain, policy counsel at IFF, told Moneycontrol.
- The Telangana government has suspended the Medak Town police officers accused of torture and has ordered a high-level inquiry into the incident.
- Moneycontrol reached out to Telangana’s Director General of Police (DGP) Anjani Kumar, Medak Superintendent of Police (SP) Rohini Priyadarshini, and attempted to contact police officials accused of torture with queries on the matter, and this article will be updated when a response is received.
- The CCTV footage
- Khadeer wasn't in Medak town when the police started investigating the chain snatching that took place there.
- "The dress and personality of the person in the CCTV matched that of Khadeer. We verified the footage with locals --  they also said that he looked like Khadeer," the police official quoted in the first instance told Moneycontrol, explaining their reasons for zeroing in on Khadeer.
- The Times of India quoted Medak SP Priyadarshini as saying that Khadeer had been picked up because his "facial features" matched that of a suspect on CCTV. She clarified to The Print that facial recognition technology was not used in the identification process.
- This, coupled with the fact that the 35-year-old had a criminal record and the alleged similarity in facial features with the suspect, led the police to come to the conclusion that he had left town after committing the crime.
- "We thought he did the robbery and left town," said the official. However, Khadeer had come to Yakutupura, in the southern part of Hyderabad, to visit a relative, from where he was picked up by the police.
- "The police told us that the CCTV captured only the backside of the suspect in question. They told us that he had hair similar to Khadeer's. We asked for proof of the CCTV footage from the police, but we were not shown (the footage)," Mohammed Farooq, a relative of Khadeer, told Moneycontrol.
- From January 29, Khadeer alleged that he was subjected to third-degree torture by the police, before being released on February 2.  A few days later, he was admitted to a hospital in Medak.
- On February 12, with his condition worsening, he was shifted to the Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad. At the hospital, he issued a video statement alleging custodial torture. He passed away on February 16.
- 'Use of CCTV is error prone'
- "Reports suggest that Mr. Khan was identified by the Police through the help of CCTV footage wherein the suspect was not clearly visible and through statements made by locals. However, it has now become clear that he was not the suspect that the police were looking for," Jain of IFF said.
- "The use of technologies such as CCTV cameras and facial recognition is error-prone, as can be seen in the present case as well as similar cases around the world. However, the use of these technologies has expanded at a significant pace without transparency and accountability, across many cities in India,  and especially in Hyderabad," she said.

- Hyderabad: Controversy has broken out in Telangana over the death of a labourer, allegedly as a result of torture in police custody. Opposition politicians have demanded action and the state’s director general of police has ordered an investigation.
- Mohammed Khadeer, 35, was allegedly held for five days in connection with a chain-snatching case in Medak’s Arabgalli area and tortured. He died on 16 February after being shifted to multiple hospitals for treatment. His wife, Siddeshwari, filed a police complaint the next day, alleging that local officers had inflicted ‘third-degree’ torture on Khadeer.
- “He was seriously ill due to major injuries and was unconscious. All his body parts were damaged,” she said in the complaint, which ThePrint has seen.
- On Saturday, state police chief Anjani Kumar directed Inspector General of Police (IGP) Chandrasekhar Reddy to forward the investigation to a senior officer of Kamareddy district (closer to Medak). The IGP will supervise the investigation.
- “Disciplinary action was initiated against the inspector and sub-inspector,” read a statement from the DGP’s office.
- The police complaint was filed against sub-inspector Rajashekhar and constables Pavan Kumar and B. Prashanth. Medak Superintendent of Police (SP) Rohini Priyadarshini issued transfer orders to the policemen Friday.
- The incident sparked outrage among the opposition, with the Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) demanding a murder case against the police officers and Telangana Congress Chief Revanth Reddy seeking a probe by a special investigation team. Reddy had tweeted Sunday arguing that a video shot in hospital, in which Khadeer narrates the alleged torture, should be considered his dying declaration.

- Khadeer, a labourer from Telangana’s Medak district, was working in Hyderabad. In a video tweeted on 9 February by Amjed Ullah Khan — a spokesperson for a political party, the Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT), who has been fighting for the family —  he is heard narrating his ordeal from a Medak hospital.
- “I was picked up from (old) Hyderabad and was beaten up in the car and brought to Medak. They hung me upside down for two hours and beat me…my legs and hands were not moving… they later told me that they picked me up as a suspect as the thief resembled me, and later let me off with some doubt. I was brought in on 29 January and let off on 2 February,” Khadeer says in the video.
- “They (police) took me to the mandal office and asked me to declare that I was picked up just last evening and let off in the morning. They said it would create problems if I did not say that. I was asked to sign, but because I could not even do that (due to his condition), they signed for me,” he said, adding that two constables had hit him brutally.
- Khadeer’s family has said that he was first admitted to the government hospital in Medak and then shifted to a private one on Hyderabad’s outskirts by the police. Despite this, when his condition continued to deteriorate, he was finally moved to Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, where he eventually died of kidney failure.
- Khadeer’s post-mortem report is currently awaited.
- Also Read:  Two police encounters, two states, 28 years apart. And what the courts said
- Medak Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Saidulu has reportedly denied any kind of custodial torture, adding that Khadeer was merely questioned and let off on 3 February at the tehsildar’s office. The DSP added that there was a gap of five days between Khadeer being let off and being admitted to a hospital. “The police officers have no idea about what happened to him in those five days,” the officer claimed.
- SP Rohini Priyadarshini reportedly said that Khadeer was brought in as a suspect for chain snatching as his facial features looked similar to the suspect in the CCTV footage. He was brought in for questioning on 2 February and let off the next day, she added. The officer, to ThePrint in a text message, denied using any “facial recognition” software.
- Meanwhile, Amjed Ullah Khan has demanded a CBI probe or an inquiry by a sitting High Court judge on the issue, and an ex gratia payment to the family. Khadeer had contacted Khan for help when he was at the hospital. The latter had tweeted about the issue to IT minister K.T. Rama Rao and DGP Anjani Kumar at that time.

- Hyderabad: A daily wager who had accused police of brutally torturing him after falsely accusing him in a chain snatching case died at the Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad on Thursday, February 16.
- Today, February 18, police have promised an investigation and disciplinary action against some of the cops.
- Thirty-five-year-old Mohammed Khadeer was reportedly picked up by Medak Town police at Yakutpura in Hyderabad on January 29. Although Khadeer is a resident of Medak Town, he was in Yakutpura, visiting a relative, when he was held.
- Police suspected Khadeer of involvement in two theft cases registered in January. Examination of CCTV footage, cops claimed, led them to Khadeer.
- Khadeer has claimed he was released on February 2. On February 9, he was admitted to a hospital in Medak. On February 12, as his condition worsened, he was shifted to the state-run Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad. Doctors there told him that his kidneys were damaged.
- During his time at the Gandhi Hospital, Khadeer issued a video statement essaying what he allegedly went through while he was in police custody.

- Cops allegedly used rubber tyres belts to beat him brutally over the period of five days.
- “They hung me upside down for a couple of hours and thrashed me using rubber tyre belts. I kept telling them I am innocent but the torture did not stop,” he said in a video from the hospital.
- They also gave him electric shocks, Khadeer said. After his release, he was unable to either walk or move his hands.
- “The police attempted to force my husband to admit to a crime which he never did,” Siddeshwari, Khadiee’s wife, had earlier told reporters. The couple have three children.
- Siddeshwari, in a petition to the Medak collector, demanded action against sub-inspector Rajasekhar and two constables – Pavan and Prashanth.
- Medak DSP Saidulu meanwhile, refused to admit that police had tortured or confined Khadeer in illegal custody.
- “He was detained for questioning as the person involved in a property offence matched Khadeer,” he told media persons.
- By afternoon on February 18, the Director General of Police Anjani Kumar had directed Inspector General of Police Chandrasekher Reddy to hand over investigation on the matter to a senior officer of the Kamareddy district. The IGP is to supervise the investigation, the DGP said.
- Disciplinary action, too, has been initiated against the inspector and sub-inspector, the DGP’s public relations officer said.
- Khadeer’s death sparked a political outcry with the All India Majilis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) party demanding a case of murder be registered against the policemen involved in the case. AIMIM MLA Kausar Mohiuddin also visited Medak and attended Khadeer’s funeral prayers. He came down heavily on the police and demanded action.
- “Was he a Naxalite or terrorist?” asked the MLA.
- Srinivas Kodali, a researcher from Hyderabad, tweeted after the incident, “Custodial torture is a punishable offence and it is important we fight, but ask why was he picked up at all? If his facial features really matched with a criminal, then the Telangana police has to show us the proofs.”
- Former IPS officer and Bahujan Samaj Party leader from Telangana, Dr R.S. Praveen Kumar, also demanded the police register a case under Section 302 (murder) of IPC against the police personnel responsible for Khadeer’s death.
- “They are taking the lives of poor people like Mariaamma and Khadeer just on the suspicion of chain theft. And have you ever tried to at least touch people like Adani, Kavita or Vijay Mallya who are doing hundreds and thousands of crores of scams?” he asked.

- When it comes to rapid strides in the use of tech, Telangana Police has outdone others. The cost of this use of tech, without warrants and with great impunity, has been high.
- Telangana Police collect fingerprints. Photo: Srinivas Kodali.
- India is rapidly digitising. There are good things and bad, speed-bumps on the way and caveats to be mindful of. The weekly column Terminal focuses on all that is connected and is not – on digital issues, policy, ideas and themes dominating the conversation in India and the world.
- Custodial torture leading to the death of Mohammad Khadeer Khan in Telangana may make you wonder as to why an innocent man was targeted by the Telangana Police.
- The police justified their actions by arresting Khadeer for investigation into a gold snatching incident, where the thief was captured in CCTV cameras wearing a mask. Even though Khadeer was not the actual thief, he was arrested and tortured, leading to several questions on policing practices, the role of CCTV and facial recognition technology by Telangana Police, and why exactly he was targeted.
- A fact-finding committee in Telangana has concluded that there was no involvement of facial recognition in this, but merely some unrecognisable CCTV footage of a masked thief. Yet, the police tracked Khadeer and arrested him by tracing his location using cellular towers. Every cop in Telangana can find out where anyone is by just using a person’s phone number and the geolocation capabilities of cellular networks. All of this is without any warrants. In the case of Khadeer, extensive call data records were obtained to locate and target him.
- Since the formation of Telangana, digitisation and modernisation has made the Telangana Police a very futuristic force with a new arsenal of weapons of information. Along with improvement in physical infrastructure used by Telangana Police, you will find increased usage of technological tools that are just emerging.
- The police started maintaining 360 degree profiles of every citizen in the state, obtained from other government databases like welfare and revenue records. In case of criminals, the police carried out a large-scale surveys of where every ex-convict was in the state and geo-located their houses. This extensive datafication by police has resulted in various new policing practices.
- Every ex-convict is by default under extensive surveillance in the state and has been subjected to various forms of harassment by the police.
- Every day beat cops in Telangana randomly visit an ex-convict’s house based on a randomisation algorithm that directs them to the geotagged houses using the TS-COP app. The outcomes of this app were not necessarily good for ex-convicts, who were continuously harassed whenever there was a crime within their locality.
- So it was that if a crime happened, the cops went looking for the nearest criminal with a criminal history and tortured him to confess. I believe Khadeer was targeted for this reason, even though I am unable to establish any criminal history of him as the police are neither denying or accepting what they have done.
- Mohammed Khadeer Khan in a screengrab from the video in which he spoke of his alleged torture in the hands of police. Photo: Twitter video screengrab.
- TS-COP is the same application that also has facial recognition, which is used by cops randomly to stop people on the street in an attempt to identify if they have any criminal history. It is this application that also gives cops access to our call data records and geo-locations. Every aspect of policing including marking of attendance by cops, registration of FIRs, collection of evidence is done via this app.
- This ‘super app’ is a weapon in cops’ hands but it comes without a safety switch. Every beat cop has access to all sorts of information and there is no need for any warrant in what cops call “real-time policing”.
- Forget the right to privacy for a bit, the basic policing practice of securing warrants is dead in Telangana.
- This digitisation of all policing practices has created a circus of events in Telangana, where cops randomly stop you to photograph you, collect your fingerprints and visit your house in the middle of the night to check if you are home. These practices eventually got the backing of a law when the all new Criminal Procedure Identification Act of 2022 was enacted. But before that, the Telangana Police was evolving these practices as part of their modernisation drive (with a bit of digitisation) by experimenting on the masses in Hyderabad with complete impunity.
- The emergence of new extra-legal policing practices like Operation Chabutra, where teenagers were being detained post midnight, cordon searches in entire neighbourhoods, fingerprint searches, and facial recognition are all new policing tactics that have evolved with the aid of tech.
- How they are being used and on whom is evident, with most of these practices directed at the poor. The police has never told people under what authority they are being turned into guinea pigs for technology experimentation. Most people caught in such a position cannot afford to question police either.
- There was a minor win in terms of jurisprudence when the Telangana high court has agreed with a few ex-convicts on their harassment by the police. But there has been little change.
- To understand what happened to Khadeer Khan, one really needs to understand these various policing practices. In Telangana, these practices have evolved ahead of other states and they remain secretive. One should note there was no arrest warrant or an FIR in the case of Khadeer Khan for his illegal detention for five days.
- Policing practices have been traditionally authoritative. Police have always shown impunity and always assumed power.
- Technology is increasing this power inequality without any form of accountability in sight. The lack of a ‘Telangana Police Manual and Standing Orders’ in the public domain also makes it impossible to question the police on these practices.
- But the most important question that we need to ask is, do these new tech and practices that cops are developing actually work?  Khadeer’s death shows us they do not.

- By Srinivas Kodali
- Hyderabad: Thirty-five-year-old Mohammed Khadeer, a resident of Medak, died because of alleged custodial torture at the hands of the Telangana Police. He was picked up by the cops because his facial features matched a suspect in connection to a chain-snatching case from the town of Medak.
- He was let go by the Medak police after being allegedly subjected to severe custodial torture. It eventually led to his death while being treated in Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad on February 18. Khadir was an innocent man according to the Telangana Police, but why was he arrested at all?
- As part of any law and order investigation, the police have the powers to detain, arrest and question potential suspects. Any suspect who is being detained, arrested or being ordered to submit himself for questioning is required to be given notices or warrants under various sections of policing procedures and laws. In day to day policing these practices of issuing notices/warrants are not always followed by the police officials anymore
- In the case of Khadir, we do not yet know what kind of due process was followed while he was detained as a suspect.
- According to Rohini Priyadarshini – Superintendent of Police Medak District, “He was brought for questioning in connection with a chain snatching case as his facial features looked similar to the suspect in CCTV footage. He was brought to Medak town police station on February 2. His call data records were verified and he was let off on Feb 3 after confirmation about his non-involvement in case” as reported in the Times of India.
- .@KTRBRS, One Mohd Khadeer Khan-35 was picked up by Medak Police from Yakutpura,Hyd on 29th Jan as a suspect in a theft case & kept in illegal custody for 5 days tortured to third degree and later kept in house arrest denied medical help./1 @mahmoodalitrs @TelanganaDGP @spmedak pic.twitter.com/n7AgfAfVpU
- The Medak police personnel travelled all the way to Hyderabad and arrested Khair because somehow his facial features matched with the database in Medak (possibly because of the facial recognition system deployed across Telangana).
- It is clear there has been an error of a certain kind that has been made which wrongly led to the arrest Mohammed Khair. While the police declared him innocent and released him, he was still subjected to a gruesome form of torture because some systems has identified his facial features similar to a criminal recorded using CCTV cameras.
- In India, being subjected to a police investigation is a punishment in itself. When this happens to minorities, it is further extreme and unfortunately ignored most of the time. It is important that these lapses that took place in policing practices are rectified, so that they don’t happen to anyone ever.
- It is unclear at this stage how the Medak police have identified Mohammed Khadeer Khan as a potential suspect. While the statement of the Superintendent of Police gives us a hint of facial recognition being used, the system couldn’t have identified Khadeer unless he was an ex-convict.
- At present, according to the Telangana police, only the photos and biometrics of ex-criminals are stored by them in the Crime and Criminal Tracking Networks and Systems,(CCTNS) which is further used for facial recognition. The lack of transparency on how facial recognition and other policing practices are being deployed in Telangana makes it hard to conclude with any certainty.
- A lot of details of this particular case are unknown at present, it is likely to remain that way with officials tight-lipped on what has transpired. Since it was CCTV cameras that are partly responsible for what has transpired, maybe it will be CCTV cameras that will help us tell us what happened to Mohammad Khadir.
- Every police station is required to maintain CCTV recordings inside their police station for 30 days. The demand to make this CCTV footage public from January 27 (the day he was reportedly picked up), has to be made. Station officials responsible for his custodial torture, also need to be subjected to investigation.
- There are zero documents in the public on how the Telangana Police Facial Recognition System functions. If there is a potential match of facial features as was the case with Khadir, then the assumption is that the police will detain the person and produce them in front of a magistrate and follow up with investigation procedures.
- One of those practised procedures now is to determine the location of the suspect during the time of crime using Call Data Records of the suspect’s mobile cellular service. Obtaining anyone’s Call Data Records requires warrants that need to be submitted to the Telecom company in question to share the details. Again, there are zero documents available in public on how the police in Telangana is doing this.
- Ideally, all of these policing practices should be publically available as part of policing laws, rules, and policing manuals. The Telangana Police Manual and Standing Orders ideally should have the details on how the police are to conduct themselves during arrest, custody management, procedures on CCTV, surveillance like facial recognition, and evidence management.
- You will not find the Telangana Police Manual anywhere publicly. Since the formation of Telangana in 2014, there has been no new manual that was published. This is a problem as we as a society do not know what policing practices are being followed.
- What has happened to Mohammad Khadir is wrong. There has to be an investigation into this and corrections have to be made in Telangana with regard to policing practices. But we can’t make these corrections if we don’t yet know and understand policing practices.
- With respect to the new policing practices that have emerged like facial recognition, call data records, CCTVs, etc, it should be our duty to demand transparency and accountability as much as we demand accountability for custodial torture.

- Hyderabad: A fact-finding team of social activists visited the family, friends and neighbours of Mohammed Khadeer Khan, who died on February 21 following alleged police brutality. It concluded that the Medak police failed to follow the process of law and violated several provisions of CrPC, guidelines and judgments delivered by the Supreme Court and various High Courts in the cases of arrest and detention.
- The team came out with 13 pointers report that suggests that Khadeer was tortured and attempts were made to erase the evidence.
- Not just Khadeer, but his friend Rizwan and brother-in-law Moin were taken along with the victim and allegedly beaten for hours.
- No specific complaint or FIR was registered against Khadeer. “It is merely on the basis of misidentification that he was arrested and tortured,” said the report.
- Instead of producing before the regular judicial magistrate, Khadeer was produced before the executive magistrate, raising suspicions that he was arrested on mistaken identification due to footage from the CCTV camera.
- “The Medak police personnel came to Hyderabad in a private vehicle (Swift car) with plain clothes and without name tags to arrest Khadeer, thus violating guidelines of the apex court laid down in DK Basu case in arresting and keeping accused in police custody. Moreover, police collected Khadeer’s call data records without any warrants,” the report said.
- “It seems that police targeted Khadeer to hide their failure in arresting the real culprit involved in the theft case,” the report stated.
- The report alleged that police hesitancy to provide timely medical treatment to Khadeer was “to save their own skin”.
- Lastly, the fact-finding team has laid down recommendations to the Director General of Police (DGP). They are as follows:
- “Khadeer was a daily wage worker. His family consists of four persons who were completely dependent on him. Now this family is rendered orphans without male support,” the report concluded.
- The fact-finding team of social activists included Khalida Parveen, Murali Karnam, S.Q.Masood, Krishna Kumari, Manga, Deepthi, Kaneez Fathima, Kareema, Farisa Quadri, Naseem Sultana, Gayatri and Fariya.

- Mohammed Khadeer, a 35-year-old daily wage laborer, died in a hospital in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad on February 16, days after being arrested. During his hospital stay, he recorded a video in which he accused the police of extreme brutality. Khadeer had been arrested over an alleged chain-snatching case caught on a CCTV camera, and was released five days later. According to business portal Moneycontrol, the police admitted that unclear CCTV footage may have led to Khadeer being misidentified as a suspect.
- Facial recognition using CCTV footage is often touted as a solution to counter crime. According to a 2022 data report by U.K.-based technology research firm Comparitech, a handful of Indian cities are among the most surveilled cities globally. But these cities also have some of the highest crime rates. Hyderabad, for instance, is the third most-surveilled city in the world, according to Comparitech, with 41.8 cameras per 1,000 people. But its crime index — an estimation of the overall level of crime in a given city or country — stands at 42.9, according to Numbeo, an online database that specializes in cost of living. Internationally, cities like Zurich and Munich fare well on the scale, with their crime indices as low as 19.1 and 18.8, respectively.
- The lack of regulation around the use and the storage of data collected through CCTVs poses a serious threat to citizens’ privacy, according to experts, especially when facial recognition is used in conjunction with these systems. “This trend is something we witnessed across the board in our study, demonstrating that more CCTV cameras don’t necessarily mean lower crime rates,” Rebecca Moody, head of data research at Comparitech, told Rest of World.
- “Political messaging is such that people believe that CCTVs will lead to an increase in security.”
- Crime rates are increasing at an alarming rate in India. In 2021, according to the latest data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there was a 15.3% increase in crimes against women compared to the previous year. In India’s capital, New Delhi, crimes against women surged by more than 40% in the same period. All this while, the city had a network of 1,446.03 surveillance cameras per square mile — 26.7 cameras per 1,000 people.
- Data rights experts and activists have raised concerns over the alarming rise of video surveillance in India, but Delhi’s government has been celebrating it. “Feel proud to say that Delhi beats cities like Shanghai, NY n London with most CCTV cameras per sq mile,” Delhi’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, had tweeted in August 2021, sharing a related Forbes India article.
- “The Delhi government is trying to do a cosmetic fix where they think that crimes against women are only happening in public areas and it can be fixed through CCTV,” Anushka Jain, policy counsel at Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), a digital rights advocacy group, told Rest of World. “Political messaging is such that people believe that CCTVs will lead to an increase in security.” Rest of World reached out to the Delhi government but didn’t get a response.
- For every 1,000 people, Indore — the most surveilled city in India — has  62.52 cameras. Indore stands second to Chinese cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Chongqing, which have 372.8 cameras per 1,000 persons. Yet, during the first five months of 2022, crimes such as rape and house-breaking rose by 14% in Indore. The city’s crime index is at 48.37, just over Kozhikode’s 45.3, but the latter has only 0.05 CCTV cameras per 1,000 people.
- “The cameras are also watching, that gaze is also on us,” Delhi-based theater artist, Mallika Taneja, told Rest of World during a midnight walk in the city on January 22. As part of an initiative called “Women Walk at Midnight,” Taneja has been organizing all-women midnight strolls to reclaim the streets in different Indian cities for over five years.
- In 2012, there was widespread outrage in Delhi following the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman, known by the pseudonym Nirbhaya or “the fearless one.” The Indian government set up the Nirbhaya Fund to invest in measures to ensure the safety of women in the country. Many projects funded through this initiative involved installation of CCTV cameras, according to IndiaSpend.
- Swati Maliwal, the chair of the Delhi Commission for Women, told Rest of World that CCTV cameras help in investigating crime. “We handle more than 500 complaints in a day and we have to issue summons to the police for each case,” Maliwal said. “From our interactions with them, we have understood that CCTV cameras speed up the investigation. Once crime happens, CCTV footage helps in creating evidence and that creates a pressure.” The Delhi police has claimed they  solved more than 100 cases with the help of CCTV cameras in 2021.
- Yashovardhan Azad, a retired police officer who had served as special director of the intelligence bureau, told Rest of World that tracking numbers and using facial recognition are standard processes. “This is … for public order,” he said. “If there is a crime in any public area, then the police can ask for the CCTV footage and that satisfies the requirement.”
- "What we need basically is regulation regarding the deployment of CCTVs."
- In the absence of a data protection law in India, “there are no procedural safeguards” against the way CCTV data is stored, used or shared, Jain of IFF said. “We cannot check what is happening with the data,” she told Rest of World. “What we need basically is regulation regarding the deployment of CCTVs, standard operating procedures for the authority that is deploying it, and a data protection law to regulate how the personal data is collected.”
- Facial recognition can also be weaponized against vulnerable groups, including Muslims like Khadeer, research by independent think tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy shows. “The use of [facial recognition] by the police is likely to disproportionately affect Muslims because of the over-policing of some areas with significant Muslim populations, combined with police biases,” the report reads.
- In 2020, the Delhi police used facial recognition to investigate the North East Delhi riots, which had claimed the lives of 53 people — 40 of whom were Muslim. In its annual report that year, the police mentioned the use of “extensive technology” while making arrests after the riots. Of the nearly 1,750 people arrested, more than half were Muslim.

- Telangana DGP Anjani Kumar has ordered a probe into the custodial death of 35-year-old Mohammad Khadeer Khan, a labourer who was allegedly kept in illegal custody and tortured for five days by the Medak police following wide-spread outrage.
- The death following custodial torture has come as a major embarrassment for the BRS Government in the state. Use of facial recognition software by the Telangana Police has also come under criticism following the death.
- Khadeer Khan was picked up by police from Yakutpura in Hyderabad on 29 January in connection with a chain snatching case, apparently because his facial features matched with that of the culprit. He was thrashed so badly that his kidneys were severely damaged and also his spinal cord was dislocated. He was kept in custody for five days till 2 February but police asked him to sign a paper stating that he was in custody overnight.
- Badly hurt, he was unable to sign. So, somebody else signed for him. He was then kept under house arrest. Finally, he somehow got admitted to a Medak hospital and when local media raised a hue and cry, he was brought to Hyderabad for treatment.
- Khadeer Khan eventually succumbed to his injuries at Gandhi Hospital on 17 February. The video footage of his statement, while undergoing treatment in Medak, had gone viral where he named sub inspector Rajasekhar and constables Prashant and Pawan.
- There was widespread outrage and condemnation of the death due to custodial torture. While the SI was transferred to District Crime Records Bureau, the constables were transferred to Papannapet and Regode police stations respectively.
- Later, the DGP ordered an investigation by a senior officer of Kamareddy district. “The IGP will supervise the investigation. Disciplinary action initiated against the inspector and sub inspector,” read the statement from DGP’s office.
- Khadeer Khan’s wife lodged a complaint against the accused policemen demanding their removal from service and awarding a compensation amount of Rs 50,000.
- The AIMIM has also stepped in and an FIR was registered against the policemen. AIMIM MLA Kausar Mohiuddin met the SP of Medak for proper investigation. He also met the collector of Medak to ensure compensation of Rs 50 lakh and 2 bedroom house for the family.
