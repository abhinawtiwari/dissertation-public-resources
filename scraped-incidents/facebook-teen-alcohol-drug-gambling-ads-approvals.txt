- Research studies in the US and Australia show Facebook has been approving adverts targetting teen kids interested in smoking, alcohol, gambling, and extreme weight loss.
- Using a fake account, Reset Australia discovered advertisers could target teenagers on user interest areas such as gambling, smoking, alcohol and dating status.
- Using a similar process, the Tech Transparency Project found Facebook approved ads for pills, eating disorders, and dating services for kids as young as 13 years old.
- Facebook has since announced that it will no longer allow advertisers to target interest-based ads at teens.

- This report explores how social media platforms profile young people for advertising purposes, and highlights how out of step with community expectations this practice is.
- Previous research has shown that 65% of parents are uncomfortable with businesses targeting ads to children based on information they have obtained by tracking a child online1 (‘profiling for advertising purposes’). This research asked 400 young Facebook users what they thought of profiling for advertising, and found similar levels of discomfort. 65.2% of respondents expressed disapproval or concerns about being profiled.
- Using Facebook as a case study, this report outlines how Facebook develops and markets profiles about young people. It shows that while Facebook often uses very personal data to create profiles, they are not particularly careful about what they allow advertisers to promote to them.
- This practice is a misuse of young people’s data, and not what young people want to happen.
- Profiling for commercial advertising purposes should be curbed by stronger data protection regulations for under 18-year-olds. Reset Australia is calling for the introduction of a data code for children and young people under 18-years-old, so that their data is only captured and processed in ways that are in their best interests. This would restrict profiling for purely commercial advertising. A similar data code has already been passed in the UK, and is on its way in Ireland.
- We think young Australians deserve the same, if not better, protections.
- To be very clear, we did not run these ‘dubious ads’. We only sought approval from Facebook to run them, to clarify if Facebook might offer young people stronger protections. This report is not about these ads, nor advertising standards.

- Facebook allows advertisers to target ads for alcoholic drinks, pharmaceuticals, and extreme weight loss at children as young as 13 across the United States, according to new research by the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) that builds on a similar set of troubling findings in Australia.
- In an April 26 report, the watchdog group Reset Australia described how it was able to get approval for “dubious ads” for alcohol, gambling, and other harmful and risky behaviors targeted at thousands of Australian children between the ages of 13 and 17 on Facebook. (The ads never ran but made it through Facebook’s approval process and were scheduled for publication.)
- TTP used that report as a guide to conduct the same kind of experiment in the U.S. market—and found an equally alarming result: Facebook approved ads related to pills, eating disorders, and dating services for that same 13-17 age group.
- U.S. law includes online protections for children under 13. But the new research highlights how much personal data Facebook collects on teenagers above the age of 13, and how the platform allows advertisers to exploit that information in potentially damaging ways.
- In response to Reset Australia’s findings, a Facebook spokesperson said the company has “significant measures in place to review all ads before and after they run, including automated systems and human reviewers."
- But TTP found that all the test ads it submitted, which explicitly promoted harmful content to teens, were approved by Facebook in a matter of hours.
- TTP submitted six Facebook ads on harmful subjects including pill abuse, alcohol, anorexia, smoking, and gambling. All of the ads included broad demographics for users aged 13 to 17, of all genders, in the United States. Facebook quickly approved all of them.
- One of the most disturbing approved ads featured an image of colorful pills with the text “Throw a skittles party like no other.” “Skittles parties” (also referred to as “pharm parties”) are pill parties where teens raid their parents’ medicine cabinets for pharmaceuticals, mix them together in a bowl, and take them to get high. The pills often include opioid painkillers. The trend is dangerous, but it’s not new. The issue has been an area of concern for nearly a decade.
- TTP used the “interested in” tags for “pharmacy,” “pharmaceutical industry,” “drugs.com,” and “capsule (pharmacy).” Collectively, these categories yielded a potential audience of about 340,000 children age 13 to 17 on Facebook. While this ad was the last of the six TTP submitted to Facebook for approval, it was the second to be approved.
- Facebook’s policies explicitly state that ads “must not promote the sale or use of illegal, prescription, or recreational drugs.” Facebook’s approval of the pill party ad is especially troubling given the ongoing U.S. opioid epidemic, which the U.S. government declared a public health emergency in 2017.
- Facebook also approved a TTP test ad that promoted anorexia. The ad showed the waist of a skinny young woman and included text for an “ana tip,” the word “ana” being a well-documented shorthand for “anorexia.” The ad targeted interest categories for “diet food,” “extreme weight loss,” and “weight loss (fitness and wellness)” in the 13-17 age group.
- In 2019, Facebook and Instagram vowed to crack down on content that promotes eating disorders, and Facebook’s Community Standards ban such material. In a February 2021 blog post, Facebook touted its work with experts on negative body image issues and said it would share eating disorder hotlines with people searching for such terms.
- Facebook approved other TTP test ads that appear to violate its policies.
- One ad designed to mimic a dating service with a message reading “You look lonely” was approved within hours of TTP’s submission. Facebook’s policies state that “Ads for dating services are only allowed with prior written permission,” which TTP did not seek or receive in this case. Facebook also says advertisers can only target online dating ads to users 18 and older.
- Similarly, a test ad on gambling that read “Feeling Lucky? Win cash, prizes, and more!” got approved to target the 13- to 17-year-old age group within hours. This, despite Facebook’s requirement that online gambling ads must not target children under 18. (TTP did not allow any of the test ads to run.)
- The research shows Facebook is failing to effectively enforce its policies on ad targeting, particularly when it comes to children over the age of 13. The end result is that Facebook is positioned to profit from harmful messages—on everything from drug use to self-harm—aimed at a highly vulnerable age group.
- YouTube says it delivers ‘responsible’ video recommendations. But its algorithms steered accounts for young gamers toward content on guns, school shootings, and a serial killer.
- Vance has called for repeal of Section 230 legal protections, but only for big tech platforms. That would benefit his investment Rumble, a right-wing alternative to YouTube.
- Google says a ‘broad cross-section’ of experts, academics, and organizations support its legal position. The company is paying many of them.
- Facebook says it bans U.S.-designated terrorist groups. But the platform has generated more than 100 pages for groups like Islamic State and Al Qaeda.

- The social network fails to enforce its own rules on inappropriate advertising to teens, two new studies claim
- Update: On July 27, 2021, Facebook announced that it will no longer allow advertisers to target interest-based ads at teens.
- Advertisers can use Facebook and Instagram to target ads at teenagers who the social media giant thinks are interested in alcohol, tobacco, and extreme weight loss, two new studies have found.
- To test Facebook’s system for targeting consumers with online ads, the studies’ authors created Facebook ads featuring cocktail recipes, dating app offers, and weight-loss “tips” that promoted an eating disorder.
- The researchers used Facebook’s tools to target the ads at users between 13 and 17 years old who were categorized as being interested in those topics.
- Facebook gave the green light for all those ads, plus several more that promoted gambling and other adult activities, even though the company officially prohibits targeting teens with such ads.
- None of the ads were shown to the public. The two groups—an American nonprofit research organization called Tech Transparency Project and Reset Australia, a technology watchdog—canceled the advertisements after they were approved but before they appeared in Facebook users’ feeds.
- “Facebook—or any company—should not be allowing this sort of advertising to teenagers,” says Ariel Fox Johnson, senior counsel for global policy at Common Sense Media, a research and advocacy organization that studies how children use media and technology.
- “Teens are more susceptible to targeted ad techniques than adults,” Johnson says. “And all the problems with advertising to teens are exacerbated when you’re targeting teens based on their unique insecurities and problems.”

- These rule-breaking ads illustrate one of the enduring challenges of maintaining an enormous social media platform: Even if you write sensible-sounding policies—like Facebook’s bans on advertising alcohol or weight-loss products to teens—those rules are just words on a screen unless they’re strictly enforced. And researchers and journalists have repeatedly found that Facebook’s filters can allow harmful content to slip through onto its platforms.
- Keeping posts that break the rules off a platform like Facebook isn’t always easy. Hundreds of millions of Facebook users are constantly bombarding the site with text updates, photos, and videos. Facebook says that it takes down the lion’s share of harmful posts using artificial intelligence tools and a 35,000-person workforce that combs the site for violations—but that it can’t remove every policy-violating post.
- In this case, however, the ads weren’t full of slippery innuendo and cheeky code words. Facebook’s tools for targeting ads appear to allow advertisers to openly direct inappropriate ads at 13- to 17-year-olds who might be interested in dangerous topics. Facebook does not allow kids under 13 to use its products.
- The Tech Transparency Project designed an ad that offered teens “pro-ana” tips—that’s common slang for pro-anorexia—on a background image of a woman’s narrow waist. The ad was pitched at teens whom Facebook has identified as interested in weight loss.
- One of Reset’s ads encouraged users to “TRY YOUR LUCK” and “WIN PRIZES!” alongside icons of dice and a poker chip, and was targeted at teens who Facebook thinks might be interested in gambling. Both groups also created ads featuring cocktails and aimed them at teens Facebook had tagged as interested in alcohol.
- These “interests” are among the hundreds of categories that Facebook uses to sort its users into groups, based on their activity both on and off Facebook and Instagram, which the company has owned since 2012. Advertisers pay to access these categories of users to get their pitches in front of specific audiences.
- Tech Transparency Project (left), Reset Australia (right)

- The platform gives advertisers an estimate of how many people they can access in each group. The Tech Transparency Project found that Facebook shows a “potential reach” of 910,000 teens under 17 interested in “alcoholic beverages,” 300,000 teens under 17 interested in “gambling,” and 140,000 teens under 17 interested in “weight loss.”
- “That’s a flaw right off the bat,” says Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project. “Facebook shouldn’t even allow you to pick those interests when you’re targeting kids under 18.”
- A Facebook spokesperson tells Consumer Reports that the company is “investigating why some of these violating ads were not detected.”
- “We prohibit ads about alcohol, weight-loss products, and certain other topics from being shown to people under the age of 18, and we have age restriction tools so that businesses can better control who sees their content,” the spokesperson says. “We also may re-review ads after they are live.”
- All six of the ads that Paul scheduled were approved within half a day. Some of Reset’s ads, including two that showed young women exhaling smoke, were rejected, but Facebook accepted a version of the ad with a young woman holding an e-cigarette. A badge on the image said, “Cool girl.”
- Dylan Williams, who leads advocacy campaigns at Reset Australia, says he was taken aback that so many of the ads his group created got through the filter. “We were really trying our hardest to get the ads rejected,” he says.
- Both groups’ conclusions square with the results of an experiment that Consumer Reports performed last year. We set up seven paid ads with a range of COVID-related falsehoods, including one that encouraged users to drink bleach. The ads, which violated Facebook’s policies against coronavirus misinformation, sailed through the approval process. CR canceled the ads before they were shown to Facebook users.
- “I am appalled that Facebook still hasn’t fixed its ad-approval process, a year after your original experiment,” says Nathalie Maréchal, a researcher at Ranking Digital Rights, a nonprofit that grades tech companies on factors including their privacy and content moderation practices. “Enforcing its own rules for advertising is the bare minimum Facebook should be doing: They write those rules, the volume of ads is much smaller than user content, and they don’t have to weigh the same kinds of free-expression issues for ads as they do for user content.”
- Teens aren’t just the unwitting subjects of targeted advertising—many say they’re also creeped out by it. When Reset surveyed 400 16- and 17-year-olds about data collection and profiling last month, almost 79 percent of them said they were concerned about Facebook’s data gathering practices. They were particularly worried about being pegged for an interest in weight loss, gambling, or cigarettes.
- What can you do to keep unwanted ads out of your digital diet? It’s hard to avoid targeted advertising online—these ads are the financial engine of some of the biggest tech companies, including Facebook and Google. But there are a few ways to make it less personal and intrusive.
- Facebook’s ad preferences allow you to see what information about you is made available to advertisers, and the interest categories that Facebook has assigned to you. You can remove the categories individually if you don’t want advertisers to use them. You can also tell Facebook to stop using information about you that it gathered from other companies in order to target ads. However, you’ll have to follow separate instructions to tell Instagram to do the same thing.
- If you come across a Facebook ad that shouldn’t be there—if it appears to be targeting teens with alcohol ads, for example—you can report it to Facebook.
- You can also try to reduce the amount of targeted advertising you see elsewhere on the internet. Google allows you to turn off personalized ads, and a new feature on Apple devices like iPhones and iPads allows users to tell apps to stop tracking them.
- But Johnson at Common Sense says that teens shouldn’t have to jump through such hoops to avoid targeted advertising—they should be off-limits entirely.
- “We do not consider it in the best interest of children to show them ads based on profiling,” she says. Some countries, like the U.K. and Ireland, have recently proposed or published guidelines that discourage targeting advertising toward kids. “Hopefully, companies are going to start to listen.”

- Facebook approves alcohol, vaping, gambling and dating ads targeting teens, lobby group finds
- Facebook is accused of harvesting the data of teenagers and on-selling it to advertisers for targeted alcohol, gambling, vaping and dating ads.
- The findings were revealed in a report, released today, by lobby group Reset Australia — the local arm of a global initiative working to "counter digital threats to democracy".
- The group last year set up a fake account, Ozzie News Network, to test whether Facebook treated the data of teenagers differently to adults.
- As well as gleaning information about users from activity on Facebook, online trackers — known as “cookies” — can follow users as they browse elsewhere on the internet.
- The data sets are then used to create targeted ads by social media sites, such as Facebook.
- Investigations overseas have shown tracking and profiling occurs on other big tech platforms like Instagram — owned by Facebook — and YouTube.
- "What we found was there was no difference in the way they were treating teenager's data," Reset Australia executive director Chris Cooper said.
- "It enabled advertisers to buy access to those profiles and target teenagers around very questionable interest areas such as gambling, smoking, alcohol and even their dating status.
- "It's shocking and concerning."
- After discovering this, Reset Australia submitted its own advertisements in these interest areas.
- It says Facebook rejected two of its advertisements featuring regular cigarettes, but when it resubmitted the ads displaying electronic cigarettes, they were approved.
- Traditional advertising is tightly regulated but the law has not kept pace with the explosion in social media, creating what Chris Cooper calls a "loophole" in the system.
- "The [profiles] become easily accessible to advertisers on Facebook's ad platform and really any advertiser is anyone with a credit card," he said.
- "And what's worse is our experiment showed Facebook approved these ads."
- Citing ethical concerns, Reset Australia did not pay for the advertisements and they did not run on the Facebook platform, but the group believes they had passed the company's internal checks.
- In a statement, Facebook told the ABC "we have significant measures in place to review all ads before and after they run, including automated systems and human reviewers."
- "Anyone advertising on our platforms must comply with our policies along with all local laws and codes, such as those restricting the advertising of alcohol to minors in Australia," it said.
- "To support this, we also have age restriction tools that all businesses can implement on their accounts themselves to control who sees their content.
- Following the results of the experiment, Reset Australia wants the federal government to follow the lead of the UK and Ireland in moving to prevent the trade of teenager's data.
- The federal government is conducting a broad privacy review looking at traditional media as well as the way tech companies use data.
- Submissions have closed and Reset Australia hopes when the government responds it will consider laws like those introduced in the UK that put strict limits on profiles involving teenage social media users.
- "It essentially says that digital services and platforms cannot surveil, track and target children," Mr Cooper said.
- At Rosebank College in Sydney's west, the ABC visited five teenagers who were among the first in the country to see the report.
- Before reading it, year 12 school captain Isabella Callahan expected she would not be surprised by the report.
- But the results went far further than she imagined.
- "I was like, wow," she said.
- "I have had ads [on my feed] on how to make the perfect cocktail or how to get your summer body or your sports bet or your poker app," she said.
- "The shock value came after I saw those are the things that are advertised towards me that shouldn't be, because they should be over 18."
- Her friends were similarly surprised.
- "I think it's quite shocking that Facebook and other social media platforms are putting prices on our personal information, it's quite alarming," year 11 student Caitlin La said.
- "It just feels like you're being targeted and it's so specific and it does feel like you're being spied on."

- Teenagers on Facebook can be targeted by ads endorsing alcohol, drugs, gambling, smoking, and eating disorders, according to a report by a watchdog group. The Tech Transparency Project created six test ads and submitted them to Facebook, saying it wanted to reach users ages 13 to 17. Facebook approved all the ads within hours, including one promoting pill parties in 43 minutes.
- “This is an easy fix, and Facebook should have had the foresight to make it a long time ago,” said Tech Transparency Project director Katie Paul. “Whether this was an oversight or a money-grab is not important. It’s completely unacceptable.”
- As you scroll around Facebook and the wider web, its algorithms keep tabs on your behavior. Eventually, it places you into categories based on what it’s observed about you: your political leanings, your favorite music, your interests and hobbies, and so on. This is what draws advertisers, who want to show ads tailored to these groups.
- But many users are unaware that Facebook can infer everything from their race to their sexuality or relationship status just from their online activity. Moreover, several of these categories are inappropriate for minors. The report found that Facebook used teenagers’ behavior to place them in interest categories for “alcoholic beverages,” “extreme weight loss,” and “tobacco,” even noting if the teens were single so they could be targeted by dating site ads.
- All Facebook users are placed in interest categories. But minors under 18 aren’t supposed to be placed in certain adult categories. Facebook has gotten in hot water for showing inappropriate ads to children since at least 2014. As recently as 2019, an investigation by The Guardian found that children were still being labeled as interested in tobacco and alcohol.
- Reporters have uncovered other issues with the company’s algorithmically created categories. In 2017, a ProPublica report found that the company was permitting advertisers to target users who listed their own occupation as “jew hunters.” The next year Facebook apologized for indicating that thousands of users in Russia were “interested in treason.” Then, in 2019, Facebook settled with civil rights groups who alleged the company allowed advertisers to discriminate against certain groups when posting ads for jobs and housing.
- Facebook has guardrails in place to stop these from being shown to underage users, but TTP’s director says the test ads were approved “in a matter of hours.”
- “There’s absolutely no reason why Facebook should have tagged nearly a million teens as potentially interested in “alcoholic beverages” and other categories,” Paul said.
- Facebook did not comment before this article was initially published. After the article was published, a spokesperson said in a statement, "We're investigating why some of these violating ads were not detected. We prohibit ads about alcohol, weight loss products, and certain other topics from being shown to people under the age of 18 and we have age restriction tools so that business can better control who sees their content. We also may re-review ads after they are live.”

- TTP created six test ads, each designed around a topic users under 18 aren’t supposed to see. These include an ad for “ana tips” (“ana” is a well known abbreviation for anorexia), which TTP says it targeted at users that Facebook classifies as being interested in “extreme weight loss” and “diet food.” A fake vaping ad targeted underage users classified as interested in “electronic cigarettes” and “tobacco.” Advertisers aren’t permitted to target users under 18 with dating site ads, but TTP’s test ad was approved in only two hours.
- In addition to creating the categories, Facebook also shows advertisers its “estimated reach,” the number of users who may see any ad once it’s placed. Facebook estimated as many as 900,000 users would see the alcohol ad, while as many as 5 million would see the dating site ad. Without immediate correction to how the social network monitors its own rules around ad placement, the group warns, Facebook is “positioned to profit from harmful messages … aimed at a vulnerable age group.”

- An investigation has exposed an alarming loophole on Facebook that gives advertisers the opportunity to do something very disturbing.
- Advertisers looking to take advantage of young people on Facebook with harmful content such as extreme weight loss can reach 1000 teenagers for less than it costs to fill up a car.
- That is one of the alarming takeaways from a report that has laid bare how easy it is to target people aged between 13 and 17 with ads relating to extreme weight loss, gambling and dating wealthy men.
- Reset Australia – a lobby group monitoring digital threats to democracy – recently released a report titled Profiling Children for Advertising: Facebook’s Monetisation of Young People’s Personal Data.
- It has also released a 47-second video showing how easy it was to target the harmful ads toward young people.
- “This sort of profiling is part of Facebook’s day-to-day business model,” the report read.
- “Reaching a thousand young people profiled as interested in alcohol will cost advertisers around $3.03, $38.46 for those interested in extreme weight loss, or $127.88 to those profiled as interested in smoking.”
- The organisation developed a ‘dubious ads’ campaign and was able to get approval for ads that “reinforced body image ideals, set to be delivered to those profiled as 13-17 years old and interested in extreme weight loss”.
- The report said one ad encouraged young girls to connect and chat with wealthy men.
- It was set to be delivered to those profiled as female, 13-17 years old, single and interested in online dating services.
- Another ad which reached the approval stage encouraged people to “win prizes in mobile-game-style gambling,” which was set to be delivered to those profiled as 13-17 and interested in gambling.
- Reset Australia executive director Chris Cooper said it was wrong Facebook knew young people were interested in weight loss at all, let alone advertising for it.
- “Extreme weight loss was the most concerning (outcome of the report),” Mr Cooper told NCA NewsWire.
- “It is obviously inappropriate to advertise to young people about alcohol, tobacco and gambling but at least the ads are more controlled and restricted.
- “However, with weight loss there is very little control around it. The fact Facebook knows young people are interested in extreme weight loss is concerning, and then selling access to the relevant profiles. It floored us to be honest.”
- Reset Australia got the ads approved but did not run them.
- Mr Cooper also said the aim of the report was not the ads or advertising standards, rather the surveillance of young people.
- “The really important thing here is we should be concerned not just about content of these ads but more the surveillance and tracking of teens,” he said.
- In a statement provided to NCA NewsWire, a Facebook spokesman said ads were reviewed by software and staff.
- “Keeping young people safe across Facebook and Instagram is vital,” a spokesman said.
- “We have significant measures in place to review all ads before and after they run, including automated systems and human reviewers.
- “Anyone advertising on our platforms must comply with our policies along with all local laws and codes, such as those restricting the advertising of alcohol to minors in Australia.
- “Facebook does not sell your information. Instead, advertisers and other partners pay Facebook to show personalised advertisements to people on the Facebook company apps and technologies.”
- Reset Australia is urging the federal government to follow the UK and Ireland in moving to prevent the trade of teenager‘s data.
- “The UK has passed the Age Appropriate Design Code which gives young people the maximum level of privacy protections and Ireland has passed a very similar code,” Mr Cooper said.
- The Australian government is conducting a privacy review which is examining traditional media as well data use by tech companies.
- A colourful socialite has been cleared of importing large quantities of drugs into Australia after spending almost a year behind bars on remand.
- The Prime Minister has revealed how significant a toll constant online abuse has on him after one state’s leader unexpectedly stood down.
- Facebook users have been warned about a bank-emptying scam that cleverly targets your morbid curiosity.

- Facebook approved adverts targeting teenage children interested in gambling, smoking and extreme weight loss, a report says.
- Research by the lobby group Reset Australia created a Facebook page under the name Ozzie News Network to explore the advertising options.
- And it was able to create targeted ads, based on profiling by the technology giant, for as little as A$3 (£2.16).
- Facebook told BBC News it reviewed each ad before and after publication.
- “Keeping young people safe across Facebook and Instagram is vital,” a spokesman said.
- “We have significant measures in place... including automated systems and human reviewers.
- “Anyone advertising on our platforms must comply with our policies along with all local laws and codes, such as those restricting the advertising of alcohol to minors in Australia.
- “To support this, we also have age-restriction tools that all businesses can implement on their accounts themselves to control who sees their content.”
- Reset Australia - which describes itself as "working to counter digital threats to democracy across the world" - is campaigning to create a data code for children, which would stop profiling of under-18s and limit this use of data to commercial adult advertising.
- In the UK, the Age Appropriate Design Code was introduced last year to protect children’s privacy.

- Social media giant gave organisation behind a page for Australian 13- to 17-year-olds option to run alcohol, smoking and gambling ads for as little as $3
- Facebook is allowing businesses to advertise to children as young as 13 who express an interest in smoking, extreme weight loss and gambling for as little as $3, research by the lobby group Reset Australia has found.
- The organisation, which is critical of digital platforms, set up a Facebook page and advertising account under the name “Ozzie news network” to see what ad options Facebook would provide through its Ads Manager platform.
- While Facebook will not allow the advertising of alcohol and other age-inappropriate content to people under 18, it does not prevent advertisers from targeting children determined by Facebook’s profile to have an interest in alcohol, for advertising that might not appear explicitly to be about those topics.
- Facebook offered the page the ability to advertise to approximately 740,000 Australian children aged between 13 and 17, but then when the group refined the advertising by interest, found that, just as for those aged over 18, they were able to advertise to teens under 18 with interests in alcohol, smoking and vaping, gambling, extreme weight loss, fast foods and online dating services.
- To advertise to 52,000 teenagers interested in alcohol would cost $3.03, while getting to 14,000 teens interested in gambling would cost $11.24, or to fewer than 1,000 teens interested in cigarettes or electronic cigarettes would cost between $138.50 and $210.97.
- The organisation then tested it out by getting a number of ads mentioning winning prizes, or cocktails, or asking teens if they were “summer ready” approved for advertising to those targeted demographics. The ads were ultimately never sent out.
- Reset Australia has called on the federal government to develop a code regulating how data about young people can be collected and used, saying there should be express consent from children and parents, and full transparency over how the data is used, with only necessary data collected.“Facebook appears to use teenagers’ data in the same way as adults,” said Chris Cooper, executive director of Reset Australia. “This opens a can of worms about just how Facebook profits from underage data, and exactly what protection they have against inappropriate targeting.”
- “Should a 13-year-old who lists their single status be getting targeted ads for a sugar daddy dating service? Should a 15-year-old profiled as interested in alcohol see ads that suggest cocktail recipes based on their parent’s alcohol cabinet? Do we want 16-year-olds to have ads about gambling or political extremism targeted at them?”
- Facebook reviews every ad before it goes live but a spokesperson said in a statement ads could also be reviewed after they run, and would need to be compliant with local laws.
- “Keeping young people safe across Facebook and Instagram is vital,” the spokesperson said. “We have significant measures in place to review all ads before and after they run, including automated systems and human reviewers.
- “Anyone advertising on our platforms must comply with our policies along with all local laws and codes, such as those restricting the advertising of alcohol to minors in Australia. To support this, we also have age restriction tools that all businesses can implement on their accounts themselves to control who sees their content.”
- On Tuesday Apple rolled out the latest update to its iOS software for iPhones and iPads, which allows users to opt out of apps like Facebook tracking people across the internet, limiting the data the company can collect for the purpose of developing profiles for advertising.

- Reset Australia is demanding greater data protections for teenagers after it uncovered a Facebook loophole that allows teenagers to be profiled and targeted with advertising based on a range of age inappropriate interests, such as alcohol, smoking, gambling, and extreme weight loss.
- Facebook builds profiles based on interests, and then sells access to these profiles to advertisers for direct, targeted advertising. While underage Facebook users can not be served alcohol, cigarette or gambling ads specifically, in a new report Reset Australia finds a loophole which allows underage profiles to be targeted based on these illicit interests.
- Reset Australia found it costs advertisers $127 to target 1000 underage profiles with an interest in smoking, $38 to target 1000 underage profiles interested in extreme weight loss, and just $3 to target 1000 an underage profiles interested in alcohol.
- “Facebook appears to use teenagers’ data in the same way as adults,” said Chris Cooper, executive director Reset Australia, the local affiliate of a global initiative working to counter digital threats to democracy across the world."
- 
- Cooper added: “Reset Australia found Facebook allows advertisers to target teenage profiles based on a range of questionable interests - from smoking, gambling, and alcohol to dating status.
- “The highly targeted nature of this advertising is different to incidental viewing of advertising. A school bus with a beer ad on the side of it can’t pick a kid interested in underage drinking and then follow them throughout their day. But a targeted, granular ad will be in their phone, monitoring their activities and ready to target them every time they use social media.”
- Reset Australia says it ran a controlled experiment to see what oversight Facebook has over this underage profiling, and found “Facebook greenlit content targeted at teenagers which included vaping, cocktail recipes, political extremism and Q-Anon references, extreme weight loss, and adult dating. Reset Australia never published these ads.”
- Cooper continued: “We found Facebook approved a series of dubious ads, which included targeting teenagers with cocktail recipes, gambling games, vaping and extreme weight loss.
- “This opens a can of worms about just how Facebook profits from underage data, and exactly what protection they have against inappropriate targeting.
- “Should a 13-year-old who lists their single status be getting targeted ads for a sugar daddy dating service? Should a 15-year-old profiled as interested in alcohol see ads that suggest cocktail recipes based on their parent's alcohol cabinet? Do we want 16-year-olds to have ads about gambling or political extremism targeted at them?
- “Social media was never designed to factor in child protection. We need some ground rules to protect how young people's data is collected and used, especially given we don't know the long term ramifications of unchecked data harvesting.
- “Teenagers can't opt out of data gathering, but they also can’t meaningfully consent to it being used. Granular targeted advertising highlights just one way data is being used, but we have no idea how data collected from a teenager now will be used in the future.”
- Reset Australia says it is advocating for a data code for children as part of the federal government’s privacy review. If adopted, this would see social media giants and technology compelled to be designed with the interests of children in mind. It would include great data controls for young people and limit targeted commercial advertising.
- “Australia needs a regulatory code governing how children and young people’s data is collected and used. Other countries have already implemented or proposed similar codes, including the UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code, and Ireland’s Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data Processing,” Cooper concluded.

- Privacy-focused messaging app Signal has invoked the ire of Facebook after it created a series of advertisements designed to show Instagram users how their data is being used for micro-targeting.
- In a blog post this week, Signal’s head of growth Jun Harada said the app – owned by the non-profit Signal Foundation – found its ad-buying account banned by Facebook after trying to make a campaign of provocative advertisements on Instagram.
- “We created a multi-variant targeted ad designed to show you the personal data that Facebook collects about you and sells access to,” Harada said.
- “The ad would simply display some of the information collected about the viewer which the advertising platform uses.
- “Facebook was not into that idea.”
- Each of the ads would have been unique, designed to show users the type of granular data mined and stored by Facebook to run its lucrative targeted advertising business.
- “You got this ad because you’re a certified public accountant in an open relationship,” one of Signals ads read.
- “You’re into natural skin care and you’ve supported Cardi B since day one.”

- Even though the ad campaign didn’t get its full rollout, Signal was still able to get its message across about how you can use Facebook’s own services to see the inner workings of its surveillance operations.
- “This isn’t exactly a secret,” Harada said about how Facebook uses and sells data.
- “But the full picture is hazy to most – dimly concealed within complex, opaquely-rendered systems and fine print designed to be scrolled past.
- “The way most of the internet works today would be considered intolerable if translated into comprehensible real world analogs, but it endures because it is invisible.”
- Signal itself saw a sudden burst in users following a change in WhatsApp’s privacy policy that had people suddenly concerned about how their information was being used.
- Facebook spokesperson Joe Osbourne said Signal was being disingenuous and the campaign was purely a publicity stunt.
- "These screenshots are from early March, when the ad account was briefly disabled for a few days due to an unrelated payments issue," he said in response to images Signal shared to show it had been banned by Facebook
- "THe ads themselves were never rejected as they were never set by Signal to run.
- "The ad account has been available since early March, and the ads that don't violate our policies could have run since then."
- Facebook has been defending itself on multiple fronts as the company found pushback from Apple.
- Following a recent iOS update, Facebook pushed out splash screens to its Facebook and Instagram users encouraging them to let the company harvest their data and “help keep Facebook free of charge”.
- Selling cigarettes to children
- Closer to home, a recent report from digital rights group Reset Australia showed how it is possible to micro-target advertisements to people under the age of 18 on topics based on profiling that shows their interest in alcohol, gambling, cigarettes and vapes.
- Reset Australia ran an experiment using Facebook’s own tools to show the pervasiveness of how it profiles young Australians.
- The organisation first set up an account for commercial advertising – just like Signal did – and was then able to see the kinds of profiling Facebook offers on young people and how many people aged between 13 and 17 years would be captured by targeted ads.
- Reset Australia then successfully created what it called “age inappropriate ‘dubious’ ads” that it got Facebook to approve for Instagram – but Reset Australia did not run the ads.
- 
- Reset Australia was able to make ads targeting young people on age inappropriate topics. Image: supplied
- Josh Golin, Executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, said he wanted to see more targeting restrictions for teenagers.
- “When aimed at young people whose developing brains and desire for peer approval already makes them make more susceptible to advertising, [Facebook’s] business model is both immensely unfair and harmful,” he said.
- “It doesn’t have to be this way.”
