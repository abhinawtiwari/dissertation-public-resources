- 
- DETROIT — Two crashes involving Teslas apparently running on Autopilot are drawing scrutiny from federal regulators and point to a potential new hazard on U.S. freeways: The partially automated vehicles may not stop for motorcycles.
- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent investigation teams to two crashes last month in which Teslas collided with motorcycles on freeways in the darkness. Both were fatal.
- The agency suspects that Tesla's partially automated driver-assist system was in use in each. The agency says that once it gathers more information, it may include the crashes in a broader probe of Teslas striking emergency vehicles parked along freeways. NHTSA also is investigating over 750 complaints that Teslas can brake for no reason.
- The first crash involving a motorcyclist happened at 4:47 a.m. July 7 on State Route 91, a freeway in Riverside, California. A Tesla Model Y SUV was traveling east in the high occupancy vehicle lane. Ahead of it was a rider on a Yamaha V-Star motorcycle, the California Highway Patrol said in a statement.
- The vehicles collided, and the unidentified motorcyclist was ejected from the Yamaha. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
- Whether the Tesla was operating on Autopilot remains under investigation, a CHP spokesman said.
- The second crash happened about 1 a.m. July 24 on Interstate 15 near Draper, Utah. A Tesla Model 3 was behind a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, also in an HOV lane. “The driver of the Tesla did not see the motorcyclist and collided with the back of the motorcycle, which threw the rider from the bike,” the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.
- The rider, identified as Landon Embry, 34, of Orem, Utah, died at the scene. The Tesla driver told authorities that he had the vehicle's Autopilot setting on, the statement said.
- Michael Brooks, acting executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, called on NHTSA to recall Tesla's Autopilot because it is not recognizing motorcyclists, emergency vehicles or pedestrians.
- “It's pretty clear to me, and it should be to a lot of Tesla owners by now, this stuff isn't working properly and it's not going to live up to the expectations, and it is putting innocent people in danger on the roads," Brooks said.
- Since 2016, NHTSA has sent teams to 39 crashes in which automated driving systems are suspected of being in use, according to agency documents. Of those, 30 involved Teslas, including crashes that caused 19 deaths.
- Brooks criticized the agency for continuing to investigate but not taking action. “What the hell are they doing while these crashes continue to occur?" he asked. “Drivers are being lured into thinking this protects them and others on the roads, and it's just not working.”
- Musk has eliminated use of radar from his systems and relies solely on cameras and computer memory. Brooks and other safety advocates say the lack of radar hurts vision in the darkness.
- Messages were left seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.
- Tesla has said that Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” cannot drive themselves (despite what their names might imply), and that drivers should be ready to intervene at all times.
- In a June interview, new NHTSA Administrator Steven Cliff said the agency is intensifying efforts to understand risks posed by automated vehicles so it can decide what regulations may be necessary to protect drivers, passengers and pedestrians. There are no federal regulations that directly cover either self-driving vehicles or those with partially automated driver-assist systems such as Autopilot.
- The agency also says the technology holds great promise of reducing traffic crashes.
- NHTSA also has ordered all automakers and tech companies with automated driving systems to report all crashes. The agency released the first batch of data in June showing that nearly 400 crashes were reported over a 10-month period, including 273 with Teslas. But it cautioned against making comparisons, saying that Tesla's telematics allow it to gather data in real time, much faster than other companies.
- Tesla’s Autopilot keeps cars in their lane and a distance behind other vehicles. The company also is using selected owners to test “Full Self-Driving” software, which is designed to complete a route on its own with human supervision. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the cars will eventually drive themselves, enabling a fleet of autonomous robotaxis that will boost Tesla's earnings. In 2019, Musk had pledged to have the robo-taxis running in 2020.
- He said at the company's annual shareholders' meeting Thursday that “Full Self-Driving” is greatly improved, and he expects to make the software available by the end of the year to all owners who request it.

- A motorcyclist was killed by a Tesla driving on Autopilot on a Utah highway early Sunday morning, the latest in a string of recent fatal accidents involving self-driving technology.
- The biker, who has been identified as Landon Embry, 34, was killed when a 2020 Tesla Model 3 merged into his lane and struck the back of his motorcycle, sending him flying from the bike. He died at the scene.
- The Utah Department of Public safety said the unidentified Tesla driver 'advised he had the Autopilot setting on and did not see the motorcyclist.'
- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a special investigation into the crash, making it the 38th the NHTSA has investigated since 2016 where Tesla's advanced driver assistance systems such as Autopilot were suspected of being used.
- It is unclear if the Tesla driver has been arrested, or is facing charges.
- Samuel Case, a friend of the victim, was among those angered by the seemingly-avoidable loss of life.
- 'This was a buddy’s brother of mine, f**king ridiculous,' he wrote on Facebook. 'Riding in the HOV lane minding his own business going home and gets rear ended by a Tesla on Auto pilot.
- The unidentified father was killed along the I-70 near Draper in Utah (file photo)
- He was struck by a Tesla Model 3 whose Autopilot feature was engaged (file photo)
- 'He should be alive right now. He should be with his family, but No! Not only do we all have to worry about distracted driving but now it’s a thing to be run over by a car on auto pilot. #F**kTesla #F**kselfdrivingcars.'
- A total of 19 deaths have been reported in those Tesla-related investigations, including the most recent fatal Utah crash.
- The investigation marks the third this month alone involving Tesla's automated driving systems that the NHTSA has opened investigations into.
- Tesla has yet to comment on the death.
- The firm's cars issue a warning to drivers who use its Autopilot software reminding them that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and be ready to take control of the vehicle at all times.
- Some Autopilot crashes have been linked to parked emergency vehicles, whose lights and reflectors may confuse the sensors used by the Tesla to map out its self-driving route.
- The Utah wreck comes only a week after NHTSA said it opened a special investigation into the crash of a 2021 Tesla Model Y vehicle that killed a 48-year-old motorcyclist in California on July 7.
- Just two days after that accident, the NHSTA began investigating a wreck which happened at a Florida rest stop, where a couple's Tesla slammed into the back of a Walmart truck, shearing its roof off.
- The female driver, aged 66, and her 67 year-old male passenger were killed.
- That crash bore a striking similarity to a score of Tesla crashes that have occurred since 2015 in which drivers were killed when their cars merged into tractor trailers and wound up beneath them.
- The NHTSA typically opens more than 100 special crash investigations annually into emerging technologies and other potential auto safety issues that have, for instance, previously helped to develop safety rules on air bags.
- In June, the NHTSA upgraded its defect probe into 830,000 Tesla vehicles with Autopilot, a required step before it could seek a recall.
- The NHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation to assess the performance of the system in 765,000 vehicles after about a dozen crashes in which Tesla vehicles struck stopped emergency vehicles - and said last month it had identified six additional crashes.
- NHTSA administrator Steven Cliff told Reuters earlier this month that he wanted to complete the Tesla Autopilot investigation 'as quickly as we possibly can, but I also want to get it right. There's a lot of information that we need to comb through.'
- NHSTA began investigating a wreck (above) which happened at a Florida rest stop, where a couple's Tesla slammed into the back of a Walmart truck, shearing its roof off. The female driver, aged 66, and her 67 year-old male passenger were killed
- 
- Nearly 400 car crashes in the US within a ten-month period were caused by self-driving or driver assistance technology, NHTSA report found.
- Teslas were involved in the vast majority of those crashes, 273 out of 392, which occurred between July 1, 2021, and May 15 this year and resulted in six deaths and five serious injuries.
- Worldwide automobile companies made the disclosures to the NHTSA after the regulator issued an order in June 2021 requiring automakers and tech companies to immediately report all crashes involving advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and vehicles equipped with automated driving systems being tested on public roads.
- Of the remaining amount of crashes involving ADAS technology reported by a dozen automakers, 90 of them involved Hondas and 10 were Subrarus. Ford Motor, General Motors, BMW, Volkswagen, Toyota, Hyundai and Porsche reported fewer than five incidents each.
- Tesla, which has disbanded its press office, did not respond to a request for comment.
- Elon Musk's company has been in a series of probes from regulators due to its Autopilot feature
- January 20, 2016 in China: Gao Yaning, 23, died when the Tesla Model S he was driving slammed into a road sweeper on a highway near Handan, a city about 300 miles south of Beijing. Chinese media reported that Autopilot was engaged.
- Joshua D. Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio died in an Autopilot crash in May 2016
- May 7, 2016 in Williston, Florida: Joshua D. Brown, 40, of Canton, Ohio died when cameras in his Tesla Model S failed to distinguish the white side of a turning tractor-trailer from a brightly lit sky.
- The NTSB found that the truck driver’s failure to yield the right of way and a car driver’s inattention due to overreliance on vehicle automation were the probable cause of the crash.
- The NTSB also noted that Tesla Autopilot permitted the car driver to become dangerously disengaged with driving. A DVD player and Harry Potter movies were found in the car.
- March 23, 2018 in Mountain View, California: Apple software engineer Walter Huang, 38, died in a crash on U.S. Highway 101 with the Autopilot on his Tesla engaged.
- The vehicle accelerated to 71 mph seconds before crashing into a freeway barrier, federal investigators found.
- The NTSB, in a preliminary report on the crash, also said that data shows the Model X SUV did not brake or try to steer around the barrier in the three seconds before the crash in Silicon Valley.
- Crash scene photos show the wreck on March 23, 2018 in Mountain View, California
- March 1, 2019 in Delray, Florida: Jeremy Banner, 50, died when his 2018 Tesla Model 3 slammed into a semi-truck.
- NTSB investigators said Banner turned on the autopilot feature about 10 seconds before the crash, and the autopilot did not execute any evasive maneuvers to avoid the crash.
- April 17, 2021 in Houston, Texas
- A Tesla smashed into a tree and burst into flames in Texas, resulting in the deaths of two men - the car's owner Doctor William Varner, and his pal Everette Talbot.
