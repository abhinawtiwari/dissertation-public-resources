- The Wall Street Journal published a story today about internal research we’re doing to understand young people’s experiences on Instagram. While the story focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light, we stand by this research. It demonstrates our commitment to understanding complex and difficult issues young people may struggle with, and informs all the work we do to help those experiencing these issues.
- The question on many people’s minds is if social media is good or bad for people. The research on this is mixed; it can be both. At Instagram, we look at the benefits and the risks of what we do. We’re proud that our app can give voice to those who have been marginalized, that it can help friends and families stay connected from all corners of the world, that it can prompt societal change; but we also know it can be a place where people have negative experiences, as the Journal called out today. Our job is to make sure people feel good about the experience they have on Instagram, and achieving that is something we care a great deal about.
- The internet has drastically increased how many people we all connect to, and how much information we consume. As a society, we’re working out how to process these changes, and what’s right for each of us individually. At Instagram, we hire the best researchers and scientists we can to look at these changes, and to help us understand how they impact people. We also consult with leading experts and researchers around the world to help us see beyond our own work.
- External research into the impact social media has on people is still relatively nascent and evolving, and social media itself is changing rapidly. Some researchers argue that we need more evidence to understand social media's impact on people. Each study has limitations and caveats, so no single study is going to be conclusive. We need to rely on an ever-growing body of multi-method research and expert input.
- The research on the effects of social media on people’s well-being is mixed, and our own research mirrors external research. Social media isn’t inherently good or bad for people. Many find it helpful one day, and problematic the next. What seems to matter most is how people use social media, and their state of mind when they use it.
- A mixed methods study from Harvard described the “see-saw” of positive and negative experiences that US teens have on social media. The same person may have an important conversation with their friend on one day, and fall out with them the next day. According to research by Pew Internet on teens in the US, 81% of teens said that social media makes them feel more connected to their friends, while 26% reported social media makes them feel worse about their lives.
- Our findings were similar. Many said Instagram makes things better or has no effect, but some, particularly those who were already feeling down, said Instagram may make things worse. In the research world, this isn’t surprising or unexpected. Issues like negative social comparison and anxiety exist in the world, so they’re going to exist on social media too. That doesn’t change the fact that we take these findings seriously, and we set up a specific effort to respond to this research and change Instagram for the better.
- We’ve done extensive work around bullying, suicide and self-injury, and eating disorders, to help make Instagram a safe and supportive place for everyone. Based on our research and feedback from experts, we’ve developed features so people can protect themselves from bullying, we’ve given everyone the option to hide like counts, and we’ve continued to connect people who may be struggling with local support organisations.
- We’re increasingly focused on addressing negative social comparison and negative body image. One idea we think has promise is finding opportunities to jump in if we see people dwelling on certain types of content. From our research, we’re starting to understand the types of content some people feel may contribute to negative social comparison, and we’re exploring ways to prompt them to look at different topics if they’re repeatedly looking at this type of content. We’re cautiously optimistic that these nudges will help point people towards content that inspires and uplifts them, and to a larger extent, will shift the part of Instagram’s culture that focuses on how people look.
- We also want to be more transparent about the research we do, both internally and in collaboration with external researchers. We’ll continue to look for opportunities to work with more partners to publish independent studies in this area, and we’re working through how we can allow external researchers more access to our data in a way that respects people’s privacy. We’ll have more to share on our research, and new features we’re building, soon.

- Update on September 29, 2021 at 4:43PM PT: Earlier today, we provided Congress with the two full research decks that were the primary focus of the Wall Street Journal’s mischaracterization of internal Instagram research into teenagers and well-being. We added annotations to each slide that give more context because this type of research is designed to inform internal conversations and the documents were created for and used by people who understood the limitations of the research. Now, we’re publicly releasing these two research decks with annotations.
- Instagram Teen Annotated Research Deck 1
Instagram Teen Annotated Research Deck 2
- Originally published on September 26, 2021 at 4:00PM PT:
- In advance of Facebook’s Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis appearing before a Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Thursday, we want to be clear about what the research recently characterized by The Wall Street Journal shows, and what it does not show.
- It is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is “toxic” for teen girls. The research actually demonstrated that many teens we heard from feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced. In fact, in 11 of 12 areas on the slide referenced by the Journal — including serious areas like loneliness, anxiety, sadness and eating issues — more teenage girls who said they struggled with that issue also said that Instagram made those difficult times better rather than worse. Body image was the only area where teen girls who reported struggling with the issue said Instagram made it worse as compared to the other 11 areas. But here also, the majority of teenage girls who experienced body image issues still reported Instagram either made it better or had no impact. We go into more details below on how the research actually lines up with what The Wall Street Journal claimed.
- In addition to putting specific findings in context, it is also critical to make the nature of this research clear. This research, some of which relied on input from only 40 teens, was designed to inform internal conversations about teens’ most negative perceptions of Instagram. It did not measure causal relationships between Instagram and real-world issues. These documents were also created for and used by people who understood the limitations of the research, which is why they occasionally used shorthand language, particularly in the headlines, and do not explain the caveats on every slide.
- Studying these big societal issues and what impacts them is nuanced and complex. The Journal article implied that we were hiding this research and that the results are surprising, but that is simply not accurate. Not only have we talked about the strengths and weaknesses of social media and well-being publicly for more than a decade, external researchers have, too. For example, a survey and interviews from Harvard found that teens viewed social media “predominantly” positively, though they reported both positive and negative impacts on their relationships and self-expression. And a Pew Internet survey reported the majority of teens credit social media for positive outcomes, like 81% said it helps them connect, while some also pointed to its negative impacts, like 43% said they felt pressure to post things that make them “look good.”
- Our internal research is part of our effort to minimize the bad on our platforms and maximize the good. We invest in this research to proactively identify where we can improve — which is why the worst possible results are highlighted in the internal slides. That’s why the most important thing about this research is what we’ve done with it. We have a long track record of using our research — as well as external research and close collaboration with our Safety Advisory Board, Youth Advisors and additional experts and organizations — to inform changes to our apps and provide resources for the people who use them. For example on Instagram:
- Below, we contrast what The Wall Street Journal said versus what the research showed:
- WSJ said: “Repeatedly, the company’s researchers found that Instagram is harmful for a sizable percentage of them [young users], most notably teenage girls. ‘We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls,’ said one slide from 2019, summarizing research about teen girls who experience the issues.”
- What the data shows: The slide in question, which The Wall Street Journal did not publish as part of their report and we’re releasing below, shows that Instagram helps many teens who are struggling with some of the hardest issues they experience. On 11 of the 12 issues in the slide referenced by the Journal, such as eating issues, loneliness, anxiety and sadness, teenage girls who said they experienced these challenges were more likely to say that Instagram made these issues better  vs. worse.¹ The one exception was body image. While the headline in the internal slide does not explicitly state it, the research shows one in three of those teenage girls who told us they were experiencing body image issues reported that using Instagram made them feel worse — not one in three of all teenage girls. This is an important difference that is not explicit in the Journal’s reporting. And, among those same girls who said they were struggling with body image issues, 22% said that using Instagram made them feel better about their body image issues and 45.5% said that Instagram didn’t make it either better or worse (no impact).
- WSJ said: “Teen boys aren’t immune. In the deep dive Facebook’s researchers conducted into mental health in 2019, they found that 14% of boys in the US said Instagram made them feel worse about themselves. In their report on body image in 2020, Facebook’s researchers found that 40% of teen boys experience negative social comparison.”
- What the data shows: What the study also said was that 50% of US and 36% of UK teenage boys (who use Instagram and filled out a survey) say they feel better about themselves after using Instagram, including 18% of US teenage boys saying they felt “much better.” In fact, on 12 out of the 12 issues in the slide referenced above — such as eating issues, loneliness, anxiety and sadness — teenage boys who said they experienced some of these challenges were more likely to say that Instagram made these issues better vs. worse.
- WSJ said: “‘Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,’ said another slide. ‘This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.'”
- What the data shows: This finding comes from a set of focus groups of a small sample of 40 teenage Instagram users in the US and UK who struggle with body image, self-esteem, negative mood and/or other issues. What the Journal left out was another key finding from the same study: that the same teenage users say the overall effects of Instagram are positive for them. Additionally, based on the research the Journal left out, 8 out of 10 US teens who use Instagram and filled out a survey said Instagram either made them feel better about themselves or had no effect on how they feel about themselves. Here are some other important details from the slide above:
- WSJ said: “Among teens who reported suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users and 6% of American users traced the desire to kill themselves to Instagram, one presentation showed.”
- What the data shows: When we take a step back and look at the full data set, about 1% of the entire group of teens who took the survey said they had suicidal thoughts that they felt started on Instagram.² Of course, even one person who feels this started on Instagram is one too many. That is why we have invested so heavily in support, resources and interventions for people using our services. In addition, some of the same research cited by the Journal in the slide above shows that 38% of teenage girls who said they struggled with suicidal thoughts and self harm said Instagram made these issues better for them, and 49% said it has no impact.
- WSJ said: “But a mounting body of Facebook’s own evidence shows Instagram can be damaging for many. In one study of teens in the US and UK Facebook found that more than 40% of Instagram users who reported feeling ‘unattractive’ said the feeling began on the app. About a quarter of the teens who reported feeling ‘not good enough’ said the feeling started on Instagram. Many also said the app undermined their confidence in the strength of their friendships.”
- What the data shows: One of the studies cited by the Journal highlights that teens using Instagram in the US and UK are roughly 3 times more likely to say that Instagram makes them feel better about their life rather than worse about it.³ But that’s exactly why we’ve invested in this research — and because we’ve made these investments, we’ve been able to set up a specific effort to work on these issues to minimize the bad and maximize the good. Suggesting that Instagram is toxic for teens is simply not backed up by the facts.

- Read our research on: Asian Americans | Supreme Court| Economy
- Amid growing concern over social media’s impact and influence on today’s youth, a new Pew Research Center survey of U.S. teens finds that many young people acknowledge the unique challenges – and benefits – of growing up in the digital age.
- Today, social media use is nearly universal among teens.1 While notable shares say they at times feel overwhelmed by the drama on social media and pressure to construct only positive images of themselves, they simultaneously credit these online platforms with several positive outcomes – including strengthening friendships, exposing them to different viewpoints and helping people their age support causes they care about.
- Roughly eight-in-ten teens ages 13 to 17 (81%) say social media makes them feel more connected to what’s going on in their friends’ lives, while around two-thirds say these platforms make them feel as if they have people who will support them through tough times. And by relatively substantial margins, teens tend to associate their social media use with positive rather than negative emotions, such as feeling included rather than excluded (71% vs. 25%) or feeling confident rather than insecure (69% vs. 26%).
- Young people also believe social media helps teens become more civically minded and exposes them to greater diversity – either through the people they interact with or the viewpoints they come across. Roughly two-thirds of teens say these sites help people their age interact with individuals from diverse backgrounds, find different points of view or show their support for causes or issues. And they see digital environments as important spaces for youth to connect with their friends and interact with others who share similar interests. For example, 60% of teens say they spend time with their friends online on a daily or nearly daily basis, and 77% say they ever spend time in online groups and forums.
- The survey also illustrates the ways in which teens navigate social norms around what – and how often – they post to these sites. It is much more common for young people to post about their accomplishments or family life than to discuss their personal problems or political beliefs on social media. And while Millennials – some of whom are just older than teens – have been deemed the “selfie generation,” roughly half of today’s teens say they rarely (25%) or never (26%) post selfies on social media.
- For some teens, sharing their life online can come with added social burdens: Around four-in-ten say they feel pressure to only post content on social media that makes them look good to others (43%) or share things that will get a lot of likes or comments (37%).
- At the same time, the online environment for today’s teens can be hostile and drama-filled – even if these incidents may fall short of more severe forms of cyberbullying. Some 45% of teens say they feel overwhelmed by all the drama on social media, with 13% saying they feel this way “a lot.” And a similar share of teens (44%) say they often or sometimes unfriend or unfollow others on social media. When asked why they’ve digitally disconnected from others, 78% of this group report doing so because people created too much drama, while 52% cite the bullying of them or others.
- These are some of the key findings from the Center’s survey of 743 teens, ages 13 to 17, conducted March 7-April 10, 2018. Throughout the report, “teens” refers to those ages 13 to 17.

- Facebook-owned Instagram has been criticised for keeping secret its internal research into the effect social media had on teenager users.
- According to the Wall Street Journal, its studies showed teenagers blamed Instagram for increased levels of anxiety and depression.
- Campaign groups and MPs have said it is proof the company puts profit first.
- Instagram said the research showed its "commitment to understanding complex and difficult issues".
- The Wall Street Journal's report, not disputed by Facebook, finds:
- In response to the WSJ report, Instagram published a lengthy blog defending its research.
- The WSJ story focused "on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light", it said, but the issue was far more complex.
- "We've done extensive work around bullying, suicide and self-injury, and eating disorders, to help make Instagram a safe and supportive place for everyone," the company said in its post.
- "Based on our research and feedback from experts, we've developed features so people can protect themselves from bullying, we've given everyone the option to hide 'like' counts and we've continued to connect people who may be struggling with local support organisations."
- It was working on prompts to encourage people repeatedly dwelling on negative subjects to look at different topics, it said.
- And it promised to be more transparent about its research in future.
- But National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children head of child safety online Andy Burrows said it was "appalling they chose to sit on their hands rather than act on evidence".
- "Instead of working to make the site safe, they've obstructed researchers, regulators, and government and run a PR [public-relations] and lobbying campaign in an attempt to prove the opposite."
- MP Damian Collins, who is chairing the UK parliamentary committee looking at how big technology should be regulated to protect users' safety, said it was time to "hold them to account".
- "The Wall Street Journal Facebook files investigation has exposed how the company, time and again, puts profit before harm," he said.
- "Its own research is telling it that a large number of teen Instagram users say the service makes them feel worse about themselves - but the company just wants to make sure they keep coming back."
- The Online Safety Bill aims to give regulator Ofcom the power to fine companies that fail to act on content that could cause harm.
- US campaign group Fairplay (formerly the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood) said the news showed Instagram was no place for children.
- "In a move straight out of big tobacco's playbook, Facebook downplayed the negative effects of its product and hid this research from the public and even from members of Congress who specifically asked for it," it said.
- "And in the ultimate display of chutzpah and disregard for children, the company now wants to hook young kids on Instagram."
- Fairplay also called on the US government to demand Facebook released its research and blocked its plans to launch Instagram Youth.
- It was revealed earlier this year Facebook planned to create an advert-free Instagram for under-13s, designed to keep them safe.
- Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University's Stern School of Business, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had met Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg to discuss the social network's effect on mental health.
- "He was interested but he believes the research is ambiguous and does not point to harm," Mr Haidt said.
- "Of course, now we know they had their own research which did suggest harm."
- "They had focus groups, online surveys, diary studies - so this was not one chance finding.
- "I wouldn't expect them to come forward the first time they find evidence of harm and say, 'Oh my God our product is harmful,' but if they have multiple sources of evidence and there is evidence outside the company too, then I think the picture is pretty clear."
- But, he added, it would take root-and-branch changes at the company to make any difference.
- "The platform encourages children to post photos of themselves, to be raided by others including strangers around the world," he said.
- "If this is the business model, there is no way to fix it."

- Years of studies by Facebook found its photo-sharing app Instagram to have harmful effects among a significant portion of its millions of young users, particularly teenage girls, internal documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal show—though the company has publicly downplayed the negative mental health issues associated with its platform.
- An Instagram user looks through the app.
- Facebook has conducted in-depth studies on how Instagram impacts its millions of young users for at least three years but is yet to publicly share the findings, according to the Tuesday WSJ investigation.
- The newspaper obtained and published slides from presentations in which researchers summarized the findings of what they called a “teen mental health deep dive,” including a study which found Instagram makes “body image issues worse for one in three teenage girls.”
- The company’s internal research also found “teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,” a reaction researchers described as “unprompted and consistent across all groups.”
- Furthermore, among teenagers who reported suicidal thoughts, about 6% in the U.S. and 13% in the U.K. traced them back to Instagram.
- The researchers noted that many of these problems are unique to Instagram because it focuses heavily on body and lifestyle, meaning “social comparison is worse on Instagram.”
- Asked about the WSJ’s reporting, a Facebook spokesperson pointed Forbes to a blog post published in response which said the story “focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light,” but the company still stands by the research as it “demonstrates our commitment to understanding complex and difficult issues young people may struggle with.”
- “The research on the effects of social media on people’s well-being is mixed, and our own research mirrors external research,” the Instagram blog post treads. “Social media isn’t inherently good or bad for people. Many find it helpful one day, and problematic the next. What seems to matter most is how people use social media, and their state of mind when they use it.”
- Instagram head Adam Mosseri echoed these points in an interview with the WSJ, saying he is “proud” of the research. “I’ve been pushing very hard for us to embrace our responsibilities more broadly,” he said. Mosseri’s comments mark a pivot from earlier this year when he told reporters that research he had seen suggests Instagram’s impacts on the well-being of teen users is likely “quite small.” He is not the only executive to downplay the impacts of social media platforms on young people’s mental health: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a May congressional hearing said he didn’t think “the research is conclusive” on these platforms playing a role in children’s declining mental health. The company has refused multiple requests from members of Congress to share its research on children’s mental health, saying it is “kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.”
- While outlining the possible dangers of the app to young users, the research detailed by the Wall Street Journal also highlighted the importance of these users to its success. More than 40% of Instagram’s users are 22 years old and younger, and are vital to the company’s roughly $100 billion annual revenue, according to the Journal. “Instagram is well positioned to resonate and win with young people,” read one slide from the researchers. “There is a path to growth if Instagram can continue their trajectory.”

- In this article
- Facebook has repeatedly found that its Instagram app is harmful to a number of teenagers, according to a Wall Street Journal report published Tuesday.
- The Journal cited Facebook studies over the past three years that examined how Instagram affects its young user base, with teenage girls being most notably harmed. One internal Facebook presentation said that among teens who reported suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users and 6% of American users traced the issue to Instagram.
- "Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse," the researchers reportedly wrote. Facebook also reportedly found that 14% of boys in the U.S. said Instagram made them feel worse about themselves.
- While Facebook concluded that a large percentage of teenagers aren't negatively harmed by Instagram, according to the Journal, the features that the social media company identified as the most harmful are part of its key makeup.
- According to the report, researchers warned Instagram's Explore page, which serves users curated posts from a wide range of accounts, can push users into content that can be harmful. The app also has a culture of posting only the best pictures and moments, and it operates as an addictive product.
- "Aspects of Instagram exacerbate each other to create a perfect storm," the research said, according to the Journal.
- Top executives have reviewed the research, according to the Journal, and it was cited in a presentation given last year to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Still, Facebook has reportedly struggled to manage the problem while keeping users engaged and coming back. Facebook is also building a version of Instagram for kids under age 13.
- Young users are a key to Instagram's success. More than 40% of Instagram's users are 22 years old and younger, according to materials viewed by the Journal.
- In a blog post, Instagram's head of public policy, Karina Newton, responded to the reporting and said the company is researching ways to pull users away from dwelling on certain types of Instagram posts.
- "We're exploring ways to prompt them to look at different topics if they're repeatedly looking at this type of content," Newton said. "We're cautiously optimistic that these nudges will help point people towards content that inspires and uplifts them, and to a larger extent, will shift the part of Instagram's culture that focuses on how people look."
- The Journal report exacerbated at least one lawmaker's concerns over Facebook's exploration of a children's version of Instagram. Rep. Lori Trahan, D-Mass., has made children's mental health concerns in connection with social media use a key priority and previously rebuked Facebook for considering such a product.
- Following the Journal's report, Trahan called for Facebook to "immediately abandon plans for Instagram for Kids" and focus instead on protecting existing young users.
- "Facebook's internal documents show that the company's failure to protect children on Instagram – especially young girls – is outright neglect, and it's been going on for years," Trahan said in a statement.
- "Facebook has no business developing additional social media platforms explicitly designed for our children when they can't be trusted to keep their current house in order."
- Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has also made children's mental health online a cornerstone of her platform. In a statement Tuesday, she said Facebook "refused to comply" with a request from Republicans on the committee in March asking for its internal research on its products' impact on kids' mental health.
- A Facebook spokesperson said that due to the proprietary nature of the research and confidentiality concerns for participants in the studies, it can be difficult to share internal data outside of the company. Still, the spokesperson said, Facebook seeks to be more transparent about its internal studies.
- "This also leaves us wondering what else they are hiding," McMorris Rodgers said. "We will continue to demand transparency from Facebook and other Big Tech companies, especially as it relates to the harm their products have on our children."
- Republicans have circulated discussion drafts of bills including one that would require platforms like Facebook to submit regular reports to the Federal Trade Commission on their companies' impact on children's mental health.
- Facebook "knows Instagram is toxic for teens, but they don't care — they're too busy shutting out conservatives and stifling free speech," Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said on Twitter.
- Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., called the findings in the report "appalling" in a tweet and said he would be "demanding answers from Mark Zuckerberg."
- Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra later tweeted, "Given the financial incentives embedded in its surveillance-based business model, it is yet another sign that the company cannot be trusted with our data."

- Documents seen by The Wall Street Journal show that Facebook knows Instagram is toxic for young girls, which strays from the tech giant’s public position on the matter.
- For the last three years, Facebook has studied how its Instagram photo-sharing app affects the mental health of its millions of young users, and the firm’s researchers have repeatedly found that Instagram is toxic to a sizable percentage of them, particularly teenage girls, according to internal Facebook documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal.
- “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls,” said one slide from a 2019 presentation by researchers that was posted to Facebook’s internal message board and viewed by the WSJ.
- “Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,” said another slide seen by the WSJ. “This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.”
- The Instagram documents are part of a trove of internal Facebook communications reviewed by the WSJ, and show that Facebook has made minimal effort to address these issues and actually minimises them to the public.
- As part of a series entitled “The Facebook Files”, the WSJ on Monday reported (paywall) that internal Facebook documents revealed that the social media company has built a system that exempts high-profile users such as politicians, celebrities and journalists from some or all of its content rules while publicly claiming that its more than three billion users are given an equal platform.
- The programme, known as “cross check” or “XCheck”, shields millions of VIP users from the company’s guidelines and rules around what content may be removed, the WSJ reported.
- Revelations from internal documents describing Facebook’s research on the impact of Instagram, published on Tuesday by the WSJ, appear to be the deepest dive yet into what the tech giant knows about its impact on teens’ mental health and reveals a gap between Facebook’s understanding of itself and what it reveals to the public.
- Among teens who reported thinking about suicide, 13 percent of British users and 6 percent of American users traced the desire to take their own lives to Instagram, the WSJ reported after seeing one of the presentation slides.
- More than 40 percent of Instagram’s users are 22 years old and younger.
- Some 22 million teens log onto Instagram in the United States each day, which is a lot higher than the five million teens signing onto Facebook.
- For Facebook, which paid $1bn for Instagram in 2012, expanding its base of young users has been crucial in recent years as fewer and fewer young users turn to Facebook for their social media needs, show the materials seen by the WSJ.
- “The research that we’ve seen is that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental-health benefits,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told a congressional hearing back March, when lawmakers probed him about children and mental health.
- Then in May, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri said that research suggests the app’s effects on teen mental health are “quite small”.
- The dive into Instagram’s impact is made up of focus groups, diary studies and surveys of tens of thousands of people. In five presentations over 18 months, researchers found that some of the problems were specific to Instagram, and not social media in general, according to the WSJ.
- “Social comparison is worse on Instagram,” states Facebook’s research, referring to the tendency of users to compare themselves to others posting on the site.
- While other apps such as TikTok, a short-video app, are grounded in performance, Instagram focuses on the body and lifestyle. The pressure to look perfect and have an ideal way of life could send teens spiralling towards eating disorders and depression, internal research found.
- “Aspects of Instagram exacerbate each other to create a perfect storm,” the research said.
- Facebook’s findings were reviewed by the company’s executives and mentioned to Zuckerberg in 2020, according to the documents seen by the WSJ.
- But when asked last March by the lawmakers about the impact of Instagram on young people, Zuckerberg defended the company’s plan to launch an Instagram product for kids under 13.
- “I believe the answer is ‘yes’,” Zuckerberg said in front of the congressional committee when asked if the company had done research on Instagram’s effects on children.
- And when several senators in August asked Facebook to send them their internal findings on the impact of Instagram on youth mental health, Facebook sent a six-page letter but did not include the company’s research.

- Instagram makes teen girls feel worse about themselves, Facebook internal researchers reportedly found.
- Those findings were consistent across the past several years, the Wall Street Journal reported.
- Some teens using Instagram said using the service directly led to suicidal thoughts.
- Visit the Business section of Insider for more stories.
- Facebook's internal research shows that teen users' mental health is negatively impacted by using the company's photo- and video-sharing app, Instagram, according to a new report.
- "Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse," a Facebook internal document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal said. "Comparisons on Instagram can change how young women view and describe themselves."
- Those findings were consistent across the last several years of internal research, according to the report.
- In 2019, a Facebook internal presentation, viewed by the WSJ, said of Instagram, "We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls."
- Another presentation highlighted an even more troubling finding: a small percentage of British and American teen Instagram users said they started thinking suicidal thoughts due to the service.
- Instagram is far more popular with teens than Facebook's main social network, and the service's massive userbase skews young: Over 40% of Instagram users are under 22 years old, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
- Young users are so critical to Instagram's success that Facebook is currently working on a version of the service for children.
- "We have identified youth work as a priority for Instagram and have added it to our H1 priority list, Instagram vice president of product Vishal Shah said in an internal memo viewed by BuzzFeed News. "We will be building a new youth pillar within the Community Product Group to focus on two things: (a) accelerating our integrity and privacy work to ensure the safest possible experience for teens and (b) building a version of Instagram that allows people under the age of 13 to safely use Instagram for the first time," he said.
- When reached for comment, Facebook representatives pointed to a blog post that appeared to confirm the veracity of the Wall Street Journal's report.
- "While the story focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light, we stand by this research," the post said. "It demonstrates our commitment to understanding complex and difficult issues young people may struggle with, and informs all the work we do to help those experiencing these issues."
- Moreover, the blog post said its research found that social media services like Facebook and Instagram aren't, "inherently good or bad for people," and, "what seems to matter most is how people use social media, and their state of mind when they use it."

- Social media firm reportedly kept own research secret that suggests app worsens body image issues
- Facebook has kept internal research secret for two years that suggests its Instagram app makes body image issues worse for teenage girls, according to a leak from the tech firm.
- Since at least 2019, staff at the company have been studying the impact of their product on its younger users’ states of mind. Their research has repeatedly found it is harmful for a large proportion, and particularly teenage girls.
- “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls,” said a slide from one internal presentation in 2019, seen by the Wall Street Journal. “Thirty-two per cent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse,” a subsequent presentation reported in March 2020.
- Another slide said: “Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression. This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.”
- Comprised of findings from focus groups, online surveys and diary studies in 2019 and 2020, the Instagram research shows for the first time how aware the company is of its product’s impact on the mental health of teenagers. And yet, in public, executives at Facebook, which has owned Instagram since 2012, have consistently downplayed its negative impact on teenagers.
- As recently as March, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, claimed social media was more likely to have positive mental health effects. In May, Adam Mosseri, who is in charge at Instagram, said he had seen research suggesting its effects on teenagers’ mental health was probably “quite small”.
- In a “mental health deep dive”, marketing and product design executives and data scientists at Facebook concluded that some of the problems, such as “social comparison”, were specific to Instagram and not replicated by other platforms.
- “Aspects of Instagram exacerbate each other to create a perfect storm,” said one internal report, which said pressure to share only the best moments and to look perfect could pitch teenagers into depression, low self-esteem and eating disorders.
- Among the most concerning findings was that among users who reported suicidal thoughts, 13% in the UK and 6% in the US traced them back to Instagram. Another transatlantic study found more than 40% of Instagram users who reported feeling “unattractive” said the feeling began on the app; about a quarter of the teenagers who reported feeling “not good enough” said it started on Instagram.
- Facebook’s internal conclusions echo a number of studies that implicate social media in an epidemic of mental health problems among young people. In 2017, YoungMinds and the Royal Society for Public Health published research singling out Instagram as having the most negative impact on young people’s mental wellbeing of all social networks. Emma Thomas, the charity’s chief executive, said that while social media could be beneficial, it also came with increased pressures.
- “Being surrounded by constant images of the ‘perfect’ life and seemingly perfect bodies can also have a big impact on how you feel about your own life and appearance, and it can be really hard not to compare yourself to others,” Thomas said.
- A spokesperson for 5Rights Foundation, which campaigns for changes to digital services to make them more suitable for children and young people, said: “Facebook’s own research is a devastating indictment of the carelessness with which it, and the tech sector more broadly, treats children.
- “In pursuit of profit these companies are stealing children’s time, self-esteem and mental health, and sometimes tragically their lives … This is an entirely human-made world, largely privately owned, designed to optimise for commercial purposes – it does not have to be like this. It is time to optimise for the safety, rights and wellbeing of kids first – and then, only then – profit.”
- Facebook declined to comment, but sent the Guardian a link to a blog post by Instagram’s head of public policy, Karina Newton. She said the WSJ story had “focused on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light”.
- “Issues like negative social comparison and anxiety exist in the world, so they’re going to exist on social media too,” Newton said. “That doesn’t change the fact that we take these findings seriously, and we set up a specific effort to respond to this research and change Instagram for the better.”

- (Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc. is facing renewed fury from Washington after reports suggested the company knew, but didn’t disclose, that its Instagram platform could pose risks to teenagers.
- The report from the Wall Street Journal citing Facebook’s own internal research gives fuel to politicians who have pledged to hold social media companies accountable for their impact on mental health, civil discourse and democracy. While previous rounds of outrage over issues such as the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal haven’t dented Facebook’s business model or profitability, this backlash could bring Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and other company executives back to testify before Congress about the shortcomings.
- U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, the chair and ranking member of the Senate consumer protection subcommittee, said they have been in contact with a Facebook whistle-blower and “will use every resource at our disposal to investigate what Facebook knew and when they knew it.”
- The senators said Tuesday they planned to seek further documents and speak with witnesses as part of the investigation. The Senate Commerce Committee has the power to issue subpoenas for records and witness testimony.
- “It is clear that Facebook is incapable of holding itself accountable,” the senators said. “The Wall Street Journal’s reporting reveals Facebook’s leadership to be focused on a growth-at-all-costs mindset that valued profits over the health and lives of children and teens.”
- When asked about the Journal articles Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden thinks there are “serious issues around how much power internet platforms have amassed in our society and certainly some of that reporting is an example of that.”
- Tech giants, including Facebook, have been under increasing pressure from lawmakers questioning how companies handle user data, protect user safety and expand their market share and influence. While legislation aimed at regulating content moderation and privacy practices have stalled, there is momentum for antitrust measures that take aim at the companies’ size and dominance.
- A spokesperson for Colorado Representative Ken Buck, the ranking Republican on the House antitrust subcommittee, said the recent revelations about Facebook underscore why legislation is needed to curb the power of dominant tech firms.
- “Because Big Tech operates with almost unchecked power and answers only to themselves, it is not surprising they continue to peddle their products to children even though they are aware of the massive negative consequences children experience from engaging with their sites,” Buck spokesman Nick Givas told Bloomberg.
- A Facebook spokesperson referred to an earlier blog post from Karina Newton, Instagram’s head of public policy, about what internal and external research found regarding social media’s impact on young people.
- “The question on many people’s minds is if social media is good or bad for people,” Newton wrote. “The research on this is mixed; it can be both. At Instagram, we look at the benefits and the risks of what we do.”
- Lawmakers from both parties previously raised concerns about tech’s impact on young people. Washington Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the ranking Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, opened a March hearing with Zuckerberg and other tech executives by saying their platforms are her “biggest fear as a parent” -- a complaint she echoed Tuesday.
- McMorris Rodgers and other House Republicans wrote to Facebook after that March hearing to request the company’s internal research on the impact its platforms have on mental health. She said the company didn’t comply, “and we now know why.”
- “We will continue to demand transparency from Facebook and other Big Tech companies, especially as it relates to the harm their products have on our children,” McMorris Rodgers said Wednesday. “Parents deserve the truth.”
- Senator Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, on Wednesday sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking if he was personally aware of the internal research that showed mental health risks and requesting copies of those studies. The letter, also signed by Democratic Representatives Kathy Castor of Florida and Lori Trahan of Massachusetts, demands that Facebook abandon plans to create an Instagram for children and gives the company until Oct. 6 to respond.
- The Journal story focuses on the mental health risks such as anxiety and depression for young people, especially girls, who use Instagram, the photo-sharing app. The article references a letter that Blumenthal and Blackburn sent to Facebook last month seeking more information on how the company’s internal research informs products designed for children and teens.
- But Facebook’s reply to the senators didn’t include the company study detailed in the article.
- “When given the opportunity to come clean to us about their knowledge of Instagram’s impact on young users, Facebook provided evasive answers that were misleading and covered up clear evidence of significant harm,” the senators said.

- Your guide to a better future
- Senators say Facebook's platforms, particularly Instagram, are failing children and families.
- Facebook owns Instagram, a social media app popular with teens.
- US lawmakers pressed 
  Facebook
 on Thursday about the harmful effects its services could have on young people, especially teenagers, as concern mounts about what the social network knows regarding its impact on users.
- The Senate hearing, titled Protecting Kids Online: Facebook, 
  Instagram
, and Mental Health Harms, follows a series of stories in The Wall Street Journal about the social network's knowledge of the harm its platforms cause and its efforts to downplay those harms publicly. One of the stories reported that Facebook-owned Instagram's internal research shows the photo-sharing app specifically hurts the mental health of teen girls, particularly regarding body image.
- "Facebook has shown us once again that it is incapable of holding itself accountable," Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, said Thursday. "We know it chooses the growth of its products over the well being of our children."
- Facebook's global head of safety, Antigone Davis, represented the company at the hearing. She told senators she "strongly disagrees" with the Journal's characterization of the company's research, noting that its internal studies also showed the positive impact the app can have on teens. On Wednesday evening, Facebook released some of the research publicly and said it planned to look at ways to release more information.
- The hearing, which was heated at times, is another example of the intensifying scrutiny of the world's largest social network. US lawmakers of both political parties have demanded more answers from tech platforms, especially social networks like Facebook, about the impact they have on young users. Blumenthal said Thursday's hearing is intended to help lawmakers draft legislation that'll prompt social networks like Facebook to take action.
- Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, said Facebook has lost trust and that lawmakers will hold the social network accountable. At several points during the hearing, lawmakers compared Instagram to Big Tobacco, hooking teens early to social media by exploiting their desire to be popular online.
- "IG stands for Instagram but it also stands for Instagreed," said Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. He also compared Instagram to Big Tobacco, calling it the "first childhood cigarette" that gets kids hooked.
- At one point, Facebook's Davis disputed the importance of the company research at the center of the Journal's reports, which was also a frequent point of reference for the senators.
- "I want to be clear that this research is not a bombshell," Davis said. "It's not causal research."
- Blumenthal pushed back, calling the research "powerful, gripping, riveting evidence" that Facebook knew of the harms its platforms have on children. He said his office created an Instagram account that identified its owner as a 13-year-old girl, adding the account was recommended content about eating disorders and self-harm.
- The Connecticut senator inspired a brief flurry on Twitter when he asked Davis if Facebook would get rid of finstas, private Instagram accounts often maintained by teenagers in order to escape parental supervision.
- "Will you commit to ending finsta?" Blumenthal asked Davis, who replied that finstas aren't official Facebook products.
- The exchange prompted a flurry of jokes on Twitter, which the senator joined by tweeting out the "How Do You Do, Fellow Kids?" meme featuring actor Steve Buscemi.  The meme is often used as a response to people trying to enter a digital community they aren't part of.
- https://t.co/gBuZ8B2Oil pic.twitter.com/T6qscustPt
- Instagram on Monday said it would pause work on a children's version of its app. Davis said the company has been working on this project to give parents more control over their children's social media accounts.
- "We recognize how important it is to get this right and we've heard your concerns, which is why we announced that we are pausing the project to take more time," she said. Davis added that Facebook is exploring more tools that would "nudge" users to more "uplifting content" or to take a break if they're spending too much time on the platform.
- Thursday's hearing is one of several the subcommittee has planned. Lawmakers are also seeking answers from other social networks. On Oct. 5, a Facebook whistleblower is scheduled to testify before US lawmakers. The whistleblower, who hasn't been identified, will be interviewed on 60 Minutes on Oct. 3.
