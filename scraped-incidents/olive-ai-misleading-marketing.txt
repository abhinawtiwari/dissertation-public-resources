- US health care automation startup Olive AI is laying off 450 employees in a move said by CEO Sean Lane to have been caused by the company's 'fast-paced growth and lack of focus'.
- The company, which has gone through various incarnations since it was first founded in 2012 and been valued at USD 4 billion, has been dogged by questions about the efficacy of its software and the integrity of its marketing.
- One former employee told Axios 'There are hospitals that won’t touch [Olive] because they know people who’ve been burned … And I think people don’t want to admit it; there’s a big sense of shame about it.'
- Interviews with 16 former and current employees and health tech executives by Axios in April 2022 suggested Olive 'inflates its capabilities and has generated only a fraction of the savings it promises.'
- Alongside the July lay-offs, Olive said to would slim its product lines to the core billing automation software that represents 80% of its revenue.

- The Columbus-based health technology company Olive announced Tuesday that it is cutting 450 jobs, the latest of several Columbus companies to reduce staff.
- Olive, whose headquarters is at 99 E. Main St. Downtown, said the cuts are "based on the realities of today’s economy."
- Workers were told their work will stop immediately. They will be paid and will receive benefits for 60 days and will be eligible for two weeks severance pay for each year of service, according to a company notice shared with The Dispatch.
- "This is the most difficult decision I’ve had to make as CEO," sad Sean Lane, who founded Olive in 2012. "But I make it knowing this is the right strategy for us to deliver on Olive’s mission. I’m inspired by what we have done and will continue to do to ensure Olive’s transformative impact for many years to come."
- Olive employed about 1,300 workers before the layoffs. The company, whose technology links health care providers and insurance companies with customer information, expanded rapidly during the pandemic but allowed most of its staff to work from home.
- A year ago, the company received $400 million in funding and was valued at $4 billion.
- In a note to staff, Lane attributed the layoffs to the company's overly aggressive expansion.
- "We’ve grown rapidly over the last several years in service of creating a new healthcare experience for humankind," he wrote.
- "The realities of today’s economy are forcing us to rethink this approach. While we are experiencing many of the same headwinds as other organizations — including shifts in the industry landscape, evolving customer expectations, and challenging market conditions — we also must reconcile missteps we made.
- "Our fast-paced growth and lack of focus strained our product and engineering resources and prevented us from executing quickly on key initiatives. I take responsibility for this."
- He said the company will narrow its services in an effort to become more profitable.
- "We will focus on doing one thing, doing it incredibly well, and measuring what matters," Lane added.
- "Going forward, that one thing is the critical connection between providers and payers, starting with Autonomous Revenue Cycle for providers and Utilization Management Transformation for payers," which Lane said accounted for 80% of the company's revenue.
- An Olive spokesperson said the layoffs will not impact the long-term goals for a Worthington office but may impact the timetable.
- "We are moving forward with our commitment to our new HQ in Worthington," the spokesperson said. "This is a long-term investment that will support our vision and strategy. However, our planned investments for immediate improvements to this property will be scaled back."
- Olive joins several Columbus-area companies to announce layoffs this year, including Root Insurance, OhioHealth and Victoria's Secret.
