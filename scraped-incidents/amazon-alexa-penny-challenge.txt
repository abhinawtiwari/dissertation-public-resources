- Amazon has updated its Alexa voice assistant after it "challenged" a 10-year-old girl to touch a coin to the prongs of a half-inserted plug.
- The suggestion came after the girl asked Alexa for a "challenge to do".
- "Plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet, then touch a penny to the exposed prongs," the smart speaker said.
- Amazon said it fixed the error as soon as the company became aware of it.
- The girl's mother, Kristin Livdahl, described the incident on Twitter.
- She said: "We were doing some physical challenges, like laying down and rolling over holding a shoe on your foot, from a [physical education] teacher on YouTube earlier. Bad weather outside. She just wanted another one."
- That's when the Echo speaker suggested partaking in the challenge that it had "found on the web".
- The dangerous activity, known as "the penny challenge", began circulating on TikTok and other social media websites about a year ago.
- Metals conduct electricity and inserting them into live electrical sockets can cause electric shocks, fires and other damage.
- "I know you can lose fingers, hands, arms," Michael Clusker, station manager at Carlisle East fire station, told The Press newspaper in Yorkshire in 2020.
- "The outcome from this is that someone will get seriously hurt."
- Fire officials in the US have also spoken out against the so-called challenge.
- Ms Livdahl tweeted that she intervened, yelling: "No, Alexa, no!"
- However, she said her daughter was "too smart to do something like that".
- Amazon told the BBC in a statement that it had updated Alexa to prevent the assistant recommending such activity in the future.
- "Customer trust is at the centre of everything we do and Alexa is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to customers," said Amazon in a statement.
- "As soon as we became aware of this error, we took swift action to fix it."

- A 10-year-old girl and her mother got a lesson about the utility of voice assistants after Amazon's Alexa suggested the girl try the TikTok plug challenge. According to the girl's mother, Kristin Livdahl, the dangerous suggestion came after her daughter asked Alexa for a challenge to do.
- "We were doing some physical challenges, like laying down and rolling over holding a shot on your foot, from a Phy Ed teacher on YouTube earlier," Livdahl explained in her Twitter thread. "She just wanted another one."
- For the (blessedly) uninitiated, the plug challenge consists of partially plugging a phone charger into an electrical outlet and then dropping a penny onto the exposed prongs. Results can run the gamut from a small spark to a full-on electrical fire.
- "I was right there and yelled, 'No, Alexa, no!' like it was a dog," Livdahl tweeted. "My daughter says she is too smart to do something like that anyway."
- Amazon has since removed that particular challenge from Alexa's database, it confirmed in a statement to the BBC.
- "Customer trust is at the center of everything we do and Alexa is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to customers," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. "As soon as we became aware of this error, we took swift action to fix it."

- You might want to unplug your Amazon Alexa speaker before it has a dangerous influence on your children.
- Digital assistants are supposed to provide helpful answers and suggestions, but when asked by a 10-year-old girl for a challenge, Amazon’s Alexa gave her a potentially lethal response.
- Instead of suggesting a lighthearted game or physical activity, Alexa told the girl to play with a live wall outlet, as her mom, Kristin Livdahl, described in a Twitter thread.
- “The challenge is simple,” said Alexa. “Plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet, then touch a penny to the exposed prongs.”
- These instructions could have caused serious harm had the 10-year-old not known better or if her parent hadn’t been around. That’s because (as you might have learned as a child), inserting metals that are good conductors into a socket can cause electric shocks or start fires.
- Amazon responded to Luvdahl’s concerned tweet a day later, asking her to reach out directly so it could investigate. The retail giant eventually fixed the issue, telling Indy100:
- “Customer trust is at the center of everything we do and Alexa is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to customers,” said an Amazon spokesperson. “As soon as we became aware of this error, we took swift action to fix it.”
- Amazon didn’t specify why its digital assistant provided life-threatening instructions to a young girl, but it’s important to know that Alexa doesn’t pull answers out of thin air. The assistant is only as smart as the internet, and this time, its response was taken from an ourcommunitynews.com post describing a challenge that circulated around social media about a year ago.
- The so-called “Outlet Challenge” dared easily-influenced teens to insert a coin into a wall outlet. As is so often the case with these brain-dead internet challenges, at least a few people followed the dangerous instructions. It got to a point where the Massachusetts police sent out a warning after two teenagers, who faced arson charges, scorched outlets at their high school.
- Some folks may wonder why anyone would own Alexa products in the first place given their track record for invading your privacy. Livdahl says she received an Echo as a gift and asked the device for a suggestion after the weather got too cold to continue doing physical challenges from a PE teacher on YouTube.
- Taking the advice of a friendly Twitter user, Livdahl says she will enable the kids mode on her Echo so she has more control over the satanic speaker.
- It’s troubling that something so dangerous could come from the mouth of a product released by one of the biggest tech companies in the world. Clearly, Amazon’s algorithms aren’t doing a good enough job of vetting the information they grab from various online sources. And that isn’t the case with other personal assistants.
- When I asked the Google Assistant for a challenge, it presented fun thought exercises that seem to be custom responses rather than something pulled from a random website. Here are a few of Google’s challenges.
- “You’ve found a magic movie ticket that lets you become a character in any movie, but it’s a one-way ticket. Pick your movie and character.”
- “Your superpower wasn’t super enough to join any superhero squads, but you still love it. Describe your power, and come up with a story where it saves the day.”
- “You get to create a new national holiday! On what date does it falls, what is it called, and what does it celebrate?”
- If privacy concerns weren’t enough to persuade you against using Amazon’s voice assistant, perhaps its ability to disseminate harmful, even deadly, information will make you pull the plug on Alexa.

- In a viral post on Sunday, Twitter user Kristin Livdahl said the Alexa on her Echo device told her 10-year-old daughter to do a dangerous task when the girl asked the smart speaker for a challenge.
- Livdahl included a screenshot appearing to show Alexa's response when asked, "Tell me a challenge to do."
- "Here's something I found on the web," Alexa replied, according to the screenshot. "According to ourcommunitynow.com: The challenge is simple: plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet, then touch a penny to the exposed prongs."
- Amazon says it has since fixed the issue.
- "Customer trust is at the center of everything we do and Alexa is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to customers," a company spokesperson told Insider.

- Livdahl said her daughter didn't do the challenge, tweeting, "I was right there when it happened and we had another good conversation about not trusting anything from the internet or Alexa. No attempt was made to try this."
- In a separate comment on her original tweet, Livdahl explained that she and her daughter had been doing physical challenges from a P.E. teacher on YouTube, and the girl asked Alexa for a suggestion because "she just wanted another one."

- NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT
- A mother was shocked when her Amazon Echo Dot gave a potentially deadly suggestion when her 10-year-old daughter asked Alexa for 'a challenge' to do.
- On Sunday, Kristin Livdahl, shared a screenshot on Twitter of the message Alexa allegedly replied with.
- 'Here’s something I found on the web. According to ourcommunitynow.com: The challenge is simple: plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet, then touch a penny to the exposed prongs,' said Alexa.
- Ironically, the article that Alexa pulled this response from warns parents against their children doing the 'outlet challenge' that went viral on TikTok in January.
- The 'outlet challenge' went viral when teenagers started taking part in the dangerous trend and TikTok has since banned searches for it. The challenge essentially tells people to poke a penny into a power outlet with a phone charger. The penny creates sparks and a potential fire hazard.
- Alexa uses the Bing search engine for all of her search queries by default. So, the message is likely an automated one, rather than a conscious decision by anyone working at Amazon.
- 'Our customers want Alexa to get smarter and more helpful to them every day. To do that, we use your requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems using machine learning,' Amazon states on its website.
- OMFG My 10 year old just asked Alexa on our Echo for a challenge and this is what she said. pic.twitter.com/HgGgrLbdS8
- According to the tech giant, Alexa 'relies in part on supervised machine learning, an industry-standard practice where humans review an extremely small sample of requests to help Alexa understand the correct interpretation of a request and provide the appropriate response in the future'.

- While one Twitter user asked why the child was asking Alexa for challenges in the first place, Livdahl responded saying, 'We have been doing some physical challenges from a Phy Ed teacher on YouTube as the weather gets colder and she just wanted another one. I was right there. The Echo was a gift and is mostly used as a timer and to play songs and podcasts.'
- Some people pointed out that allowing unfiltered results to be pulled by Alexa was potentially problematic.
- 'Companies should really know better than to put unfiltered question answering systems live on the internet. Google does this in their summaries too, and they similarly have shocking/dangerous results like this periodically,' said one Twitter user.
- On Monday, Amazon spotted Livdahl’s Twitter post and took to the comments to apologise and asked her to reach out directly using a link so 'they could look into this further'.
- 'Customer trust is at the centre of everything we do and Alexa is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to customers. As soon as we became aware of this error, we took swift action to fix it,' an Amazon spokesperson told Metro.co.uk.
