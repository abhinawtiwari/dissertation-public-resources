- Japan’s Henn-na Hotel decommissioned half of its 243 robot employees after they malfunctioned, failed to do their jobs, and proved irritating, drawing complaints from customers.
- The Wall Street Journal reported that the velociraptor check-in robots were unable to handle foreign guests or photocopy passports, the concierge robot was unable to answer questions about flight schedules and tourist attractions, robot luggage carriers could only reach about a quarter of the rooms, failed in rain or snow, and would get stuck trying to pass each other in corridors.
- Henn-na ('weird') Hotel had heavily hyped the robots upon their introduction in 2015. But they appear quickly to have outlived their usefulness and value, and have in many instances been replaced with humans.

- It turns out that even robots are having a tough time holding down a job. Japan’s Henn-na  “Strange” Hotel has laid off half its 243 robots after they created more problems than they could solve, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
- One of the layoffs included a doll-shaped assistant in each hotel room called Churi. Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa can answer questions about local businesses’ opening and closing times, but Churi couldn’t. When hotel guests asked Churi “What time does the theme park open?” it didn’t have a good answer. That was a problem because Churi was supposed to help ameliorate the Strange Hotel’s staff shortage by substituting in for human workers.
- Others on the chopping block:
- Many of the robots that have been retired were in service for years, making them outdated. The hotel decided it was easier to fire them than to replace them, citing high costs. And in the end, a lot of the work had to be left to humans anyway, especially when it came to asking more complex questions. It seems we’re still a little ways off from a completely automated hotel.

- Japan's iconic Henn-na — literally "Strange" ­— hotel has decommissioned half of the 243 robots it once used to handle everyday operations.
- Since opening in 2015, the hotel has raised publicity by "employing" hundreds of bizarre robots that ranged from bizarre-but-helpful-I-guess to downright annoying, according to The Wall Street Journal. The robot helpers made for a fun gimmick, but weren't quite ready for the big leagues — a blow not just to dreams of an automated world, but to Japan's pop-culture image as a leader in the space.
- Some of the problems stem from creative ideas that didn't pan out, like a robot velociraptor that staffed the check-in desk. Others came from an inability to keep up with the breakneck pace of assistive technology, like how Churi, the personal assistant robot found in each room, could handle basic tasks but pales in comparison to the personal assistant that comes standard with any new smartphone.
- In case after case, these robots proved too annoying or broke down too often to be worth the trouble, according to the WSJ. The velociraptor couldn't handle foreign guests, for instance; human employees had to come over to photocopy their passports.
- Churi could change a room's temperature and respond to basic small talk, but couldn't answer any questions about the area or other attractions. Meawhile, Henn-na Hotel's management was so confident in the robots' abilities that they didn't equip rooms with phones. Later on, management made up for Churi's limitations with the cutting-edge solution of placing a human employee at the front desk to answer questions.
- Meanwhile, Churi would reportedly wake up guests again and again after mistaking their snoring for a question that the robot couldn't quite understand.
- So what if Henn-na Hotel's robotic luggage shuttles get in each other's way and can only access about a quarter of the hotel's rooms without breaking down? The ubiquitous presence of these robots, even the immobilized bot who forever sits at the piano without ever playing a note, gives the hotel a retro-futuristic vibe, sort of like how the Jetsons had an autonomous robot maid but still gathered around a tiny television set.
- In the future, Henn-na Hotel plans to adopt robotic technology that's more similar to the advances we see elsewhere, like facial recognition door locks, the WSJ reports. It won't be as charming, but it should work a little bit better.

- Chinese netizens have reacted with amusement after the world’s “first robot-staffed hotel,” Japan’s Henn na in Nagasaki, announced that it was decommissioning close to half of its 240 non-human staff due to their inefficiency.
- Within 24 hours, a satirical Weibo video on the “layoffs” had gained 6.6 million views and close to 2,000 comments.
- Some were creeped out or confused by the hotel’s quirky staff as depicted in the video. “Although their faces are smiling, I feel cold,” one netizen wrote on Weibo.
- “What the hell are those dinosaurs,” another commenter posted, referring to two small velociraptors manning the front desk. The robots were programmed to check guests in or out using one of four languages–Japanese, English, Chinese, or Korean.
- Unfortunately, they were unable to scan guests’ passports, necessitating human intervention. Humanoid bots used to carry luggage and act as front-desk concierges were also decommissioned due to their inefficiency, as were unhelpful robot “assistants” installed in each room.
- Henn na Hotel decided to get rid of half of 243 machine employees rather than replace them, in part because they sometimes made more work for the human staff.
- The reversal of the typical AI-replaces-humans narrative tickled some netizens. “Robots can also lose their jobs,” one commenter wrote, followed by a crying laughing emoji.
- Another took a more serious tack: “If you want to invest in robots, technical updates are a very important safeguard.”
- The Nagasaki hotel made waves when it opened in 2015, and entered the Guinness Book of World records the next year for being the first robot-staffed hotel. In addition to robot staff, as of 2016 it also supported facial recognition for unlocking rooms.
- The recent news of “layoffs” may have struck a chord with Chinese viewers as domestic companies charge forward into the field of AI. Advances in a variety of applications, from autonomous driving to logistics, have spurred worries that robots will take over increasing numbers of human jobs.
- However, experts say that for some fields, including translation and food delivery, those concerns are premature. It appears that human-level hotel service can be added to the list.

- The Henn na Hotel in Japan, which from 2015 has employed almost 250 robots to meet guests’ needs, is cutting back on automation after its experiment failed to reduce costs or workload for employees, reports The Wall Street Journal.
- 
- The hotel will reduce its robotic workforce by more than half and return to more traditional human-provided services for guests, though it will maintain a number of robots in areas where it found them to be effective and efficient. Its change of direction can offer lessons for companies that are pursuing robotic solutions for customer service roles.
- The hotel utilized a host of robots including in-room voice assistants and a robotic concierge. It also put robots to work behind the scenes to complete tasks such as sorting and transporting luggage. While robots moving luggage into and out of storage containers or around the hotel has proven to be useful, most of the other deployments have not, for a variety of reasons.
- Foremost among these is the growing obsolescence of some of these robots, with units like the in-room assistants lagging behind consumer AI-powered voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant and leaving customers frustrated with their experience. In other instances, robots didn’t actually eliminate the need for workers, such as at the concierge desk, where robots designed to look like velociraptors greeted guests but still needed humans to make copies of passports, for example.
- As companies like LG and Ubtech develop robotic solutions for customer service positions and the likes of Google and Amazon look to consumer robotics, they’d do well to consider the Henn ha Hotel’s experience. The hotel sought to use robots whenever and wherever it could without necessarily looking first at how they’d impact customers and employees.
- Most consumers, 61% in all, are still uncomfortable with robots, according to survey data from the Brookings Institution. Though this will change as they are introduced into consumer-facing roles, companies might still be best served by developing technology that consumers don’t necessarily need to work with directly.
- Instead, robots should be developed for tasks where they work alongside trained employees and are likely to have the most meaningful impact — companies such as Radial are using robots at fulfillment centers to reduce training time and increase worker efficiency, for instance.

- Management of the Henn na Hotel in Japan pulls the plug on virtual assistants along with concierge and bellhop robots.
- The robot revolution is already underway, from automation to mechanical pets to machines that do just about anything a human can do. And while robotics may be the way of the future, it has more than a few of us worried that humans might eventually become obsolete, another victim of modernization. But we got some good news this week, in the form of pink slips for artificial intelligence. So if you're concerned about the robot revolution taking jobs away from us hard working humans, you can breathe a sigh of relief.
- The Henn-Na Hotel in Urayasu, Japan once boasted about its all-robot staff, saying it would allow them to become the most efficient hotel in the world, and also lay the groundwork for a new standard in the hotel industry - all while entertaining their guests along the way. But it turned out that most of the customers thought the robots were a joke, and nobody was laughing. One of the biggest issues was the virtual assistant in every room, called Churi, which reportedly kept acting up multiple times a day, causing confusion and lack of sleep for some customers. One guest even said it kept waking him up, thinking his snoring was a request for help. Other guests said Churi would frequently interrupt their conversations, and some reported receiving room service orders they never ordered.
- But Churi wasn't the only robot to be given the virtual pink slip. Humanoid concierge robots and dinosaur robotic check-in-bot couldn't answer basic questions, so management pulled the plug. Also excused from service were the bellhop robots, after failing to access most guest rooms. And guests had flooded management with reports of clunky robot dancers in the lobby since the hotel first opened, but they're only now being show the door. It's not clear how many of the robots will be replaced with flesh-and-blood humans, but the hotel says it will now focus on bringing the human touch back, rather than perfecting robot service as a gimmick.
- There are other hotels in Asia experimenting with the all-robot model, including the multimillion dollar AliBaba Future Hotel in China, which just opened this week. But there are no plans as of now to operate an all-robot hotel anywhere in the United States, so if you're scared of our mechanical friends, you can breathe a sigh of relief - the robot apocalypse has been delayed...for now.

          / CBS News
- NAGASAKI, Japan -- The world's first hotel staffed almost entirely by robots is opening its doors full-time to guests this month, but CBS News correspondent Seth Doane has already been able to spend a night in the futuristic facility near the city of Nagasaki.
- Doane reports that the opening of a small, low-cost hotel doesn't usually warrant international attention -- even with gimmicks like drones, or the boss arriving via robotic platform.
- But the "Henn'na Hotel," which translates to "strange hotel" in Japanese, lives up to its name.
- "Please ask me your request, but don't ask me a difficult question because I am a robot," says the dinosaur behind the check-in desk.
- The English-speaking dinosaur robot is designed to appeal to kids. Also at reception, an almost creepy humanoid, programmed to speak Japanese, and of course, to bow in respect.
- There's a robotic bag-check, even a robot concierge.
- Hideo Sawada is the man in charge. Doane asked him if robots, which rely on a set of multiple choice responses to any question asked, could really replace staff like the hotel concierge, who has actually tasted food.
- "Isn't hospitality about connecting with people," Doane asked Sawada. "Isn't that an important part of the hotel business?"
- "For five-star hotels that are selling high-end service, human staff are essential," Sawada replied. "But for three or four star hotels, you need comfortable lodging, and a basic level of communication at a reasonable price."
- Sawada says having robots fill jobs can help reduce labor costs by about 70 percent. At the Henn'na, rooms start at only about $80 per night -- a pretty good deal in one of the most expensive countries in the world for travellers.
- The hotel boss admitted that the robotic staff "don't come cheap," but said that compared to an annual payroll for human personnel, "they are quite cost-effective... and as (technology) improves I think they will become quite price-competitive."
- In technology-crazed Japan, robots are becoming part of everyday life; from commercials, to appearances on TV as modern-day samurai. They're in stores greeting customers, and titillating tourists at Tokyo's famed "robot restaurant."
- Hotels were merely the next logical progression.
- There were some software hiccups as Doane checked in with the dinosaur-bot, but eventually he was off, to test the robot porter. He admitted he could probably have carried his bag himself, but given the option, "why not try another robot?"
- He punched his room number into a keypad on the machine, and it showed him to his room, albeit, slowly.
- Staring at his door, Doane was faced with another automation; facial recognition, in theory, replaces room keys at the Henn'na.
- After a few tries, he made it into his room -- no key necessary - to find another robot waiting for him.
- Unfortunately, that robot only spoke Japanese, and Doane's local lingo wasn't quite up to muster, so he had to rely on a provided "cheat sheet" to help with the wording. It couldn't do much for his pronunciation, but soon, Doane and robot were in synchronicity, and the electric room attendant turned off the lights so he could go to sleep.
