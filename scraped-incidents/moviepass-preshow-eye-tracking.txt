- Vice reports that MoviePass is returning as an app that will track users’ eyes when they watch adverts, leading commentators to question whether people would be willing to surrender their privacy to watch movies on a small screen.
- The new service is envisaged to use facial recognition and eye-tracking technology to ensure that viewers are looking directly at adverts in exchange for access to films.
- To earn movie tickets, users must keep their gaze in frame, and look at their screens for the whole ad. A red border appears if they look away, pausing the ads.
- MoviePass shuttered in 2019 and declared bankruptcy in 2020. In addition to its stuttering financial performance, it was plagued with numerous allegations of playing fast and loose with customer data.

- MoviePass, Inc. is an American subscription-based movie ticketing service[2][3] owned by co-founder Stacy Spikes.[4]
- The service was launched in 2011 and allowed subscribers to purchase up to a movie ticket a day for a monthly fee.[5] The service utilized a mobile app, where users check in to a theater and choose a movie and showtime, which resulted in the cost of the ticket being loaded to a prepaid debit card, which was used to purchase the ticket from the movie theater.
- In 2017, the service was acquired by Helios and Matheson Analytics (HMNY) and the subscription cost was significantly lowered to $9.95 per month. Membership ballooned to over three million subscribers by June 2018, but the service began to suffer from financial issues, which ultimately caused the service to shut down in September 2019. On January 28, 2020, MoviePass' parent company HMNY filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and announced that it had ceased all business operations.[6][7]
- On November 10, 2021, MoviePass co-founder Stacy Spikes was approved ownership of the company by a New York bankruptcy court judge. Spikes—who was fired from the company in 2018, shortly after it was acquired by HMNY—announced a relaunch of the service in 2022.
- MoviePass was founded in 2011 by technology and entertainment entrepreneurs Stacy Spikes and Hamet Watt.[8][9] It was backed by major investors including True Ventures, AOL Ventures, Lambert Media, Moxie Pictures and other investors.[10]
- The company launched in beta in June 2011 in San Francisco.[11] During initial trials, it encountered resistance from movie theater chains, resulting in the company going on a "temporary hiatus".[10] At first, MoviePass operated with a voucher system. Members printed a voucher on their home computers and redeemed them for movie tickets at participating cinemas. In August 2011, the company partnered with Hollywood Movie Money to conduct its service through its preexisting voucher program and cinema network.[12]
- The voucher system was replaced after users complained it was cumbersome. In October 2012, following a national beta test, the service switched to a mobile app and electronically preloaded prepaid card. While MoviePass claimed the card could be used at all cinemas that accepted major credit cards, there was still some hostility from the industry, including AMC Theatres, who publicly disassociated itself from the service.[13][14]
- In June 2016, MoviePass named Mitch Lowe, a former executive of Netflix and Redbox, as its new CEO. Lowe had been an advisor to the company since 2014.[15] Under Lowe, the service began to experiment with different pricing models; Lowe stated that his eventual goal was to have a low-end service at around $20 per month, ranging up towards a high-end service at around $100 with unlimited movies and availability of 3D screenings. In some regions, the service tried offering different subscription plans to users, such as a $50 plan for six movies per month, or $99 for unlimited—both allowing users to purchase tickets to 3D screenings. The new plans were criticized by those who felt that they were designed to gouge "unprofitable" frequent users of the service.[16][17]
- In July 2016, MoviePass unveiled a new plan structure effective in September, with tiers based on two, three, or unlimited movies per month. Prices vary by region, with (for example) the two-movie-per-month plan costing from $15 in small markets to $21 in larger ones. The unlimited plans were also modified to remove the previous restriction of one film every 24 hours, with prices ranging from $40 to $50 per month. Lowe argued that the new plans were designed to appeal to those who did not go to movies often.[18] In December 2016, the service had 20,000 subscribers.[19]
- Studio Movie Grill purchased a stake in the company in December 2016. MoviePass and Studio Movie Grill were also partnering on testing food features through the MoviePass app including OpenTable (purchases) and Explore More (menu).[20]
- In August 2017, a majority stake in MoviePass was sold to the analytics firm Helios and Matheson. At the same time, the company announced that it would lower its price for an unlimited plan allowing one film per-day, to $9.95 per month. Lowe explained that "after years of studying and analysis we found that people want to go to the movies more often, but the pricing keeps going up, and that prevents them from going more. We're making it more affordable for people." Helios and Matheson's CEO Ted Farnsworth stated the service wanted to increase the size of its userbase in order to analyze viewing habits for targeted advertising. Farnsworth compared the model to those of Facebook and Google, whose free services are subsidized by the collection of personal information for advertising.[21][8] After announcing their new pricing, the company's website went down due to the increase in traffic.[22] By September 2017, the number of subscribers had increased to 400,000, to 600,000 in mid-October, to one million in December, and two million in February 2018. In June 2018, the company announced in a press release that it had more than three million paying subscribers.[23][24][25]
- Helios advanced MoviePass $55 million from December to February 20, 2018. MoviePass then converted the advances from debt to capital. Helios ownership stake thus increased from 62.4 percent to 81.2 percent. Another $35 million in advances converted to capital put Helios to 91.8 percent allowing for a merger unilaterally initiated by the Helios board.[26] On January 19, 2018 at the Sundance Film Festival, MoviePass announced the new subsidiary MoviePass Ventures, which would co-acquire films with traditional distributors.[27][28]
- In February 2018, the price further dropped to $7.95 per month for new customers if they paid annually.[29] In March, they lowered it to $6.95.[30] In April 2018, Helios and Matheson acquired the movie listings website Moviefone from Verizon Communications's digital media subsidiary Oath Inc., with Verizon taking a stake in MoviePass stock.[31][32]
- Also in April 2018, MoviePass quietly removed the unlimited plan for new customers, and replaced it with a new plan limited to three movies per-month, bundled with a complimentary three-month trial of iHeartRadio All-Access. Lowe stated that he was not sure if the previous plan would be reinstated, explaining that "We just always try different things. Every time we try a new promotion, we never put a deadline on it."[33] There was also a change that prohibited MoviePass customers from buying multiple tickets to "select" movies.[34] The unlimited plan was reinstated two weeks later, with the limited plan maintained as a cheaper option at the $7.95 price point; Lowe stated that the company was "absolutely committed" to keeping the unlimited option.[35][36]
- In May 2018, MoviePass' cash expenses exceeded its revenues by $40 million and the company announced that it expected to run a deficit of $45 million in the month of June.[37][38] In late June 2018, Forbes reported that MoviePass was responding to the creation of the competitor AMC Stubs A-List by announcing new fees for its service, with surge fees added to popular films and prime timeslots.[38] The peak pricing rolled out was $2 to $6 extra during peak times. In the summer of 2018 the company launched a $164 million bond sale.[39][40] MoviePass said subscribers could waive one peak fee per month.[41] At the end of the month, MoviePass announced it would begin selling merchandise.[38]
- On July 2, Helios and Matheson Analytics filed to raise $1.2 billion to keep MoviePass solvent.[38] They filed to sell debt and securities.[42] Following a "service interruption" on July 26, the firm announced that it was forced to borrow $5 million in order to continue its operations; auditors doubted whether the company would be able to remain in business.[2] The weekend following this disruption, there were reports that screenings of Mission: Impossible – Fallout had been blacked out from the service.[43] The following Monday, the company announced it would not be offering its services for upcoming major releases, such as The Meg (which was projected to debut to about $20 million), but would continue operating for smaller films, albeit with the continued peak pricing.[44]
- On August 6, 2018, MoviePass backtracked on plans to raise its monthly fee from $9.95 to $14.95,[45] but announced that it would instead limit these subscribers to three free tickets per-month, with any further screening offering a $5 discount on the ticket price instead. MoviePass stated that this measure was intended to "protect the longevity of our company and prevent abuse of the service."[46] On August 16, 2018, MoviePass announced that it would also limit the service's film options to "up to six films to choose from daily, including a selection of major studio first-run films and independent releases".[47]
- By early August 2018, Helios and Matheson completed the acquisition of Emmett Furla Oasis Films assets for the MoviePass subsidiary, MoviePass Films.[48] On August 24, 2018, MoviePass announced that it had ceased providing its previous annual unlimited plan, with all subscribers transitioned to the monthly limited plan. Subscribers who do not wish to have this plan were instructed to cancel their subscriptions by August 31, 2018 to receive a pro-rated refund (as per the MoviePass terms of service, users who cancel their subscription may not re-join the service for 9 months).[49] By October, reportedly over a million subscribers had cancelled the service, and by April 2019, paying subscribers had fallen over 90% from its peak, to 225,000.[50][51]
- In November 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed[by whom?] in San Francisco for not following through on its promises via blacking out various popular movies. On February 2, 2019, another was filed[by whom?] in New York state court against MoviePass for bait-and-switch.[52]
- The company announced its closure on September 14, 2019 because "efforts to recapitalize MoviePass have not been successful to date."[53] On September 17, 2019, Ted Farnsworth resigned as MoviePass CEO and chairman while placing an offer for MoviePass assets and related businesses: Moviefone, MoviePass Films production company, MoviePass Ventures film co-acquisition unit.[54]
- On November 10, 2021, a bankruptcy judge allowed the sale of the company back to one of the original founders, Stacy Spikes. Spikes has announced that the company is exploring a relaunch.[55]
- In August 2022, after co-founder Stacy Spikes reacquired the company, Spikes announced the service would relaunch. Its new pricing model would be a tiered system, with $10, $20, and $30 options, with variation by market. The firm announced there would be a waitlist with a limited number of users under its beta model, and its launch would differ from region to region based on engagement.[56][57][58][59][60]
- In September 2022, Insider reported that the Moviepass' beta relaunch will kick off in Chicago, Dallas and Kansas City starting on Labor Day, adding that the subscribers can watch up to five movies in a month. A week prior to this announcement, the company said that more than 775,000 people signed up to the waitlist.[61]
- In January 2023, MoviePass raised seed financing led by Animoca Brands for an undisclosed amount. MoviePass said it plans to use the new funding to accelerate the beta relaunch of its movie theatre subscription service, and to develop and implement the company's Web3 strategy, which includes virtual reality cinema experiences and using technology to drive traffic to theaters. As of January 2023, the MoviePass beta version is live in nine U.S. markets including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Oklahoma City and Tampa Bay.[62]
- MoviePass was named as one of the "25 Most Disruptive Apps of 2012" and part of "The Best of Everything in 2012" by Business Insider.[63][64] The 2017 change in business model was successful in attracting customers; the service reported having 2 million subscribers in February 2018. That same month, the company announced at the Sundance Film Festival that it would also acquire and distribute films under the new subsidiary, MoviePass Ventures.
- Subscribers to MoviePass were issued a branded prepaid debit card. Using the MoviePass mobile app, users checked-in at a supported cinema, and selected a film and showtime occurring within the next 30 minutes; the card was automatically loaded with the amount of money needed to purchase a single ticket from the cinema for that film. The user then purchased their ticket as usual, using their MoviePass card as their payment method.[65] Hence, the service was subsidizing the purchase of tickets directly from the cinema by the customer. Some cinemas supported e-tickets through MoviePass.[66][21][67] MoviePass said that its service was supported at 91% of U.S. cinemas. One regional dine-in chain, Studio Movie Grill, made an investment in MoviePass, and partnered to pilot features such as food ordering from within the app.[68]
- The service went through several pricing structures following its original invite-only launch (including those limited to two or three films per month, and "unlimited" plans, with pricing based on market size), before announcing in August 2017 that it would switch to offering a plan with a single film per day priced at $9.95 per month.[69] The change in business model came with the acquisition of a majority stake in the company by an analytics firm, which sought to widen the service's reach so it could collect more information on customer viewing habits.
- The MoviePass service had several limitations. It could not be used for screenings in specialty formats such as 3D or IMAX. The service also did not support advance purchase of tickets, and only allowed solo purchases.[66][70][67] Effective April 2018, a user could only use MoviePass on a particular film once.[71] As of July 2018, certain screenings had possible additional fees based on demand.[72]
- The business model of MoviePass faced notable resistance from major cinema chains since its launch; the company's 21-theatre pilot in San Francisco was called off after objections by AMC Theatres and Landmark Theatres, who were included in the slate of locations without their knowledge. Stacy Spikes explained to Deadline Hollywood that he "imagine[d] a day where studio executives can see real-time decisions that subscribers are making from their phones and devices. If studios say they are not interested in being able to talk to their customers, knowing what they are thinking and being able to notify them of things like ancillary items, and that theater owners aren't interested in having these people go to the movies more, and drive up concessions sales, and having us put all this in the palms of their hands, then I'm in the wrong business."[10]
- Following the announcement of MoviePass' new pricing model in August 2017, AMC stated that it was "actively working now to determine whether it may be feasible to opt out and not participate in this shaky and unsustainable program", as "by definition and absent some other form of other compensation, MoviePass will be losing money on every subscriber seeing two movies or more in a month", and that lowering its prices in response to the service would harm the customer experience.[73] The service's original pricing depended on a business model similar to those of health clubs, where the company would profit more if customers paid for the service but only used it on occasion.[8][73] On March 13, 2019, MoviePass executive VP Khalid Itum departed the company. Itum had assumed day-to-day control of the service since November 2018.[74]
- In an effort to limit costs during the height of the service's popularity, MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe directed the product team to implement three programs that were designed to artificially throttle users' benefits. First, they forcibly reset the passwords for approximately 75,000 of the most active user accounts under the false pretense of detecting "suspicious activity".[75][76][77] When these users tried to change their passwords, the system would be non-functional, leading to service outages of a week or more.[75] Second, they implemented a "random" audit process where some users would be required to take a photograph of their ticket stub to verify that they had actually watched the movie. In truth, these audits targeted the 450,000 most active users and the verification process was prone to errors, sometimes leading to closure of the account.[75] Third, they added a hidden "trip wire" for users who saw more than three movies in a month which prevented them from using the service at all when this undisclosed limit was reached.[75][78] Other executives who were aware of the programs feared consumer backlash and a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation if they were ever discovered.[75] The FTC filed a legal complaint against MoviePass over these deceptive business practices, who chose to settle the case in 2021.[79]
- On August 20, 2019, cybersecurity firm SpiderSilk informed MoviePass of a data breach involving sensitive data including credit card numbers for tens of thousands of MoviePass users.[80]
- On January 19, 2018 at the Sundance Film Festival, MoviePass announced the new subsidiary MoviePass Ventures, which would co-acquire films with traditional distributors. Lowe explained that the company wanted to "bring great films to the big screen across the country for our subscribers", and that "given the successes we have demonstrated for our distributor partners in ensuring strong box office in the theatrical window, it's only natural for us to double down and want to play alongside them – and share in the upside."[27][28]
- MoviePass Ventures' first acquisition (in partnership with The Orchard), Bart Layton's American Animals, was on June 1, 2018, while their second, Gotti starring John Travolta as the titular mob boss, was released on June 15, 2018.[81] The MoviePass Venture operation was questioned by some in the industry, with one independent studio head telling Deadline Hollywood: "It used to be in distribution, we'd all gossip whether a studio was buying tickets to their own movie to goose their opening, but in the case of MoviePass, there's no secret: They're literally buying the tickets to their own movie".[82] According to MoviePass' own reports, the service made up 25–35% of American Animals' opening weekend ticket sales, and around 40% of Gotti's.[83]
- It was noted that the MoviePass Ventures film Gotti had large disparities between critic and audience scores on Rotten Tomatoes, with most of the positive reviews coming from new users, and those whose only other review was of fellow release American Animals. This led to allegations that MoviePass was attempting to manipulate reviews in order to bolster the service.[84][85]
- In May 2018, Helios and Matheson Analytics, the parent company of MoviePass, acquired the option to purchase the assets of Emmett/Furla Oasis plus gain its executives' expertise in making films for a new subsidiary, MoviePass Films. The new company would be 51% owned by Helios and the remainder by EFO.[86] By early August 2018, Helios and Matheson completed the acquisition of Emmett Furla Oasis Films assets for the MoviePass subsidiary, MoviePass Films. The first film produced under the MoviePass Films was announced to be 10 Minutes Gone starring Bruce Willis,[87] which the first of a three film pact with Willis.[88] In late September 2018, the company acquired equity stakes and co-distribution in two films distributed by Neon to be released soon.[89]
- In March 2019, The Boies/Schiller Film Group filed suit on Tuesday, accusing Emmett/Furla Oasis Films of breaching a deal to produce  Escape Plan sequels starring Sylvester Stallone. According to the suit, Boies/Schiller put up a $6 million loan for the $65 million project. The arrangement also gave Boies/Schiller rights to finance and produce the sequels, Escape Plan 2: Hades and Escape Plan: The Extractors. Boies/Schiller alleges that Emmett/Furla Oasis Films breached that agreement, and did not allow Boies/Schiller to put up financing for the sequels. The suit claims Emmett/Furla also failed to pay an executive producing fee on each of the two movies.[90]
- Oasis Ventures Entertainment sued MoviePass Films on October 14, 2019 over the theft of films and for lack of consent from Oasis in making the deal with Helios and Matheson.[91]
- MoviePass Films was the final company to bear the MoviePass name after MoviePass was shut down in 2020, thus being Boss Level the last released film of the company in 2021. Originally they had acquired American Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally but after its closure they will no longer produce it, the rights of the film were transferred to Vertical Entertainment and  Redbox Entertainment.

- MoviePass is relaunching as a web3-style application where users earn credits to go to the movies by watching ads. The new MoviePass will use facial recognition and eye tracking tech in your phone to make sure that you’re actually watching those ads.
- MoviePass has been around since 2011, but really took off in 2016 when it launched a program where users could pay a flat fee to see unlimited movies in the theater. A lot of people saw a lot of movies cheaply, and the system was never quite sustainable. It died in 2019 and declared bankruptcy in 2020 after several attempts to keep it afloat fell flat.
- Now co-founder Stacy Spikes is back in charge and MoviePass 2.0 is here. Spikes detailed his plan during a relaunch event on February 10.
- The new MoviePass is leaning into all the latest Silicon Valley buzzwords—web3, wallets, and play to earn schemes. Spikes—wearing the standard black turtleneck, jeans, and tennis shoes associated with Steve Jobs and Elizabeth Holmes—announced that MoviePass is moving towards a system where people watch ads to earn virtual currency that they then spend on movies.
- “It’s a way to close that loop and make it far more efficient of a system,” Spikes said. “I want to be able to see it for free. Advertisers have put a pre-show together not unlike what you’d normally see when you go to a movie theater but this is customized for you.”
- Spikes said that all of this will happen locally on the users phone. “Part of the direction we’re doing from a web3 perspective is, this is happening only on your phone, uniquely to you, and the credits that are earned are your credits that go into your virtual wallet that you get to spend,” he said. “So it’s your own money.”
- The new MoviePass will also use your phone's cameras to make sure that you’re actually watching the ads. “As I’m looking at it, it’s playing back. But if I stop and I’m not paying attention to it, it actually pauses the content,” Spikes said while watching an ad during the presentation. “We had an early version of this where you know what happened. People put the phone down and left and didn’t pay any attention to it. Right now 70 percent of video advertising is unseen. This is a way that advertisers get the impact they’re looking for but you’re also getting the impact yourself.”
- Spikes described a world in which people could purchase products advertised to them directly through the MoviePass app and earn more credits towards free films. He also said MoviePass will open up some of the company to equity investment from members. Buy a big enough stake in the company and you earn benefits, including a lifetime membership.
- This technology is going to launch this summer. Only time will tell if people are willing to let their phone track their eyes as they watch ads so they can see Spider-Man for free.

- MoviePass, a service that let users watch movies inexpensively but shut down in 2019, is returning as an app that will track users’ eyes when they watch adverts.
- The new service will use facial recognition and eye-tracking technology to ensure that viewers eyes are looking at promoted content in exchange for access to films.
- “It’s a way to close that loop and make it far more efficient of a system,” co-founder Stacy Spikes said, as reported by Motherboard.
- “I want to be able to see it for free. Advertisers have put a pre-show together not unlike what you’d normally see when you go to a movie theater but this is customized for you.”
- The tracking will happen only on the user’s device with the digital currency then going to a virtual wallet. The facial recognition algorithm, using the phones’ cameras, will make sure the user is not ignoring the advert.
- “As I’m looking at it, it’s playing back. But if I stop and I’m not paying attention to it, it actually pauses the content,” Spikes said.
- “We had an early version of this where you know what happened. People put the phone down and left and didn’t pay any attention to it. Right now 70 percent of video advertising is unseen. This is a way that advertisers get the impact they’re looking for but you’re also getting the impact yourself.”
- In the future, people would be able to buy products that were advertised to them through the MoviePass app and earn more credits to watch more films. It is reported that this technology will be available in the summer.
- MoviePass shut down in September 2019 after two years following a price drop in its subscription plan that let users buy a movie ticket per day for only $10 per month. That decision, to the financial detriment of the company, came after analytics firm Helios and Matheson purchased a majority share in the company and fired Mr Spikes.
- Mr Spikes said the new MoviePass will be “powered by web3 technology.” Web3 has been characterised by its advocates as a mesh of blockchain technologies such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs that will become the next iteration of the internet. Others have criticised it as a power-grab by venture capitalists.
- One of the claimed benefits of Web3 is that users can have power over how a digital service is run. For MoviePass, that would be through users being able to hold partial ownership of the company and the most premium tier including a lifetime subscription. Mr Spikes said that he intended to run the business like a “co-op”.

- MoviePass, the theater subscription service, that shut down in 2019, is being resurrected, and will come with an ad service that tracks eye movements.
- The original service allowed movie fans to watch an unlimited number of films for $10 a month. It proved popular but failed to make any money for its owners.
- This time it will be in the form of a tiered service, charging 'credits' for access to movies, rather than offering unlimited access - with the number of credits required, based on popularity and what time a film might be showing at the theater.
- There will be a number of tiers, with each one offering more 'base credits', but users will be able to trade credits with other users, purchase more, or earn more by watching a series of ads within the MoviePass app.
- However, the advertising software will come with eyeball tracking technology that ensures they are actually watching the commercial, and not looking elsewhere.
- The service is set to launch this summer, but details of pricing, or exactly how many credits a movie will cost, have yet to be released.

- Stacy Spikes, founder of MoviePass, announced the plans for the compulsory advertising within the software at an event in New York, pitching it as a way for viewers to cash in on ad consumption - swapping time for free films.
- He is adding PreShow, software he launched in 2019 to offer free movies in return for watching 15 minute advertising spots, into the next generation of MoviePass.
- PreShow requires users to watch the entire 15 minute spot, rather than just have it running in the background, to ensure advertisers get value for their money.
- Each ad viewed all the way through would earn credits, that could be traded for access to a movie in a theater - although the conversation rate isn't clear.
- 'It basically creates a transaction between you and the brand,' Spikes told Motherboard.
- It makes use of higher resolution front facing cameras on smartphones, and facial recognition technology, to know who is watching, and when they are watching.
- He showed an ad for a taxi firm during a presentation in New York, where if the user turned their eyes from the screen, the ad paused.
- 'We had an earlier version of [MoviePass], where — you know what happened — people put the phone down, left, didn't pay any attention to it,' he said.
- Spikes described PreShow as a 'natural extension of advertising in movies', allowing viewers to benefit directly from the commercials they have to watch.

- PreShow is a 'free movie' ticketing service, that works through ads.
- Users are shown a 15 minute advertising spot, and in return for watching it all the way through, they get a free movie theater ticket.
- It was developed by Stacy Spikes, who co-founded the ill-fated theater subscription service, MoviePass.
- To stop users just clicking the ad, then going away to do something else for 15 minutes, they added eye tracking.
- 'We had to build in facial recognition so that you can tell that the person actually watched,' said Spikes.
- 'If I look away, it can detect that. It'll pause if it doesn't see me for five seconds. '
- In an interview with AP, Spikes added that: 'Nothing is recording. It's a motion detector.
- 'There is nothing leaving your device, nothing stored. (All advertisers get) is this many people watched these spots.'
- 'It takes the middleman out, versus people selling your data and giving away information for you to have access to things. We're going to empower that that happens directly to you,' he explained.
- In a demonstration of the feature, it appears as an option next to a movie page, offering viewers the chance to get it for free, or at least get credits towards it.
- The credits work like a virtual currency, that users can then spend on movies, explained Spikes, describing it as being able to offer free films, while also ensuring advertisers who are effectively paying for that movie - get value for their money.
- The tracking software works within the device, using the users mobile phone camera to monitor eye movements, and feed it back into the software.
- “Part of the direction we’re doing from a web3 perspective is, this is happening only on your phone, uniquely to you, and the credits that are earned are your credits that go into your virtual wallet that you get to spend,” he told Vice.
- The credit system will act like a marketplace, where individual theaters can compete against each other to offer different products for different credit levels.
- Users will be able to roll over unused credits to the next month, and use their credits to take a friend, loved one or colleague to the theater.
- Part of that Web3 play will mean users can trade their credits, like a virtual currency, with other users who may need more, while you need fewer credits.
- There will be tiered plans, where you pay different amounts, not currently disclosed, for varying levels of credits - with the option to buy, trade for and earn more credits as needed - including earning them by watching ads.
- This time it will be in the form of a tiered service, charging 'credits' for access to movies, rather than offering unlimited access - with the number of credits required, based on popularity and what time a film might be showing at the theater
- The number of credits required for a movie will vary depending on the time of day, popularity of the movie and demand.
- The first generation of MoviePass launched in 2011 and was acquired by data firm Helios and Matheson Analytics in 2017, dropping the monthly price for unlimited movies to $10 a month.
- While this allowed them to grow subscribers, hitting three million within a year, it quickly burned through its cash reserves, and the subscription failed to match the cost involved in providing movie access.
- Spikes bought his company back in 2021 for $14,000, working with an initial 200 users - those at the New York event who were given a free subscription.

- MoviePass is back, and it already sounds horrific.
- Unskippable ads are annoying, right? My fellow British YouTube watchers have probably heard enough of the Just Eat ads to last a lifetime. But at least you don't actually have to pay attention to them, right?
- Well, thanks to MoviePass rearing its controversial head once more, we might not be able to say that for much longer. The MoviePass 2.0 app is set to launch this summer, and will sustain itself using microcurrency and ads. However, unlike ads on any other platform, you will be forced to actually watch them, as they'll only play when your eyes are looking at the screen.
- Related: It Takes Two Is Getting The Movie Treatment, So Who Should Make The Cast?
- MoviePass 2.0 was explained in a presentation yesterday by CEO Stacy Spikes, with Tom's Guide providing an overview of how it will work. Rather than just pay a monthly subscription as you would with the previous iteration of the app, this time you can earn virtual currency to spend on films. You earn these tokens by watching ads, with your phone's camera making sure you're actually paying attention to them.
- There seems to be no information on how this will work with those who wear glasses, or people with disabilities. Presumably, the phone will have to be held to your face while the ad is playing, rather than propped up on a table away from you. Not every user will have the strength or dexterity to hold their phone to their face long enough for ads to play out. Users with Nystagmus may find that the software is unable to detect their rapid eye movements.
- Stacy Spikes is remaining tight-lipped on the pricing, but there will be tiered subscription plans. It is not known if everyone will have to sit through the dystopian ad integration regardless of their tier, but it would solve the original MoviePass' biggest problem from a business standpoint. With a flat rate of $10 a month, and users able to watch up to three films in that time, the service would only make money if users forgot about their membership and didn't use it as intended. Which they didn't. Under the new system, MoviePass can continue to monetize its users even if they're vexing enough to actually use the service they pay for.
- MoviePass 2.0 is set to go live this summer, if you feel like diving headfirst into a late-stage capitalist nightmare.

- Two years after going bankrupt, MoviePass is being reborn.
- Instead of allowing users to watch unlimited films for $10 a month — a business model that drew customers but failed to yield profits — the new MoviePass will offer a tiered service, with movies costing "credits" based on their popularity and screening time. Another twist: When the service relaunches this summer, subscribers will be able to earn credits by watching ads on their phone — provided they allow the software to track their eye movements to ensure they're watching the ads.
- MoviePass founder Stacy Spikes laid out his vision for the ad-watching service at an event last week at New York City's Lincoln Center. Spikes, who previously raised $56,000 on Kickstarter for the ad-watching program, dubbed PreShow, pitched it as a way for viewers to cash in on their ad consumption in exchange for free films. According to Spikes, the spots on PreShow are just like ads that play before a movie in theaters, but personalized based on the viewer's interests.
- "It basically creates a transaction between you and the brand," he said, adding, "What's cool about this is your phone, your device, uses your own facial detection."
- Spikes demonstrated the software by watching an ad for a taxi service that detected when he turned away and paused the ad until he returned. That approach prevents moviegoers from cheating the system, he explained.
- "We had an earlier version of this, where — you know what happened — people put the phone down, left, didn't pay any attention to it," he said.
- According to a spokesperson representing MoviePass, the ad-watching software will work on any phone with a camera. The company has not yet shared details on how much it will charge for its new service.
- Given that the vast majority of video viewers choose to skip ads, it's not clear how many moviegoers will subject themselves to ads in exchange for free flicks. But to hear Spikes' pitch, the software will have at least one enthusiastic user: himself.
- "I love product placement in movies. I love the cars, I love the watches, I love the clothes," he told the audience Thursday. "I sometimes have a notepad and I'm writing down, 'Is that Hugo Boss?' and I'm on the computer trying to figure out, what suit is he wearing? I'm that guy."
- According to Spikes, PreShow is a natural extension of advertising in movies, an industry that rakes in tens of billions of dollars every year. He also argued that, because moviegoers could opt into the program, they benefitted from it directly.
- "It takes the middleman out, versus people selling your data and giving away information for you to have access to things. We're going to empower that that happens directly to you," he said.
- MoviePass launched in 2011 and grew slowly for half a decade. In 2017, it was acquired by Helios and Matheson Analytics, a data firm. The new owners dropped MoviePass' monthly subscription fee to bargain-basement $10 a month in a bid to grow its membership.
- The move worked. In a few months, MoviePass had 1 million subscribers, and a year later it hit 3 million. What that strategy didn't do was churn out profits. MoviePass tried raising the price and putting restrictions  on what members could see, but by then it had burned through most of its cash. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 2020.
- Late last year, Spikes bought his company back for just $14,000, according to the Wall Street Journal. Spikes' goal, which he admits is a "moonshot," is to enroll 30% of American moviegoers into MoviePass by 2030. For now, he has at least 200 users: The attendees at Thursday's announcement each received a free yearlong subscription.

- MoviePass, a service allowing users to watch movies for cheap, is returning – but will come with a somewhat concerning twist.
- If you want to "buy" movies with digital currency earned by using their upcoming app, you’ll need to watch adverts. However, you can’t just put on the ads while you make a coffee – instead, the app will have eye-tracking software ensuring you are actually watching. Look away, and it will pause until it has your undivided attention.
- “It’s a way to close that loop and make it far more efficient of a system,” said Stacy Spikes, co-founder of MoviePass, reports Motherboard.
- “I want to be able to see it for free. Advertisers have put a pre-show together not unlike what you’d normally see when you go to a movie theater but this is customized for you.” Related StoriesNew York Lawyer Caught Using ChatGPT After Citing Cases That Don't ExistShould We All Be Meditating? Find Out In Issue 11 Of CURIOUS – Out NowGoodbye, WinRAR: Windows Is Finally Adding This Much-Wanted Feature
- MoviePass states the intention is to prevent advertisers’ content from going unseen, whilst providing users the opportunity to directly purchase movies from watching ads.
- “We had an early version of this where you know what happened. People put the phone down and left and didn’t pay any attention to it. Right now 70 percent of video advertising is unseen. This is a way that advertisers get the impact they’re looking for but you’re also getting the impact yourself,” continued Spikes.
- The technology will constantly utilize your phone camera and facial recognition to ensure your eyes are exactly where advertisers want them. Through this, the user will earn credits that go into their own wallet, which can be used to buy movies, products on the app, and possibly even stake in the company in the future.
- MoviePass will launch with the new app this Summer. Would you let your eyes be tracked for cheaper movies?

- Stacy Spikes just wants to get people to the movies. As the co-founder and CEO of MoviePass, he helped popularize the idea of cinema subscriptions. (This was before MoviePass brought in a new CEO and his ambitious -- but ultimately unsustainable -- $10 monthly plan.) As he pondered his next endeavor, he started noticing just how many ads we're subjected to in theaters, something that seems especially egregious as ticket prices keep climbing. And that's not counting the product placement we see in films.
- What if you could watch commercials and actually get rewarded for it? That's how PreShow was born. It's an app that lets you earn free movie tickets for watching 15 to 20 minutes of branded content on your phone. That could include movie trailers, behind the scenes features and interactive experiences from related companies. PreShow is launching its Kickstarter campaign today, which lets you snag some early spots on the service, as well as invites for your friends, starting at $60. (There are also $25 and $15 tiers that will get access later this year.)
- 
- Getting stuff in exchange for seeing ads isn't a new concept -- remember NetZero and Juno? -- but PreShow is handling it in entirely new ways. For one, it relies on Apple's FaceID to log into its iOS app, which helps to prevent fraud. (That was a common problem for MoviePass, since there were a plethora of ways for people to share accounts.) And I'm sure you're asking yourself, what if you just start playing a PreShow ad and walk away? That's where things get interesting.
- The company has developed a way to track your gaze to make sure you're actually looking at the PreShow commercial. The app also places a green border around the edges of your screen to confirm that it sees you. If you look away for too long, or leave your seat, the ad automatically pauses and you'll get a red border around your screen. You can later continue watching whenever you like. While Spikes demoed the app, it could easily tell when he was glancing away. And when he looked at the screen again, the ad restarted almost instantly.
- Obviously, a precaution like this is necessary to prevent people from completely ignoring PreShow's ads. But it opens a Black Mirror-like door that could get downright dystopian quickly. Just imagine being forced to stare at a commercial before you could see a YouTube video or read an article online. PreShow's gaze tracking technology is patent-pending, and Spikes says he's only aiming to use it to ensure the integrity of the service. But really, there's no telling where this technology could eventually go.
- Once you've completed a PreShow sequence, you'll earn points that can be redeemed for a ticket to the associated movie. So far, the service only supports 2D showings, but Spikes says they're working on alternative screenings like 3D and IMAX. There aren't any blackout periods, and you'll be able to watch a PreShow twice to earn points for two tickets. You'll actually have to use those tickets before you can watch that film's ads again, though. As for buying tickets, you can either do that with the app's virtual credit card, or you can request a physical card in the mail for a fee. PreShow will be testing out different methods based on user feedback.
- Since this is an advertising-driven platform, data will be a big selling point for marketers. Spikes says they'll only get anonymized data confirming that you've finished watching a commercial. But of course, the PreShows themselves can be gateways for more information. A car maker could offer you more points when you sign up for a test drive through the app, for example. Spikes says PreShow could also be an avenue for for studios to communicate with consumers. After seeing a film, they could create a survey for you to fill out and earn more points. (It seems like a more convenient idea than the film survey companies that camp out in cinemas.)

- PreShow doesn't have a public launch date in mind yet -- for now, it's aiming to open up for $60 level Kickstarter backers around July, who will each be able to invite 30 of their friends. The second wave of backers should get access to the app in September, along with 10 invites. And it'll open up to the third wave in November with 5 invites.
- Even though the main conceit of the app is free movie tickets, Spikes still isn't sure what PreShow will cost when it launches for everyone. It could involve a nominal fee to join up, a small monthly subscription, or it could be completely free. It all depends on what the company sees from its early users.
- As someone who has followed MoviePass since its early days, it was always clear Spikes was onto something. (I've moved over to AMC's A-List service, but he was spot on that cinema subscriptions could work.) There's a similar sense with PreShow. Plenty of people wouldn't mind sitting through 15 to 20 minutes of ads if it means seeing the latest Marvel film for free. But, like MoviePass, PreShow could also encourage users to take a chance on entirely new types of films. In the end, that could be great for cinema and theaters alike.

- The founder of MoviePass is back, and this time he's not messing around.
- MoviePass co-founder Stacy Spikes has a new startup called PreShow, and it's using a business model straight out of "A Clockwork Orange": The company's new app helps you score free movie tickets — as long as you sit through 15 to 20 minutes of advertisements that use eye-tracking technology to make sure you don't look away.
- Unlike YouTube ads, which can be skipped after a few seconds or blocked with a third-party extension, PreShow demands your attention. To use the app, according to Engadget, you have to sign in with Apple's FaceID. And you can't just walk away or let your attention wander — the app watches you to make sure you’re paying attention.
- To earn the movie tickets, you have to keep your gaze in frame, and look at your screen for the entire duration of the ads. Look away, or put your phone down, and a red border appears, pausing the ads until you give in and return.
- Spikes says he doesn't plan on licensing the ad-pushing technology anywhere outside of PreShow, Engadget reports.
- But that doesn't mean executives don't plan to cash out. Right now, the app is still gathering backers via a Kickstarter. Once it's released, it's possible that the app — which, again, forces people to watch a TV-episode length slew of advertisements — could be available only through a monthly subscription.

- “There was a time, not so long ago, when you could see basically any movie in basically any theater for a flat rate of $10 a month” sounds like a tall tale a grizzled old timer would tell children around a campfire after civilization collapses. But it was real, it was called MoviePass, and it was a system in which venture capitalists subsidized 3 million users’ moviegoing at a loss of hundreds of millions of their own dollars. It was an affordable public good but an extremely stupid business, so the app shuttered in September 2019. But just like an inflatable clown-shaped punching bag, you can’t keep a ridiculous Silicon Valley idea down.
- At a press conference at Lincoln Center on Thursday, MoviePass co-founder and CEO Stacy Spikes announced that the app is coming back in beta with some significant changes. It looks like MoviePass will operate more like ClassPass with tiered plans that give you a certain amount of credits and with different movies at different times, dates, and locations costing varying numbers of credits. Spikes said credits will roll over, and users will be permitted to use them on buying a second ticket for a filmgoing companion. He didn’t say what the pricing will be, but this all sounds fairly reasonable.
- The scary part comes in with the introduction of a new feature called PreShow, which plays ads in the app. “What’s cool about this,” Spikes said, wearing a Steve Jobs black turtleneck, “is that your phone, your device, uses your own facial detection.” He demonstrates this by starting up an ad on his phone. “If I’m looking at it, it’s playing back, but if I stopped, and I’m not paying attention to it, it actually pauses the content,” he explained. In return for watching an ad without looking away, a user gets credits to put toward a movie. Spikes frames this as empowering. Instead of MoviePass selling your data to advertisers, the advertisers buy ad-space on the app. He said it’s basically Web3 because the “transaction between you and the brand” is localized on your phone and, in return, you get “virtual currency” (movie credits) for your “digital wallet” (your plan to watch Marry Me on Valentine’s Day).
- Except this is literally the same tech as the dystopian screen-based sleeping pods in the Black Mirror episode “Fifteen Million Merits,” in which the surveillance-enabled screens blasting sleep-disrupting ads can tell when an employee covers their eyes and force them to watch. PreShow is an opt-in service within MoviePass; you don’t have to use it (yet), but it’s a way of voluntarily selling your attention as labor in exchange for credits. The implications of this are bleak; imagine a YouTube video not playing until you watch a Noom spot, pausing and restarting if you glance away. The invasion of privacy doesn’t seem worth it … Maybe for free tickets to Marry Me.

- MoviePass, the relatively short-lived service that allowed theatergoers to watch an unlimited number of movies with a flat fee before shutting down in 2019, is planning a revival this summer with some potentially controversial technologies.
- As reported by Motherboard, MoviePass 2.0 will be very different from its predecessor for not only being a web3-style application, but one that allows users to watch ads to earn credits for movies. There’s a significant catch, however: users need to keep their smartphone cameras out, as MoviePass will be tracking their eyeballs to ensure they are actually watching the advertisements.
- MoviePass 2.0’s relaunch was detailed by co-founder Stacy Spikes last week, who took to the stage at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center in NYC to convince moviegoers and investors as to why the new iteration of the service won’t be a disappointment like its predecessor. The credits that MoviePass 2.0 users earn by watching ads are being referred to as a virtual currency.

- When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
- MoviePass 2.0? It's back and it's coming this summer
- I said it, and I'm sure others did too: "MoviePass 2.0? Really?" MoviePass, the once-unlimited buffet of movie tickets for a monthly fee, is back — but a lot has changed since the original MoviePass died. Co-founder CEO Stacy Spikes announced the return to press assembled at New York City's Walter Reade Theater today (Feb, 10).
- The presentation, which will not disappoint anyone who is suspicious of this return, saw Spikes talk about cameras tracking your eyes, the nebulous term "Web3" and even a credits-based virtual currency. You can watch it for yourself below, but I'll do my best to break it down for you.
- Spikes, who bought the company out of bankruptcy, spoke to an applauding crowd, but his proposal seems curious and unfinished. Spikes delivered his presentation, though, with confidence based on the demand for MoviePass 1.0. According to Spikes, 3 million MoviePass users saw 50 million movies in 4,000 theaters, amounting to 4% of the market share in the U.S.; he also claimed that MoviePass drove substantial amounts of traffic to independent theaters. That would make MoviePass the second-ranked exhibitor by Spikes' math.
- We now know that MoviePass's beta is expected to launch on Labor Day and that it will cost between $10 and $30. We also know that if you want to access the beta you will need to sign up for the waitlist between August 25 and August 29.
- In full disclosure, I'm a former MoviePass member, but not a part of any class-action lawsuits that went after the company. I would love MoviePass 2.0 to be the rebirth of the original. But how is MoviePass 2.0 supposed to work? If you're wondering the same thing, brace yourselves here for a lot of buzzwords that didn't get explanations.
- Spikes said that MoviePass 2.0 will work with an "end-to-end cinematic marketplace," that uses Web3 technology. The benefits of this Web3 involvement supposedly include power, control and freedom.
- MoviePass 2.0 will be based around a virtual currency of credits, which will roll over month to month. One upgrade over MoviePass 1.0 is that you'll also be able to bring a friend without requiring a new membership tier. Oddly, you'll be able to "trade" credits between users. The dev team is still working on the details of that, Spikes said.
- 
- After Spikes claimed you’ll be more in control of your privacy, he introduced something called PreShow. That would help companies speak to customers directly while showing a bunch of fashionable print ads.
- This is when things got very Black Mirror. Remember Fifty Million Merits, the episode where people use exercise bikes to get points to remove ads from their cubicle homes? MoviePass 2.0's PreShow feature will let you watch ads — and the cameras in your phone will track your face and eyes so it makes sure you're watching — in order to get credits for movies.
- 
- Spikes didn't say how many ads you need to watch to get to see a movie for free.
- MoviePass 2.0, Spikes said, was meant to be "built by its fanbase," and he compared it to a co-op. The users, he said, are supposed to be the owners. Portions of the company will be available for investment, and registration is open at the moment. Perks will include lifetime membership, according to Spikes.
- MoviePass 2.0 will assign different numbers of its token-based credits to different showtimes, so "off-peak" matinee times are cheaper than "peak" time evening tickets.
- In a recent email, MoviePass revealed that the beta will launch on Labor Day (September 5). To get in on the beta, you will need to sign up for the waitlist. The waitlist officially opens on MoviePass’s website at 9 a.m. ET/6 a.m. PT on August 25 and closes at 11:59 p.m. ET/8:59 p.m. PT.
- There are three pricing tiers: $10, $20 and $30 a month. Each tier will receive a set amount of credits, but we do not know how many credits each tier gets. Nowhere in Spike's February presentation did he use the word "unlimited," so we expect there will be limits to how many movies users can watch.
- In February, Spikes said MoviePass 2.0 will have "partnering theaters," that allow you to pick your seat in the MoviePass app. Theaters will be able to promote offers to consumers through MoviePass 2.0 if the customer is no longer going as often, which wasn't available before.
- We now know that MoviePass is expected to work with all major movie theaters that accept credit cards in your area. While MoviePass does not list specific theaters, we expect theaters from AMC Entertainment, Regal Cinemas and Cinemark will be included.
- Below, you can see the four sample screens of the MoviePass 2.0 app, with windows for selecting moves and showtimes. Here, you can see the varying credits per showtime.
- 
- At the event, Spikes gave a history of MoviePass and a sort of blueprint for MoviePass 2.0, starting off with laughs about the change of management and how catastrophic MoviePass' failure was. With a graphic of a flaming phoenix rising from the ashes behind him, Spikes tries to explain what happened to renew confidence, acknowledging those who lost money, as well as those who lost trust and were hurt and disappointed.
- He then spoke to the "seasoned entrepreneurs" who he believed caused a lot of the problems. Watch it for yourself, including the part when he talks about "sitting at home feeling sorry for [himself]."
- Spikes even proposed a "moonshot" goal of 30% of moviegoers (by 2030) becoming MoviePass subscribers, which he said would double the annual attendance and revenue of the movie industry.

- MoviePass is detailing how the subscription movie service hopes to return in 2022, and there's a whole lot of Web3 talk, virtual currency, and even ads that track attention to make sure you're not gaming the system. Its assets were reacquired by founding CEO Stacy Spikes – who was fired as MoviePass struggled prior to its eventual bankruptcy – and the company is focusing on a summer relaunch.


MoviePass 2.0 certainly won't be shy of tapping into some of the latest buzzwords as it reboots. "Through dynamic ticket pricing and centralized smart advertising, MoviePass is creating an end-to-end cinematic marketplace that will allow theaters to respond and innovate to movie-goer passions and demands, resulting in the future of cinema," the company says, somewhat opaquely.

- Exactly what that means, Spikes said at an event live-streamed today, is an attempt to deliver more access to theaters but without getting into the unsustainable model that forced it to pull the plug the first time around. Though MoviePass went through multiple iterations, the core strategy was the same: users would pay a monthly subscription, which would allow them to see a certain number of movies each month. At one point, during the service's biggest hype periods in 2016 and 2017, that was up to one movie showing each day.


Unsurprisingly, enough people took advantage of the offer that MoviePass couldn't handle the commitment to paying theaters. After multiple changes to what subscribers could and couldn't do – most meeting with ire from users themselves – it announced it would shut down in September 2019.

- Spikes, who was fired midway through MoviePass' troubled first act, reacquired the assets in November 2021. At the time, he promised a more sustainable version of the company, but it's only today that he's detailed how that will operate. Rather than a single, unlimited tier of subscriptions, the new MoviePass will work on credits.

Those credits, and a virtual currency backing them, can effectively be exchanged for movie tickets. Different subscription levels will include different numbers of credits each month; those unused will roll over to the following period. However, Spikes explained, users would be able to trade credits with each other, with those transactions recorded on a new MoviePass 2.0 blockchain.
At the moment, it's unclear just how much those MoviePass 2.0 subscriptions will cost each month. Or, for that matter, how many credits might be required in order to see a movie.

- In addition to paying for credits or swapping them with other MoviePass subscribers, there'll also be a way for advertisers to reward viewers for actively consuming commercials. Dubbed PreShow, the system is effectively a customized pre-roll, which Spikes said could be tied into specific movies. A PreShow for a James Bond movie, for example, might feature fashion from the film, vehicles, or luxury items like jewelry or watches.

Part of the challenge of video advertising, of course, is attention. 70% of video advertising goes unseen, Spikes claimed, admitting that in early tests users would simply start PreShow clips and then ignore them. To get around that, the MoviePass app will use attention tracking – with all data processed on-device, rather than uploaded to the cloud – to make sure people are watching the PreShow clips. If the system believes they've looked away, the video will pause and they'll be prompted to look back again in order to secure the promised credits.

Certainly, given the appeal of MoviePass in its first iteration, there's a demand for people wanting to go to theaters still. Nonetheless, the question remains as to whether MoviePass 2.0 – even with Web3 technologies and fancy eye-tracking – can be financially sustainable in its second attempt. We'll know more closer to the promised relaunch this summer, when all-important pricing for the subscriptions themselves, and details on which theaters will be accessible with those subscriptions, will all be revealed.

- MoviePass just keeps shooting itself in the foot. On Wednesday, the beleaguered movie-ticketing subscription service confirmed that a security breach may have exposed tens of thousands of customers’ records online, where they may have remained unencrypted since early May. That information is alleged to include MoviePass card numbers and personal credit data including names, addresses, and card expiry dates — in other words, the building blocks for fraudulent financial transactions — all thanks to a lapse in password protection on a critical subdomain server.
- “MoviePass recently discovered a security vulnerability that may have exposed customer records. After discovering the vulnerability, we immediately secured our systems to prevent further exposure and to mitigate the potential impact of this system,” chief executive Mitch Lowe said in a statement. “MoviePass takes this incident seriously and is dedicated to protecting our subscribers’ information. We are working diligently to investigate the scope of this incident and its potential impact on our subscribers. Once we gain a full understanding of the incident, we will promptly notify any affected subscribers snd the appropriate regulators or law enforcement.”
- The announcement arrives as the latest self-inflicted calamity for the so-called Netflix of movies, which has remained in financial free fall for the better part of the past 17 months and has seen its goal of disrupting the theatrical-moviegoing business grow ever more remote. Dwindling from a user base of more than 3 million last year, MoviePass reportedly now boasts fewer than 225,000 subscribers.
- Worse still, the company is furthering its already horrible reputation for jerking subscribers around by continuing to play fast and loose with customer data. News of the server breach comes just two weeks after another report that in July 2018, MoviePass resorted to changing users’ passwords without their knowledge to thwart ticket purchases by heavy users after the company temporarily ran out of funds. Citing former MoviePass employees, Business Insider reported that the 2018 insolvency compelled Lowe to make Mission: Impossible — Fallout unavailable on MoviePass and ordered that half of its subscribers be locked out of the system over the Tom Cruise thriller’s opening weekend.
- Rising from obscurity to national prominence in 2017 by basically subsidizing subscribers’ moviegoing habits — a $9.95 monthly subscription allowed for one movie ticket a day, every day — MoviePass coasted by on consumer goodwill for a few months before staggering from disaster to disaster: technological glitches, surprise ticketing blackouts, massive amounts of user fraud. It eventually evolved into what NASDAQ characterized in a stock analysis as a “failed business that burns through cash at an alarming rate.”
- MoviePass revised its original price plan in April 2018, limiting users to just four movies a month — and dropping that number to three films four months later. The decisions triggered mass subscriber outrage and defection. This January, when the majority stakeholder and parent company of MoviePass, the data-analytics firm Helios and Matheson, spun off a new subsidiary called MoviePass Entertainment Holdings, Wall Street and Hollywood finally came around to what naysayers like the AMC theater chain had been complaining about all along: that the business model of MoviePass was fundamentally “unsustainable.”
- Earlier this year, the company was spending an estimated $73 million a month to stay in operation. Helios and Matheson reported a net loss of $329.3 million last year, according to its most recent financial filing. And adding insult to the company’s already considerable injuries, on July 4 MoviePass suspended its service for several weeks to address technical issues and complete a redesign of its mobile app, and it announced its intention to “use this time to recapitalize in order to facilitate a seamless transition and improved subscriber experience once the service continues.”
- But as Helios and Matheson CEO Ted Farnsworth pointed out in an interview with Vulture earlier this year, unscrupulous subscribers who misused and defrauded MoviePass to the tune of tens of millions of dollars posed a much graver threat than cash burn. “They were giving out their passwords and codes, jumping from device to device,” he said. “Multiple people seeing movies off of one MoviePass card. Multiple cards, multiple addresses, multiple emails. We had people scalping tickets. So it was really trying to get a grip on the people that were really abusing the terms and conditions and ruining it for other people.”
- To remedy some of those issues, MoviePass deployed big data with tactical precision: The company verifies that subscribers (as opposed to scalped-ticket purchasers, friends, or loved ones) are the ones whose butts are in theater seats by double-checking the physical location of users’ smartphones via the MoviePass app. “So now, we continue inside the movie theater when that movie’s kicking off to make sure you’re not two miles away having dinner and somebody else is in there with the ticket,” Farnsworth explained.
- Furthermore, he contextualized his company’s awkward-stage contractions in terms of the trajectory of other disruptive start-ups. “When Airbnb and Uber were starting out, they had these system crashes. And no one cared because it wasn’t in the public eye,” he said. “We, unfortunately, were in the public eye nonstop. And people would just feed on it. But you know what? We’re still standing.”

- Movie ticket subscription service MoviePass has exposed tens of thousands of customer card numbers and personal credit cards because a critical server was not protected with a password.
- Mossab Hussein, a security researcher at Dubai-based cybersecurity firm SpiderSilk, found an exposed database on one of the company’s many subdomains. The database was massive, containing 161 million records at the time of writing and growing in real time. Many of the records were normal computer-generated logging messages used to ensure the running of the service — but many also included sensitive user information, such as MoviePass customer card numbers.
- These MoviePass customer cards are like normal debit cards: they’re issued by Mastercard and store a cash balance, which users who sign up to the subscription service can use to pay to watch a catalog of movies. For a monthly subscription fee, MoviePass uses the debit card to load the full cost of the movie, which the customer then uses to pay for the movie at the cinema.
- We reviewed a sample of 1,000 records and removed the duplicates. A little over half contained unique MoviePass debit card numbers. Each customer card record had the MoviePass debit card number and its expiry date, the card’s balance and when it was activated.
- The database had more than 58,000 records containing card data — and was growing by the minute.
- We also found records containing customers’ personal credit card numbers and their expiry date — which included billing information, including names and postal addresses. Among the records we reviewed, we found records with enough information to make fraudulent card purchases.
- Some records, however, contained card numbers that had been masked except for the last four digits.
- The database also contained email address and some password data related to failed login attempts. We found hundreds of records containing users’ email addresses and presumably incorrectly typed passwords — which was logged — in the database. We verified this by attempting to log into the app with an email address and password that didn’t exist but only we knew. Our dummy email address and password appeared in the database almost immediately.
- None of the records in the database were encrypted.
- Hussain contacted MoviePass chief executive Mitch Lowe by email — which TechCrunch has seen — over the weekend but did not hear back. It was only after TechCrunch reached out Tuesday when MoviePass took the database offline.
- The database was exposed for months. Yonathan Klijnsma, threat researcher at cyberthreat intelligence firm RiskIQ, found evidence that the database was open from early May. Then, after we published this story, security researcher Nitish Shah told TechCrunch he also found the exposed database months earlier. “I even notified them, but they [didn’t bother] to reply or fix it,” he said. He provided a screenshot of the exposed database for proof, which we verified.
- We asked MoviePass several questions — including why the initial email disclosing the security lapse was ignored, for how long the server was exposed and its plans to disclose the incident to customers and state regulators.
- Almost a day after we published, MoviePass acknowledged the security incident in a boilerplate statement but did not answer our questions.
- “MoviePass recently discovered a security vulnerability that may have exposed customer records. After discovering the vulnerability, we immediately secured our systems to prevent further exposure and to mitigate the potential impact of this incident,” said Lowe. “MoviePass takes this incident seriously and is dedicated to protecting our customers’ information. We are working diligently to investigate the scope of this incident and its potential impact on our customers. Once we gain a full understanding of the incident, we will promptly notify any affected subscribers and the appropriate regulators or law enforcement.”
- MoviePass has been on a roller coaster since it hit mainstream audiences last year. The company quickly grew its customer base from 1.5 million to 2 million customers in less than a month. But MoviePass took a tumble after critics said it grew too fast, forcing the company to cease operating briefly after the company ran out of money. The company later said it was profitable, but then suspended service, supposedly to work on its mobile app. It now says it has “restored [service] to a substantial number of our current subscribers.”
- Leaked internal data from April said its customer numbers went from three million subscribers to about 225,000. And just this month MoviePass reportedly changed user passwords to hobble access for customers who use the service extensively.
- Hussein said the company was negligent in leaving data unencrypted in an exposed, accessible database.
- “We keep on seeing companies of all sizes using dangerous methods to maintain and process private user data,” Hussein told TechCrunch. “In the case of MoviePass, we are questioning the reason why would internal technical teams ever be allowed to see such critical data in plaintext — let alone the fact that the data set was exposed for public access by anyone,” he said.
- The security researcher said he found the exposed database using his company-built web mapping tools, which peeks into non-password protected databases that are connected to the internet, and identifies the owner. The information is privately disclosed to companies, often in exchange for a bug bounty.
- Hussein has a history of finding exposed databases. In recent months he found one of Samsung’s development labs exposed on the internet. He also found an exposed backend database belonging to Blind, an anonymity-driven workplace social network, exposing private user data.
- Updated with additional information about a second security researcher. Also updated with new data from RiskIQ that shows the database was exposed as early as May, and not June as we had earlier reported, and a statement from MoviePass.
