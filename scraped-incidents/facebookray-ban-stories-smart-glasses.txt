- Facebook and Ray-Ban's new Stories smart glasses let users capture, share and store photos and videos.
- Stories are touted as having been 'designed for privacy'. However, as a number of high-profile journalists, commentators, privacy advocates point out, Facebook Stories are primarily designed with the privacy of their users in mind rather than the people in their sights.
- Photos and videos of everyone in their sights can can easily and quickly be used, manipulated or otherwise abused, for multiple purposes, including impersonation, fraud, and reputational attacks.

- Update on March 17, 2022 at 9:00AM PT:
- We’re excited to announce that we’re rolling out Ray-Ban Stories, our first-ever smart glasses, launched last year in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, in four new countries. Starting at €329, Ray-Ban Stories will be available online and in select retail stores in Spain, Austria, and Belgium beginning March 17, and in France beginning April 14. These stylish glasses offer everyday wearability and help you be more present with friends, family, and the world around you by letting you capture a moment or listen to music, while your phone stays in your pocket.
- In early April, we’ll introduce four new color combinations in all our markets, giving people more options to choose from, including Round Shiny Black with Gray Transitions® , Round Shiny Black with Brown Transitions®, Wayfarer Matte Black with Gray Transitions® and Wayfarer Shiny Black with Brown Transitions®. These new additions to our collection offer seamless all-day wear with lenses that intelligently filter light for optimum vision in all environments – inside and outside, day to night, up a mountain or in front of the TV. That means that all told, Ray-Ban Stories will be available in 28 different variations. If you can’t decide which style to choose, you can visit Ray Ban’s Instagram Shop now to virtually try them on through a special Spark AR effect and see how each style looks on you.
- 
- 
- We’re also expanding the product’s software features:
- In April, we’ll roll out a marketing campaign in our EU markets to educate people on wearable devices and smart glasses and how they work. The campaign will aim to raise awareness about what signals people should look for when the glasses are in use, and that you should stop recording if anyone around you indicates that they don’t want to be in a photo or video. The campaign will also alert people to being mindful of taking photos around minors.

- Today, we’re excited to launch Ray-Ban Stories: smart glasses that give you a new way to capture photos and video, share your adventures and listen to music or take phone calls — so you can stay present with friends, family and the world around you. Built in partnership with Facebook and EssilorLuxottica, Ray-Ban Stories start at $299 USD and will be available for purchase in 20 style combinations online and in select retail stores in the US, as well as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy and the UK.
- Ray-Ban Stories’ dual integrated 5MP cameras let you capture life’s moments as they happen from a unique first-person perspective. You can easily record the world as you see it, taking photos and up to 30-second videos using the capture button or hands-free with Facebook Assistant voice commands. A hard-wired capture LED lights up to let people nearby know when you’re taking a photo or video. Streamlined, open-ear speakers are built in, and Ray-Ban Stories’ three-microphone audio array delivers richer voice and sound transmission for calls and videos. Beamforming technology and a background noise suppression algorithm provide for an enhanced calling experience like you’d expect from dedicated headphones.
- Ray-Ban Stories pairs with the new Facebook View app, so you can share your stories and memories seamlessly with friends and social media followers. The Facebook View app on iOS and Android makes it easy to import, edit and share content captured on the smart glasses to apps on your phone: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Twitter, TikTok, Snapchat and more. You can also save content to your phone’s camera roll and edit and share from there. And new, exclusive post-capture enhancements built into Facebook View let you create unique content to put a special spin on your posts.
- 
- From the start, we designed Ray-Ban Stories with privacy in mind, adding numerous built-in features to provide control and peace of mind to both device owners and bystanders. More information on these features, as well as our new guidelines for responsible use, can be found on the Ray-Ban Stories privacy microsite.
- Ray-Ban Stories are available in 20 variations, in classic Ray-Ban styles — Wayfarer, Wayfarer Large, Round and Meteor — and five colors with a range of lenses including clear, sun, transition and prescription, so you can choose the style that’s right for you.
- Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses are the first product to come out of our multi-year partnership with EssilorLuxottica. Together, we’re committed to delivering innovative technology and fashion-forward style — while helping people better connect with friends and family. Learn more about Ray-Ban Stories.

- With Ray-Ban Stories you can instantly capture any moment, so your privacy and the privacy of those around you is more important than ever.
- Facebook View is a standalone app that lets you import photos and videos from your glasses and create unique content—all while giving you control over what you choose to share and when.
- We won't access your media without your consent, and we do not use the content of photos and videos captured with Ray-Ban Stories and stored in Facebook View for personalized ads. If you share your media to any other app, that app’s terms apply.
- Meta collects data required to make sure your glasses and app are working properly. We also ask for information to offer you better, more personalized products. But you decide whether you want to share that additional data—info like the number of images you capture, time spent taking videos, or the average length of videos.
- In addition to encrypting your photos and videos, we have expert teams dedicated to preventing hackers from accessing your Facebook account. We also offer tools to help you secure your account, like two-factor authentication and login alerts.
- The Capture LED light lets people know when you’re taking a photo or video so you won’t catch anyone near you off guard.
- Here are some tips to help you and those around you feel safe and comfortable while you’re wearing your glasses.
- Not everyone loves a photo op. Stop recording if anyone expresses that they would rather not be in a photo or video and be mindful of taking photos around minors.
- Turn off your glasses in certain spaces like the doctor’s office, locker room, public bathroom, schools or place of worship.
- Let that capture LED light shine.
- Show others how the capture LED works so they know when you're recording. Tampering with this light is against our terms of service.
- Obey the law. Don’t use your glasses to engage in harmful activities like harassment, infringing on privacy rights, or capturing sensitive information like pin codes.
- Don’t capture images or video when you’re driving and stay focused while operating heavy machinery.
- Be respectful of people nearby. Use a voice command or clear gesture to let them know you’re about to capture.

- To build the metaverse, Facebook needs us to get used to smart glasses.
- Last week Facebook released its new $299 “Ray-Ban Stories” glasses. Wearers can use them to record and share images and short videos, listen to music, and take calls. The people who buy these glasses will soon be out in public and private spaces, photographing and recording the rest of us, and using Facebook’s new “View” app to sort and upload that content.
- My issue with these glasses is partially what they are, but mostly what they will become, and how that will change our social landscape.
- How will we feel going about our lives in public, knowing that at any moment the people around us might be wearing stealth surveillance technology? People have recorded others in public for decades, but it’s gotten more difficult for the average person to detect, and Facebook’s new glasses will make it harder still, since they resemble and carry the Ray-Ban brand.
- That brand’s trusted legacy of “cool” could make Facebook’s glasses appeal to many more people than Snap Spectacles and other camera glasses. (Facebook also has roughly 2 billion more users than Snapchat.) And Facebook can take advantage of the global supply chain and retail outlet infrastructure of Luxottica, Ray-Ban’s parent company. This means the product won’t have to roll out slowly—even worldwide.
- Facebook’s glasses could become especially popular during these pandemic times, for they offer a way to record images and sounds without needing to touch a phone or any other surface. They may also be a hit with parents who need to pay attention to their kids but still want to capture spontaneous moments.
- At first glance, recording with Facebook’s glasses may not seem much different from snapping a photo or video with a smartphone. However, the way the glasses cover the wearer’s eyes and create photos and videos from that person’s viewpoint changes what such activity means for social groups.
- In An Ugly Truth, reporters Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang reveal Facebook's fundamental flaws through a detailed account of its years between two US elections.
- With this product, Facebook is claiming the face as real estate for its own technology. The glasses will become a perpetual viewfinder, emphasizing each wearer’s perspective over the experience of being in any group. As a result, people wearing them may be more drawn to capturing scenes from their unique point of view than actually participating. Also, since more than one person at a time might be wearing the glasses in any given group, this effect could be magnified, and social cohesion could be further fragmented.
- Earlier this year, I wrote an ethics paper with Catherine Flick of De Montfort University in the UK, which was published in the May 2021 Journal of Responsible Technology. We argued that the unbridled deployment of “smart glasses” raises serious unforeseen questions about the future of public social interaction.
- Ray-Ban Stories are a step toward Mark Zuckerberg’s long-term vision for Facebook, which is to realize and participate in the “metaverse.” Venture capitalist Matthew Ball describes the metaverse as a space of “unprecedented interoperability” with a seamless, integrated economy. Zuckerberg explained it as a shared space that unifies many companies and mediated experiences, including real, virtual, and augmented worlds.
- Zuckerberg calls Ray-Ban Stories “one milestone on the path” to immersive augmented-reality (AR) glasses. In 2020, Facebook announced Project Aria, which uses AR-enabled glasses to map the terrain of the public and some private spaces. This mapping effort intends to build up geolocation information and intellectual property to feed the data needs of future AR glasses wearers—and likely advance Facebook’s contribution to the metaverse. As Zuckerberg mentioned in a video introducing Ray-Ban Stories, he plans to ultimately replace mobile phones with Facebook smart glasses.
- Glasses provide different social cues than smartphones. We can tell who is on a phone because we can see the phone in people’s hands. Figuring out who is wearing Facebook’s glasses will be more challenging. In part, the Google Glass experiment failed because Glass looked different from normal eyewear, and we could easily identify and avoid those wearing it. But Ray-Ban Stories look a lot like normal Ray-Bans.
- With Ray-Ban Stories, we can’t always know who is recording, when or where they are doing it, or what will happen to the data they collect. A small light indicates that the glasses are recording, but that isn’t visible from far away. There’s a quiet “shutter” sound when the person wearing the glasses takes a photo, but it’s hard for others to hear. Even if they do hear it, not knowing what someone intends to do with a recording could cause anyone who is privacy-conscious to worry.
- Facebook’s View app “promises to be a safe space,” according to one review, but uploading data through the View app to other Facebook apps makes it unclear which privacy policies apply and how content the glasses record could ultimately be used. People using Ray-Ban Stories may also be subjected to additional surveillance. The View app states that a wearer’s voice commands could be recorded and shared with Facebook to “improve and personalize [the wearer’s] experience.” The user must opt out to avoid this.
- When some (but not all) of the people we interact with are cloaked in Ray-Ban Stories, we may not be able to fully cooperate with each other. We may not want to be recorded. Or if we don’t own Facebook’s glasses, or aren’t on Facebook, we may not be able to participate in social activities in the same way as those with Ray-Ban Stories.
- To date, Facebook hasn’t had a portable consumer hardware device in the market that works with a mobile phone and back-end software, and it’s clear the company is new at this. It lists only five “responsibility” rules for people who purchase the glasses. Believing that people will actually comply with these rules is either naïve or very optimistic.
- These glasses are Facebook’s first step toward building a complete hardware ecosystem for the company’s coming attempts at creating the metaverse. With Ray-Ban Stories, it has gained new capabilities to collect data about people’s behavior, location, and content—even if the company doesn’t use that information yet—as it works toward loftier goals.
- While Facebook conducts an enormous beta test in our public spaces, concerned people will be even more on guard in public and may even take evasive measures, such as wearing hats or glasses, or turning away from anyone wearing Ray-Bans. If Facebook adds facial recognition to these glasses in the future, as the company is reportedly considering, people will have to find new countermeasures. This robs us of our peace.
- Ray-Ban Stories are now for sale in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Italy, and Australia. How people use and respond to the device will vary wildly across countries that have different social norms, values, laws, and expectations of privacy. Facebook may be one of the first companies to attempt to deploy smart camera glasses, but it will not be the last. Many other versions will follow, and we’ll need to look out not just for Ray-Bans, but for all types of devices recording us in more subtle ways.
- Now go out and get yourself some big black frames,With the glass so dark they won't even know your name,And the choice is up to you cause they come in two classes,Rhinestone shades or cheap sunglasses.

- Ray-Ban Stories can take photos and videos with a touch of a button and send them to your phone.
- BuzzFeed News Reporter
- Facebook has just released Ray-Ban Stories, sunglasses with tiny cameras that take video and photos.
- The first thing you'll notice about Facebook’s new camera glasses is that they are not called Facebook Glasses — they are called Ray-Ban Stories. This is because they are made in partnership with Ray-Ban (a cool company that no one hates), and Facebook has had a rough couple of years in the public eye. And “Stories” because, you know, Instagram stories and Facebook stories and also Snapchat "story," lol.
- If the idea of camera sunglasses seems familiar, perhaps that’s because it sounds like Snapchat Spectacles, which launched in 2016. In what I can only imagine is a loving tribute, Facebook has named its camera sunglasses “Stories” after the other signature product that Facebook/Instagram lifted from Snapchat.
- For clarity's sake, I will herein refer to Ray-Ban Stories as “Facebook glasses,” because that’s exactly what I know you are thinking when you read this. The words “Facebook” and “glasses” are making the hair on the back of your neck stand up, right? The phrase “secret spy camera glasses” is making your heart race. And when you hear, “and it’s made by FACEBOOK!”, you emit a blood-curdling scream. Knowing that Facebook is discussing building facial recognition into these things curdles the stomach.
- I know.
- The Wayfarer style and round of Ray-Ban Stories. They are also available in three frame styles, as well as different colors, including clear.
- The second thing to make clear is that these glasses do NOT stream to Facebook or post directly to your Facebook or Instagram. They take photos and short videos and send those to a special app on your phone (iOS or Android) that connects to the glasses over Bluetooth.
- From that app, called View, you can see all the videos and images, and from there, you can do whatever you want with them — download to your phone’s camera roll, upload to Facebook, and send over text or anywhere else through your phone’s standard image-sharing options.
- A video taken with the Ray-Ban Stories (the brown blurry stuff is my hair falling across the lens).
- A few brief notes on how the glasses actually work: The photos and videos actually look really good considering they’re taken from, well, glasses. They have a 5-megapixel camera, along with some onboard processing wizardry that does a lot to sharpen and clean up the images. In my experience, the glasses shot decent images in lower light, and image stabilization was solid enough to prevent video from looking too shaky. Videos only last 30 seconds, but there are some basic tools in the View app to string multiple videos together into montages.
- There are speakers in the arms of the glasses; they’re activated by touch, easy to use, and a surprisingly great feature. I went for a stroll listening to an audiobook (the sound quality is perfectly fine for this use), and it was oddly nice to not hassle with AirPods. Because it’s not an in-ear speaker, you can hear some outside noise — I find this actually great for walking around when you do want to be slightly aware of your surroundings, and it’s probably also great for biking.
- The glasses charge in their case, which is slightly bigger than a normal sunglasses case but not by that much. They can last for about 6 hours of moderate use before needing to be recharged. I’m fastidious about putting my sunglasses back in their case when I take them off so I don’t break them, so I kept them well charged up.
- As far as the weight and comfort of the glasses, they’re only barely heavier than a traditional pair of Wayfarers. I found them to be comfortable, and honestly more so than a few pairs of my regular sunglasses.
- The camera took a pretty nice photo of some flowers. It looks good!
- But, look, I know what you’re thinking: Who cares about the audio quality when literally Facebook is making camera glasses, we are doomed. What you care about is privacy, I know.
- TL;DR: The privacy features for the glasses wearer are decent; privacy features for the rest of the world? Not so much. The implications for our souls? Hopelessly unclear.
- The View app requires a Facebook account to log in, but the content doesn’t directly connect to your account. The video and photos are stored locally on your phone, not sent into Facebook’s servers or the cloud. Basically, if you don’t choose to post those photos to Facebook, Facebook can’t see them or have anything to do with them, which is probably what you want. Well, if you buy Facebook glasses, I don’t really know what you want.
- But this obscures a bigger problem. Your data and images may be safe from the prying eyes of Mark Zuckerberg, sure, but the real danger here isn’t to your data — it’s the fact that you’re walking around wearing barely perceptible spy glasses, taking videos and photos of anyone you want, likely without them noticing.
- There’s a difference between technology that is merely “creepy” versus something that causes actual harm, and conflating the two is an easy mistake (consider the reaction to the Facebook Portal, a creepy thing, but not harmful). But the potential for real-world harm with these glasses seems obvious and clear. Photographing people without their knowledge is usually merely creepy, but a vengeful ex or jealous partner using this technology to threaten, blackmail, or embarrass someone is harmful. And that second scenario seems likely to play out in real life.
- Facebook has anticipated some of these criticisms by not including its name on the product and making sure your content is handled privately. But by removing itself as the chief privacy babadook, it’s turned you — the user — into a strolling privacy violation.
- The sleek Wayfarer frame design means that unlike Google Glass or the flashy bright yellow Snapchat Spectacles, these look very much like regular sunglasses. The two small black camera lenses in the corners of the frames largely blend in unless you’re looking up close, maybe face to face with the person wearing them. In a crowd, it’s unlikely people would notice that these are anything other than regular sunnies. Which is the whole point of the Ray-Ban collaboration! To make them look like normal, cool sunglasses!
- To make it clear to bystanders that you’re taking a video with your camera glasses, there’s a small white LED light in the frame corner that lights up whenever the camera is on. However, the tiny light is far less obvious than Snapchat’s version, which had a larger swirling light ring while filming.
- Although you can’t turn off the light on the glasses or through the app, I was able to do this the old fashion way: I put a tiny piece of masking tape over the LED light and colored the tape black with a Sharpie. It covered it up perfectly.
- Sometimes to stop the creeps, you have to become...a creep.
- Alex Himel, VP of AR at Facebook Reality Labs, informed me over a Zoom chat that taping over the LED light was a violation of the terms of service of the glasses, which prohibit tampering with the device. Be warned.
- Himel told BuzzFeed News that the LED light was a feature they ADDED after consulting with a handful of privacy groups. The Future of Privacy Forum, which is partially funded by Facebook, was one of those groups, and its legal counsel, Jeremy Greenberg, suggested adding some sort of light as a visual cue. He also suggested some sort of second cue (like touching the frames or using the voice assistant) because he anticipated that someone could disable the light.
- But, Greenberg said, there is a real privacy risk to bystanders, and there hasn’t been a product exactly like this before. “These glasses look and feel like typical glasses,” Greenberg told BuzzFeed News. “They look like a cool pair of Ray-Bans, which is definitely a design choice.”
- Remember when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said "the future is private"? LOL.
- Camera glasses aren’t new. In addition to Google Glass and Spectacles, you can buy a pair of fake glasses with a hidden camera for about $50 on Amazon. Someone really motivated to do some sort of sneaky surveillance already has an easy (and much cheaper) way to do this. Facebook isn’t inventing the wheel here — they’re just adding a sleeker chassis and leather interior.
- Mark Zuckerberg recently posted a memo about his ambitions for a metaverse — a digital experience fully immersed in augmented reality and virtual reality. He enthused that this was the future of both social experience and Facebook. Last month, Facebook announced its first step into the metaverse: a way to do work meetings in VR, where you and your coworkers are in avatar form in a conference room.
- Ray-Ban Stories in their current form aren’t exactly metaverse-y; there’s no Minority Report AR/VR component. But it seems likely that Facebook views these glasses as a way to test the market on smart glasses, both to see how people react and to warm up customers to the idea of having people walk around wearing camera glasses.
- So, who exactly are Facebook glasses for? I’m not sure exactly, to be honest. They were a fun gadget, but I’m not sure I’d feel comfortable wearing them every day in public. I wore them to walk my son to school and pulled them up onto my head when I got near the school so that no one would notice that my glasses have cameras.
- These glasses may be best for parents. Himel described how he likes to use them to capture moments of his young children. Any parent knows that little kids stop doing the cute thing they were just doing as soon as you pull out your phone and start filming. And there is no limit to the number of photos and videos parents want to take of their own kids, even just boring things, never to be shared. They’re also hilarious to let a child use. My 5-year-old wore them running around a family Rosh Hashanah dinner, and the footage was like a charmingly demented version of the restaurant scene in Goodfellas. (Facebook pointed out that the terms of service for this device state that it is for ages 13 and up).
- Should you buy a pair? Are they good for me?
- Sure, I guess. They’re pretty fun and cool gadgets. I can nearly guarantee you’d have fun playing around with them.
- But that isn’t really the issue. It’s not whether or not they’re good for you, it’s whether it’s good for the rest of us with a handful of people walking around with $300 camera glasses. The bad guy here isn’t just Facebook. It’s the creeps, stalkers, and other baddies walking around taking your photo as you walk down the street picking your nose or accidentally showing your butt crack. Is that the world you want to live in?
- Correction: Amazon's Echo Frame smart glasses do not have a camera function. A previous version of this post incorrectly said they did.

- Hard nope
- For a mere $299 you can creep out people around you and record them without their consent.
- Ray-Ban Stories, the iconic eyewear company’s “smart glasses” collaboration with Facebook that absolutely no one except Mark Zuckerberg asked for and which will almost assuredly fail as pathetically as Google Glass, is now available. The glorified privacy violation aid can be purchased through Ray-Ban’s official site starting at $299 for nonprescription glasses, and up to around $615 — yes, you read that correctly — for a pair including progressive lenses.
- RB Stories feature a pair of 5-megapixel cameras that can shoot video or stills, and the glasses can store around 30 videos or 500 photos (or a mixture of the two), small speakers built into the stems, and voice controls. There’s also a little LED light that lights up to let anyone around you know when the cameras are in use, although these have already been shown to be easily concealed with no effect on the Ray-Ban Stories’ actual performance.
- This will end well for everyone involved, we’re sure of it.
- Some privacy protections are built-in — In an attempt to mitigate security anxieties, Stories’ cameras rely on a standalone, Bluetooth-reliant app called View which stores any photos or videos taken with the glasses. These files can only be manually uploaded to Facebook and its umbrella apps like Instagram (or rival services, for that matter), there’s no live-streaming option, and they otherwise stay off cloud servers and directly on your phone. Of course, you’ll also need a Facebook account for all this to actually work, but that was inevitable.
- A glorified Spy Magazine toy — It’s hard to see Ray-Ban Stories as much more than a shiny, 21st-century version of those ridiculous X-ray glasses available for purchase in those old Spy Magazine issues. Early reviews say the cameras take pretty good photos and videos... but so does that smartphone in your pocket, and you won’t be weirding out everyone around you by using it.
- There is no real reason for Stories’ existence other than being a novelty, and to call them “smartglasses” is a stretch by any means. In all likelihood, Facebook’s new toy will go the way of the infamous Google Glass, relegated to a tech joke we can all laugh at down the road... at least, we hope so. The alternative — a bunch of people wandering the streets recording us whether we like it or not — happens enough thanks to the government. We don’t need randos at the park also getting in on the action.

- The Ray-Ban Stories are a fusion of Bose Frames and Snap Spectacles, with a big question mark for what comes after this first-gen attempt.
- Facebook's Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses: the most normal-looking yet.
- Facebook's Ray-Ban Stories sunglasses feel almost normal at times. And, of course, utterly abnormal. And also very familiar. I've used products like this, off and on, for years. Welcome to Facebook's first smart glasses.
- After promising smart glasses for years, Facebook's first glasses are disappointingly familiar. These aren't AR glasses at all. They don't have displays in them. Instead, they're a blend of technologies that have already been in other glasses: they have cameras in them, and microphones, and speakers. They're headphones and camera-glasses in one, and that's about it. That's what I expected based on Mark Zuckerberg's recent expectation-setting comments this year, but I'm still surprised these don't push the envelope a bit more.
- The partnership with the massive glasses manufacturer EssilorLuxottica, and the design, are the interesting parts. Ray-Ban Stories is an odd name for the $299 (£299, AU$449) glasses, which are available now at Ray-Ban stores and will be arriving at retailers such as LensCrafters next week. But the glasses don't mention Facebook in the branding very much. Also, they're a clear attempt to take the torch from Snapchat's similarly featured camera-enabled Spectacles, as well as audio-enabled glasses such as the Bose Frames and Amazon Echo Frames. Really, they're a fusion of the two ideas. And at the moment, they're not much more than that, even if Facebook promises to go much further in future products.
- But first, Facebook is going to have to bridge the territory of privacy -- not just for those who might have photos taken of them, but for the wearers of these microphone and camera-equipped glasses. VR headsets are one thing (and they come off your face after a session). Glasses you wear around every day are the start of Facebook's much larger ambition to be an always-connected maker of wearables, and that's a lot harder for most people to get comfortable with.
- A sleek design, and a familiar one.
- Walking down my quiet suburban street, I'm looking up at the sky. Recording the sky. Around my ears, I hear ABBA's new song, I Still Have Faith In You. It's a melancholic end to the summer. I'm taking my new Ray Ban smart glasses for a walk.
- The Ray-Ban Stories feel like a conservative start. They lack some features that have been in similar products already. The glasses, which act as earbud-free headphones, don't have 3D spatial audio like the Bose Frames and Apple's AirPods Pro do. The stereo cameras, on either side of the lenses, don't work with AR effects, either. Facebook has a few sort-of-AR tricks in a brand-new companion app called View that pairs with these glasses on your phone, but they're mostly ways of using depth data for a few quick social effects.
- And yes, these glasses need your phone. They're basically phone peripherals. I tested the Ray-Ban Stories paired with an iPhone 12 Pro. And while my Ray-Ban glasses have sunglass lenses, they can be outfitted with polarized and prescription lenses. These could be my everyday glasses. But right now, my review units didn't come prescription-equipped, so I used contacts when I wore them around. Here's what my first week with them has been like.
- My old Ray-Bans, and the Ray-Ban Stories glasses. Can you see the difference?
- The glasses, which come in several different designs and lens colors, are impressive because they seem so nearly normal, even more so than the Amazon and Bose versions. The Ray-Ban Stories look innocuous at first, but they're still not everyday normal -- the arms are thick, and the charging case they come in is particularly shaped just for these glasses. And there are camera lenses in the corners of the frames. At a distance, they seem invisible. But up close, the lenses are clearly there. Staring.
- That light goes on when it's recording, right near one of the camera lenses in the corners.
- The Ray-Bans I tried were the Wayfarers model, but there are two other models to choose from: Round and Meteor. These glossy black Ray-Bans totally look like my years-old, falling-apart Ray-Ban sunglasses, even up close. They feel less like tech, and more like glasses. There are several colors (shiny black, black matte, shiny blue, shiny olive and shiny brown), and six lenses (G-15 green, photochromatic G-15 green, dark gray, polar dark blue, brown gradient and clear). There are polarized and transition options, and they should be compatible with standard prescriptions, too.
- In a lot of ways, the normal look of these glasses feels like their greatest achievement. I had friends and family who were surprised that these were smart glasses, even when they were standing next to me up close.
- There's a light inside the glasses, too, for battery status and as a recording indicator.
- Unfolding the glasses and putting them on, I hear a little chime sound. They're connected. If I say, "Hey Facebook," a little gentle chirp sounds near my ears letting me know it's listening. Also, there's an LED light that appears in the upper corner of my peripheral vision of my right eye that I can just barely see. The glasses don't talk to me when I say, "Hey, Facebook." They just make little approving beeps or confused beeps to indicate understanding. It sounds a bit like Wall-E.
- Facebook's glasses pair via Bluetooth using the new Facebook View app, like a smartwatch. When on my face they default as Bluetooth audio for my phone. The glasses' right arm is a touch surface, so I can tap, double-tap and triple-tap to accept or end calls, play and pause, and skip tracks. Swiping back and forth increases and lowers volume.
- There's a physical camera button on the top of the right arm, so I can tap once to start a video recording, or press and hold to snap a photo. But there's a delay between the press and the photo snap, while video recording is nearly instantaneous.
- Saying, "Hey Facebook" only enables two features: taking a photo and taking a video. I can't request music, place a call, change volume or do anything else Assistant- or Alexa-like. That's clearly by design. I'm not sure how much I'd trust Facebook with voice commands on the go. But I'd also like more than two commands.
- Facebook records voice commands by default in a log in the app, which can be deleted. These voice commands are analyzed by Facebook, but there's a setting to opt out of storing transcripts (and the voice assistant can be disabled, too). Facebook says these recordings help improve the AI, much like Alexa and Assistant and other voice products do. It doesn't record logs of anything else I say (at least I don't think so).
- A shutter button is on one arm, right above a touchpad that controls volume and can be tapped to answer calls and play/pause.
- The Ray-Ban Stories work like Bluetooth headphones, pumping music to my ears from nearby speaker-holes in a similar way that the Oculus Quest 2 does with speakers in its headband. This means I can wear them easily, and take my mask on and off without popping out earbuds when I'm going to stores, but the audio levels and quality aren't nearly as good as headphones. Or even Bose Frames, which sound richer and louder. They're good enough for casual podcast listening or some music, or taking a phone call. The embedded microphones seemed to work well for call quality as far as other people's experience, from what my mom and a friend told me. The glasses have three beam-forming microphones, which worked pretty well for outdoor calls. But sometimes nearby sounds like lawn mowers ended up getting in the way.
- Technically, you could hear what I'm listening to or who I was talking to if you got close enough to my ears, or if I was standing in a quiet place. It's similar to how the Oculus Quest pipes in sound that can still be heard faintly from a distance.
- I'm surprised these glasses lack 3D spatial audio, a technology that's heated up lately. Facebook is bullish on spatial audio as a way to bring people together virtually, but that element is missing on these glasses right now.
- Ray-Ban Stories self-portrait, bathroom mirror.
- As cameras, these glasses are suitable in a pinch, but they're no phone replacement. The 5-megapixel cameras were never designed to rival phone cameras, and some photos seemed less rich and detailed than I'm used to. But some park shots looked good, and much like the recent Apple Watch wristband camera I tried out this summer, having some ability to snap a pic in phone-free situations is better than none. Familiar memories of memory-surrogate camera devices, including Google Glass, reemerged. But these glasses don't have displays in them -- you have to look forward and just hope you've framed things right. Generally, things turned out kind of OK.
- Recording a photo of myself as I shoot b-roll for my video.
- Video, recorded in 30-second bursts, looks better than expected... but watch my video review and the clips and judge for yourself. Again, this is no GoPro, and the 30-second recording limit means these will never be real camera tools for serious hands-free sports, cooking, art or other possible uses.
- The camera shoots videos in square format at 1,184x1,184 pixels at 30 frames per second (or vertical portrait mode in a long rectangle), and photos in a normal 4:3 ratio, at 2,592x1,944 resolution. No circular videos like Snapchat Spectacles took (thankfully).
- Shot on Ray-Ban Stories: a nearby park. One of the better photos.
- The glasses have onboard storage that's enough for 35 30-second videos or 500 photos, according to Facebook. I never filled it up in one of my outings, but I also kept my phone nearby. The glasses connect back to the phone app, Facebook View, to dump off photos and clear up the glasses storage. These are meant to be used with a phone nearby, but they could be stand-alone camera-glasses for a few hours, too. The glasses recharge using the included case, using a clever magnetic contact hidden in one of the glasses' arm hinges. But that also means you need the case to use the glasses.
- The included charge case, the only way to charge up the glasses.
- The case has a USB-C port to recharge and holds enough battery to charge the glasses several times (three according to Facebook). Battery life for the glasses and the case appear in the View app on the phone. The case half-charges the glasses in 30 minutes, or takes 70 minutes for a full charge.
- They're also Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled; the glasses use Bluetooth 5 to connect to phones for audio and have 802.11ac Wi-Fi to download photos and video faster.
- I feel kind of self-conscious taking photos with these on.
- Welcome (back) to the ongoing question of smart glasses and public acceptance. Ever since the rise and fall of Google Glassholes in 2013/14, we never really solved the idea of how to handle camera-equipped face wearables. Facebook has lots of privacy guidelines in its Ray-Ban Stories reviewer's guide and on the Facebook View app's onboarding tutorial, mainly suggesting to respect local laws, not to use while driving or using heavy equipment, and to turn off when in certain public places. There's an on-off switch inside the glasses along one arm, but the glasses usually don't do anything automatically unless you specifically ask Facebook to take a photo or video, or use the camera shutter button.
- A white LED light built into the front corner of the frames pops on to alert people when you're recording (also, there's a shutter-snap sound when taking photos), but these alerts are pretty subtle. In fact, my kids standing next to me in bright daylight didn't really notice it. That, combined with the unexpectedly subtle darkened camera lenses on the glasses, make these a lot more stealthy than I was expecting. Great for being able to wear them without standing out, and most people aren't likely to think there are cameras built in.
- Then again, we're already in a world where our phones take photos all the time. Life is already a state of semisurveillance. But that doesn't mean that camera glasses are an acceptable social norm, either.
- The Facebook View app, where the glasses pair with your phone and photos and videos are stored. There are some applied after-effects, too.
- But what about concerns about Facebook's privacy intrusions for you, the glasses-wearer? Facebook's new View app promises to be a safe space where photos are collected and not shared to other apps, or uploaded or analyzed by Facebook for ad targeting. Upload to Facebook or Instagram, however, and then you're in Facebook's standard social media privacy rules. Facebook also says all camera usage data isn't used for ad-targeting either (or what the glasses see or hear), but there are settings where you could allow Facebook to analyze how you use the glasses (number of photos taken, length of use), using this to "improve and personalize your product experience." I kept that turned off.
- Does all this feel concerning? Sure. Facebook's bound to keep blurring the lines between privacy and your data as the hardware gets more complex, and so are other manufacturers of AR devices.
- The Ray-Ban Stories next to the Oculus Quest 2. When will these two begin to dovetail?
- As a connected pair of sunglasses, these Ray-Ban Stories show that getting normal glasses to have tech inside really is possible. But these are absolutely not AR glasses, and Facebook's ambitious road ahead includes a lot more than speakers and cameras. Facebook is currently testing sensor arrays in prototype glasses to see how future devices could see and map the world: This is what Facebook wants its future AR headsets to be. Also, at some point, neural input wristbands and watches will act as ways to gesture and touch invisible things shown through heads-up displays.
- Where Facebook goes next with glasses is the interesting part. The multiyear partnership with EssilorLuxottica that Facebook has announced, which starts with these more basic glasses, clearly strives towards far more advanced stuff. Blending of virtual and real with embedded displays, spatial audio. None of that is here, though.
- For the moment, the most interesting part of the Ray-Ban Stories is that they're Ray-Bans. And there is something futuristic about putting these on and suddenly hearing them chirp to life, at the ready, seemingly alive. But their smart features are limited for now. Maybe that comforts you or disappoints you. Or both. But Facebook's true AR visions are going to take a while longer. If you're really interested in mixed reality for a few hundred dollars, the Oculus Quest 2 is already dabbling in it. These Ray-Bans may eventually evolve to meet the Quest someday, too.

- Do we really need sunglasses that can take photos, capture video and play music?
- If you answered, “hell yes,” Facebook just launched a new product that would get a thumbs up from James Bond. But before we get going, please indulge me as I bore you with a tale from summer vacation.
- My wife and I don’t feel comfortable with air travel just yet – the stupid anti-vaxxers really are holding up any return to normal – but we did want the kids to get away for a little R&R before the return of school on Thursday.
- So we booked a few nights last month at Hockley Valley and then Niagara. It was lovely, even if there now appears to be a labour shortage pandemic in the service sector. James Bond would never wait 20 minutes for a martini on any empty patio.
- Anyway, one morning, before we decided to “Journey Behind the Falls,” we took in the rushing aquatic wonder at ground level. Everyone behind the rails was taking photos, including one gorgeous woman who was wearing next to nothing. I mention this only because, as she sauntered along with her muscled boyfriend who also appeared to have a clothing allergy, I noticed some of the cameras in the hands of young men slyly went from shooting the water to shooting the passing hottie.
- It was creepy. This poor thing was just taking in the sights without realizing she had become one. It’s like she was strutting along an invisible red carpet as random strangers suddenly morphed into paparazzi, filming her string bikini from behind.
- I was thinking about this woman after learning about Facebook’s new “smart glasses.” In collaboration with one of the greatest eyewear brands in the world, Ray-Ban Stories are now available in Canada. Starting at $369, and coming in 20 style combinations, Ray-Ban Stories look like normal Ray-Bans but feature dual 5-megapixel cameras, three microphones, speakers embedded in the arms and “beamforming” technology.
- This is Facebook for your face. And given the social behemoth’s track record when it comes to privacy, I would feel safer in exploding underpants.
- I read a bunch of reviews on Friday and watched a couple of promo videos to grasp the target demo. It appears to be anyone, everyone and no one in particular. In one video, a woman wearing Ray-Ban Stories does backflips on a beach and then stands on her hands to snap an upside-down, sunglasses shot of jellyfish kites. Gosh, how relatable. If the goal is to telegraph everyday usefulness, this does not seem like persuasive marketing: Hey, guys, I just bought Ray-Ban Stories in case I’m ever shot out of a cannon against my will on a sunny day and want to document the scattering starlings as my cheeks flap in the wind and I’m too terrified to pull out my phone before impact.
- We are already a society gone selfie mad. We don’t need our sunglasses taking more photos, especially when we already have phones with superior lenses and resolution. Or maybe that’s exactly what Facebook is hoping to disrupt, two eyes at a time.
- In one video, Facebook’s chief android, Mark Zuckerberg, let the long-term strategy slip: “Ray-Ban Stories are an important step toward a future when phones are no longer a central part of our lives.”
- Thanks, but no thanks. I don’t want to sound like a neo-Luddite, but enough is enough with all this “smart” tech. Why is my LG dryer sending me texts to say a cycle is done? Why is my Apple Watch giving my wrist a haptic tap to say it’s time to stand when I’m behind the wheel and doing 100 clicks on the QEW en route to Niagara?
- I can’t stand while I’m driving a car, you idiot watch. Just tell me the time and knock it off with the health tips before you get my family killed.
- It is telling that Facebook has not put its logo on these new glasses. Facebook knows most people believe it is to privacy as The Gap is to haute couture. The company does not want potential consumers to entertain the possibility their eye data will be sold to a third party, or that hackers may see them squinting down at the urinal.
- What’s next? Is Amazon’s Whole Foods going to create a line of AI tongue sensors that make Cheetos taste like caviar? Is IBM going to launch a cochlear implant that sonically converts your partner’s bellyaching into Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5? That’s not hyperbole – it’s the philosophical blueprint of all “smart glasses,” a product with huge R&D budgets, AI end dreams, but still few good reasons to buy.
- It’s bad enough that every second person in public is now disconnected from reality with headphones and a smart phone. Imagine if Ray-Ban Stories become The Next Big Thing. Then the person at the bistro table next to you will be blasting Doja Cat through her eyeballs as she surreptitiously films you stuffing your face with calamari.
- That’s not progress – it’s a dystopian nightmare.
- If those weirdos in Niagara Falls were bold enough to raise their phones to take spontaneous photos of a passing hottie, imagine the encrypted footage they will compile when their sunglasses can double as spyware.
- Technology keeps pushing public behaviour into an obnoxious red zone.
- You don’t need 20/20 vision to see how Ray-Ban Stories will continue this trend.

URL: https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/facebook-warned-over-very-small-indicator-led-on-smart-glasses-as-eu-dpas-flag-privacy-concerns/
- Facebook’s lead privacy regulator in Europe has raised concerns about a pair of “smart” Ray-Ban sunglasses the tech giant is now selling. The glasses include a face-mounted camera that can be used to take pictures and short videos with a verbal cue.
- Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) said Friday that it has asked the tech giant to demonstrate that an LED indicator light also mounted on the specs — which lights up when the user is taking a video — is an effective way of putting other people on notice that they are being recorded by the wearer.
- Italy’s privacy watchdog, the Garante, already raised concerns about Facebook’s smart glasses — but Ireland has an outsized role as a regulator for the tech giant owing to where the company’s regional base is located.
- Facebook debuts its Ray-Ban Stories smart sunglasses
- 
- Facebook announced what it couched as the “next step” on the road to making a pair of augmented reality “smart” glasses a full year ago — saying initial specs would not include any AR but announcing a multiyear partnership with luxury eyewear giant Luxottica, as it seemingly planned for a pipeline of increasingly feature-loaded “smart” eyewear.
- The first Facebook Ray-Ban-branded specs went on sale earlier this month — looking mostly like a standard pair of sunglasses but containing two 5 MP cameras mounted on the front that enable the user to take video of whatever they’re looking at and upload it to a new Facebook app called View. (The sunglasses also contain in-frame speakers so the user can listen to music and take phone calls.)
- The specs also include a front-mounted LED light which is supposed to switch on to indicate when a video is being recorded. However European regulators are concerned that what the DPC describes as a “very small” indicator is an inadequate mechanism for alerting people to the risk they are being recorded.
- Facebook has not demonstrated it conducted comprehensive field testing of the device with a view to assessing the privacy risk it may pose, it added.
- “While it is accepted that many devices including smart phones can record third party individuals, it is generally the case that the camera or the phone is visible as the device by which recording is happening, thereby putting those captured in the recordings on notice. With the glasses, there is a very small indicator light that comes on when recording is occurring. It has not been demonstrated to the DPC and Garante that comprehensive testing in the field was done by Facebook or Ray-Ban to ensure the indicator LED light is an effective means of giving notice,” the DPC wrote.
- Facebook’s lead EU data protection regulator goes on to say it is calling on the tech giant to “confirm and demonstrate that the LED indicator light is effective for its purpose and to run an information campaign to alert the public as to how this new consumer product may give rise to less obvious recording of their images”.
- Facebook was contacted with questions.
- A Facebook spokesperson told us: “We know people have questions about new technologies and how they work and it’s important to us that we are part of this conversation. We will be working together with our regulatory partners, including the Irish DPC as our lead regulator, to help people understand more about how this new technology works, and the controls they have.”
- The company also claimed that it engaged with the DPC ahead of the launch of the specs and said it continues to do so. It also pointed out that the glasses include an off switch.
- The Irish regulator confirmed it was briefed by Facebook regarding the glasses’ compliance with data protection ahead of the launch but Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said it was not consulted on product features.
- “We were briefed and provided with details on compliance with data protection requirements during the summer but not consulted on the development of the product (design and feature[s] had already been done when they came to us),” he said.
- “We shared the info with other DPAs and ourselves and the Garante in particular raised concerns with Facebook — to do with the operation and field testing of the glasses.”
- The specs went on sale earlier this month — costing $299 in the U.S. Facebook confirmed they are also currently on sale in Ireland and Italy in the EU and in the U.K.
- Over the years, Facebook has delayed (or even halted) some of its product launches in Europe following regulatory concerns — including a facial tagging feature (which it later reintroduced in another form).
- The launch of Facebook’s dating service in Europe was also delayed for more than nine months — and arrived with some claimed changes after an intervention by the DPC.
- There are also ongoing limits on how the Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp can share data with Facebook itself in Europe, again owing to regulatory push back. Although plenty of data does still flow from WhatsApp to Facebook in the EU and — zooming out — scores of privacy complaints against the tech giant remain under investigation in the region, meaning these issues are undecided and unenforced.
- Earlier this month Ireland’s DPC did announce its first decision against a Facebook company (under the EU’s GDPR) — hitting WhatsApp with a $267 penalty related to transparency failures. However the DPC has multiple unresolved complaints against Facebook or Facebook-owned businesses still on its desk.
- In January the Irish regulator also agreed to “swiftly” resolve a (pre-GDPR) 2013 complaint against Facebook’s data transfers out of the EU to the U.S. That decision is still pending too.
- This report was updated with comment from Facebook and the DPC.
