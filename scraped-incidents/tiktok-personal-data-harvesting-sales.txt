- TikTok, and its Chinese counterpart Douyin[3] (Chinese: 抖音; pinyin: Dǒuyīn), is a short-form video hosting service owned by ByteDance.[4] It hosts user-submitted videos, which can range in duration from 3 seconds to 10 minutes.[5]
- Since their launches, TikTok and Douyin have gained global popularity.[6][7] In October 2020, TikTok surpassed 2 billion mobile downloads worldwide.[8][9][10] Morning Consult named TikTok the third-fastest growing brand of 2020, after Zoom and Peacock.[11] Cloudflare ranked TikTok the most popular website of 2021, surpassing google.com.[12]
- Douyin was launched by ByteDance in Beijing, China in September 2016, originally under the name A.me, before rebranding to Douyin (抖音) in December 2016.[13][14] Douyin was developed in 200 days and within a year had 100 million users, with more than one billion videos viewed every day.[15][16]
- Douyin was released in the Chinese market in September 2016.[17] TikTok is an entirely separate,[3] internationalized version of Douyin, and was launched in 2017 for iOS and Android in most markets outside of mainland China; however, it became available worldwide only after merging with another Chinese social media service, Musical.ly, on 2 August 2018.
- TikTok and Douyin have almost the same user interface but no access to each other's content.[3] Their servers are each based in the market where the respective app is available.[18] The two products are similar, but their features are not identical. Douyin includes an in-video search feature that can search by people's faces for more videos of them, along with other features such as buying, booking hotels, and making geo-tagged reviews.[19]
- ByteDance planned on Douyin expanding overseas. The founder of ByteDance, Zhang Yiming, stated that "China is home to only one-fifth of Internet users globally. If we don't expand on a global scale, we are bound to lose to peers eyeing the four-fifths. So, going global is a must."[20]
- The app was launched as TikTok in the international market in September 2017.[21] On 23 January 2018, the TikTok app ranked first among free application downloads on app stores in Thailand and other countries.[22]
- TikTok has been downloaded more than 130 million times in the United States and has reached 2 billion downloads worldwide,[23][24] according to data from mobile research firm Sensor Tower (those numbers exclude Android users in China).[25]
- In the United States, celebrities, including Jimmy Fallon and Tony Hawk, began using the app in 2018.[26][27] Other celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Alba, Will Smith, and Justin Bieber joined TikTok as well as many others.[28]
- In January 2019, TikTok allowed creators to embed merchandise sale links into their videos.[29]
- On 3 September 2019, TikTok and the U.S. National Football League (NFL) announced a multi-year partnership.[30] The agreement occurred just two days before the NFL's 100th season kick-off at Soldier Field, where TikTok hosted activities for fans in honor of the deal. The partnership entails the launch of an official NFL TikTok account, which is to bring about new marketing opportunities such as sponsored videos and hashtag challenges. In July 2020, TikTok, excluding Douyin, reported close to 800 million monthly active users worldwide after less than four years of existence.[31]
- In May 2021, TikTok appointed Shou Zi Chew as their new CEO[32] who assumed the position from interim CEO Vanessa Pappas, following the resignation of Kevin A. Mayer on 27 August 2020.[33][34][35] On 3 August 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok in the United States on 15 September if negotiations for the company to be bought by Microsoft or a different American company failed.[36] On 6 August, Trump signed two executive orders banning U.S. "transactions" with TikTok and WeChat to its respective parent companies ByteDance and Tencent, set to take effect 45 days after the signing.[37] A planned ban of the app on 20 September 2020[38][39] was postponed by a week and then blocked by a federal judge.[40][41][42][43] President Biden revoked the ban in a new executive order in June 2021.[44] The app has been banned by the government of India since June 2020 along with 223 other Chinese apps in view of privacy concerns.[45] Pakistan banned TikTok citing "immoral" and "indecent" videos on 9 October 2020 but reversed its ban ten days later.[46][47][48] In March 2021, a Pakistani court ordered a new TikTok ban due to complaints over "indecent" content.
- In September 2021, TikTok reported that it had reached 1 billion users.[49] In 2021, TikTok earned $4 billion in advertising revenue.[50]
- In October 2022, TikTok was reported to be planning an expansion into the e-commerce market in the US, following the launch of TikTok Shop in the United Kingdom. The company posted job listings for staff for a series of order fulfillment centers in the US and is reportedly planning to start the new live shopping business before the end of the year.[51]
- According to data from app analytics group Sensor Tower, advertising on TikTok in the US grew by 11% in March 2023, with companies including Pepsi, DoorDash, Amazon and Apple among the top spenders. According to estimates from research group Insider Intelligence, TikTok is projected to generate $14.15 billion in revenue in 2023, up from $9.89 billion in 2022.[52]
- On 9 November 2017, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, spent nearly $1 billion to purchase musical.ly, a startup headquartered in Shanghai with an overseas office in Santa Monica, California, U.S.[53][54] Musical.ly was a social media video platform that allowed users to create short lip-sync and comedy videos, initially released in August 2014. TikTok merged with musical.ly on 2 August 2018 with existing accounts and data consolidated into one app, keeping the title TikTok.[55] This ended musical.ly and made TikTok a worldwide app, excluding China, since China already had Douyin.[54][56][57]
- As of 2018, TikTok was available in more than 150 markets, and in 75 languages.[58][unreliable source?] TikTok was downloaded more than 104 million times on Apple's App Store during the first half of 2018, according to data provided to CNBC by Sensor Tower.[59]
- After merging with musical.ly in August, downloads increased and TikTok became the most downloaded app in the U.S. in October 2018, which musical.ly had done once before.[60][61] In February 2019, TikTok, together with Douyin, hit one billion downloads globally, excluding Android installs in China.[62] In 2019, media outlets cited TikTok as the 7th-most-downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.[63] It was also the most-downloaded app on Apple's App Store in 2018 and 2019, surpassing Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.[64][65] In September 2020, a deal was confirmed between ByteDance and Oracle in which the latter will serve as a partner to provide cloud hosting.[66][67] Walmart intends to invest in TikTok.[68] This deal would stall in 2021 as newly elected President Biden's Justice Department put a hold on the previous U.S. ban under President Trump.[69][70][71] In November 2020, TikTok signed a licensing deal with Sony Music.[72] In December 2020, Warner Music Group signed a licensing deal with TikTok.[73][74][75] In April 2021, Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism partnered with TikTok to promote tourism.[76] It came following the January 2021 winter campaign, initiated through a partnership between the UAE Government Media Office partnered and TikTok to promote the country's tourism.[77]
- Since 2014, the first non-gaming apps[78] with more than 3 billion downloads were Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger; all owned by Meta. TikTok was the first non-Facebook app to reach that figure. Sensor Tower reported that although TikTok had been banned in India, its largest market, in June 2020, downloads in the rest of the world continue to increase, reaching 3 billion downloads in 2021.[79]
- The advertising revenue of short video clips is lower than other social media: while users spend more time, American audience is monetized at a rate of $0.31 per hour, a third the rate of Facebook and a fifth the rate of Instagram, $67 per year while Instagram will make more than $200.[80]
- The mobile app allows users to create short videos, which often feature music in the background and can be sped up, slowed down, or edited with a filter.[81] They can also add their own sound on top of the background music. To create a music video with the app, users can choose background music from a wide variety of music genres, edit with a filter and record a 15-second video with speed adjustments before uploading it to share with others on TikTok or other social platforms.[82]
- The "For You" page on TikTok is a feed of videos that are recommended to users based on their activity on the app. Content is curated by TikTok's artificial intelligence depending on the content a user liked, interacted with, or searched. This is in contrast to other social networks' algorithms basing such content off of the user's relationships with other users and what they liked or interacted with.[83]
- The app's "react" feature allows users to film their reaction to a specific video, over which it is placed in a small window that is movable around the screen.[84] Its "duet" feature allows users to film a video aside from another video.[85] The "duet" feature was another trademark of musical.ly. The duet feature is also only able to be used if both parties adjust the privacy settings.[86]
- Videos that users do not want to post yet can be stored in their "drafts". The user is allowed to see their "drafts" and post when they find it fitting.[87]
The app allows users to set their accounts as "private". When first downloading the app, the user's account is public by default. The user can change to private in their settings. Private content remains visible to TikTok but is blocked from TikTok users who the account holder has not authorized to view their content.[88] Users can choose whether any other user, or only their "friends", may interact with them through the app via comments, messages, or "react" or "duet" videos.[84] Users also can set specific videos to either "public", "friends only", or "private" regardless if the account is private or not.[88]
- Users can also send their friends videos, emojis, and messages with direct messaging. TikTok has also included a feature to create a video based on the user's comments. Influencers often use the "live" feature. This feature is only available for those who have at least 1,000 followers and are over 16 years old. If over 18, the user's followers can send virtual "gifts" that can be later exchanged for money.[89][90]
- TikTok announced a "family safety mode" in February 2020 for parents to be able to control their children's presence on the app. There is a screen time management option, restricted mode, and the option to put a limit on direct messages.[91][92] The app expanded its parental controls feature called "Family Pairing" in September 2020 to provide parents and guardians with educational resources to understand what children on TikTok are exposed to. Content for the feature was created in partnership with online safety nonprofit, Internet Matters.[93]
- In October 2021, TikTok launched a test feature that allows users to directly tip certain creators. Accounts of users that are of age, have at least 100,000 followers and agree to the terms can activate a "Tip" button on their profile, which allows followers to tip any amount, starting from $1.[94]
- In December 2021, TikTok started beta-testing Live Studio, a streaming software that would let users broadcast applications open on their computers, including games. The software also launched with support for mobile and PC streaming.[95] However, a few days later, users on Twitter discovered that the software uses code from the open-source OBS Studio. OBS made a statement saying that, under the GNU GPL version 2, TikTok has to make the code of Live Studio publicly available if it wants to use any code from OBS.[96]
- In May 2022, TikTok announced TikTok Pulse, an ad revenue-sharing program. It covers the "top 4% of all videos on TikTok" and is only available to creators with more than 100,000 followers. If an eligible creator's video reaches the top 4%, they will receive a 50% share of the revenue from ads displayed with the video.[97]
- TikTok tends to appeal to younger users, as 41% of its users are between the ages of 16 and 24. These individuals are considered Generation Z.[83] Among these TikTok users, 90% said they used the app daily.[98] TikTok's geographical use has shown that 43% of new users are from India.[99] As of the first quarter of 2022, there were over 100 million monthly active users in the United States and 23 million in the UK. The average user, daily, was spending 1 hour and 25 minutes on the app and opening TikTok 17 times.[100]
- A variety of trends have risen within TikTok, including memes, lip-synced songs, and comedy videos. Duets, a feature that allows users to add their own video to an existing video with the original content's audio, have sparked many of these trends.
- The app has spawned numerous viral trends, Internet celebrities, and music trends around the world.[101] Many stars got their start on musical.ly, which merged with TikTok on 2 August 2018. These include Loren Gray, Baby Ariel, Kristen Hancher, Zach King, Lisa and Lena, Jacob Sartorius, and many others. Loren Gray remained the most-followed individual on TikTok until Charli D'Amelio surpassed her on 25 March 2020. Gray's was the first TikTok account to reach 40 million followers on the platform. She was surpassed with 41.3 million followers. D'Amelio was the first to ever reach 50, 60, and 70 million followers. Charli D'Amelio remained the most-followed individual on the platform until she was surpassed by Khaby Lame on June 23, 2022. Other creators rose to fame after the platform merged with musical.ly on 2 August 2018.[102] TikTok also played a major part in making "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X one of the biggest songs of 2019 and the longest-running number-one song in the history of the US Billboard Hot 100.[103][104][105]
- TikTok has allowed many music artists to gain a wider audience, often including foreign fans. For example, despite never having toured in Asia, the band Fitz and the Tantrums developed a large following in South Korea following the widespread popularity of their 2016 song "HandClap" on the platform.[106] "Any Song" by R&B and rap artist Zico became number one on the Korean music charts due to the popularity of the #anysongchallenge, where users dance to the choreography of the song.[107] The platform has also launched many songs that failed to garner initial commercial success into sleeper hits, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.[108][109] However, it has received criticism for not paying royalties to artists whose music is used on the platform.[110]
- In June 2020, TikTok users and K-pop fans "claimed to have registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets" for President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa through communication on TikTok,[111] contributing to "rows of empty seats"[112] at the event. Later, in October 2020, an organization called TikTok for Biden was created to support then-presidential candidate Joe Biden.[113] After the election, the organization was renamed to Gen-Z for Change.[114][115]
- TikTok has banned Holocaust denial, but other conspiracy theories have become popular on the platform, such as Pizzagate and QAnon (two conspiracy theories popular among the U.S. alt-right) whose hashtags reached almost 80 million views and 50 million views respectively by June 2020.[116] The platform has also been used to spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, such as clips from Plandemic.[116] TikTok removed some of these videos and has generally added links to accurate COVID-19 information on videos with tags related to the pandemic.[117]
- On 10 August 2020, Emily Jacobssen wrote and sang "Ode to Remy", a song praising the protagonist from Pixar's 2007 computer-animated film Ratatouille. The song rose to popularity when musician Daniel Mertzlufft composed a backing track to the song. In response, began creating a "crowdsourced" project called Ratatouille the Musical. Since Mertzlufft's video, many new elements including costume design, additional songs, and a playbill have been created.[118] On 1 January 2021, a full one-hour virtual presentation of Ratatouille the Musical premiered on TodayTix. It starred Titus Burgess as Remy, Wayne Brady as Django, Adam Lambert as Emile, Kevin Chamberlin as Gusteau, Andrew Barth Feldman as Linguini, Ashley Park as Colette, Priscilla Lopez as Mabel, Mary Testa as Skinner, and André De Shields as Ego.
- On Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, some celebrities who had garnered large followings as of August 2019 include Dilraba Dilmurat, Angelababy, Luo Zhixiang, Ouyang Nana, and Pan Changjiang.[119] In the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a Qatari teenage royal became an internet celebrity after his angry expressions were recorded in Qatar's opening match loss to Ecuador;[120] he amassed more than 15 million followers in less than a week after creating a Douyin account.[121]
- Content promoting cosmetic surgery is popular on TikTok and has spawned several viral trends on the platform. In December 2021, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, published an article about the popularity of some plastic surgeons on TikTok. In the article, it was noted that plastic surgeons were some of the earliest adopters of social media in the medical field and many had been recognised as influencers on the platform. The article published stats about the most popular plastic surgeons on TikTok up to February 2021 and at the time, five different plastic surgeons had surpassed 1 million followers on the platform.[122][123]
- In 2021, it was reported that a trend known as the #NoseJobCheck trend was going viral on TikTok. TikTok content creators used a specific audio on their videos while showing how their noses looked before and after having their rhinoplasty surgeries. By January 2021, the hashtag #nosejob had accumulated 1.6 billion views, #nosejobcheck had accumulated 1 billion views, and the audio used in the #NoseJobCheck trend had been used in 120,000 videos.[124] In 2020, Charli D'Amelio, the most-followed person on TikTok at the time, also made a #NoseJobCheck video to show the results of her surgery to repair her previously broken nose.[125]
- In April 2022, NBC News reported that surgeons were giving influencers on the platform discounted or free cosmetic surgeries in order to advertise the procedures to their audiences. They also reported that facilities that offered these surgeries were also posting about them on TikTok. TikTok has banned the advertising of cosmetic surgeries on the platform but cosmetic surgeons are still able to reach large audiences using unpaid photo and video posts. NBC reported that videos using the hashtags '#plasticsurgery' and '#lipfiller' had amassed a combined 26 billion views on the platform.[126]
- In December 2022, it was reported that a cosmetic surgery procedure known as buccal fat removal was going viral on the platform. The procedure involves surgically removing fat from the cheeks in order to give the face a slimmer and more chiseled appearance. Videos using hashtags related to buccal fat removal had collectively amassed over 180 million views. Some TikTok users criticised the trend for promoting an unobtainable beauty standard.[127][128][129]
- TikTok has provided a platform for users to create content not only for fun but also for money. As the platform has grown significantly over the past few years, it has allowed companies to advertise and rapidly reach their intended demographic through influencer marketing.[130] The platform's AI algorithm also contributes to the influencer marketing potential, as it picks out content according to the user's preference.[131] Sponsored content is not as prevalent on the platform as it is on other social media apps, but brands and influencers still can make as much as they would if not more in comparison to other platforms.[131] Influencers on the platform who earn money through engagement, such as likes and comments, are referred to as "meme machines".[130]
- In 2021, The New York Times reported that viral TikTok videos by young people relating the emotional impact of books on them, tagged with the label "BookTok", significantly drove sales of literature. Publishers were increasingly using the platform as a venue for influencer marketing.[132]
- In 2022, NBC News reported in a television segment that some TikTok and YouTube influencers were being given free and discounted cosmetic surgeries in order for them to advertise the surgeries to users of the platforms.[133]
- In 2022, it was reported that a trend called "de-influencing" had become popular on the platform as a backlash to influencer marketing. TikTok creators participating in this trend made videos criticising products promoted by influencers and asked their audiences not to buy products they did not need. However, some creators participating in the trend started promoting alternative products to their audiences and earning commission from sales made through their affiliate links in the same manner as the influencers they were originally criticising.[134][135]
- In October 2020, the e-commerce platform Shopify added TikTok to its portfolio of social media platforms, allowing online merchants to sell their products directly to consumers on TikTok.[136]
- Some small businesses have used TikTok to advertise and to reach an audience wider than the geographical region they would normally serve. The viral response to many small business TikTok videos has been attributed to TikTok's algorithm, which shows content that viewers at large are drawn to, but which they are unlikely to actively search for (such as videos on unconventional types of businesses, like beekeeping and logging).[137]
- In 2020, digital media companies such as Group Nine Media and Global used TikTok increasingly, focusing on tactics such as brokering partnerships with TikTok influencers and developing branded content campaigns.[138] Notable collaborations between larger brands and top TikTok influencers have included Chipotle's partnership with David Dobrik in May 2019[139] and Dunkin' Donuts' partnership with Charli D'Amelio in September 2020.[140]
- TikTok is regularly used by sex workers to promote pornographic content sold on platforms such as OnlyFans.[141] In 2020, the use of the term "accountant" to refer to adult content creators became widespread after a user posted a viral song on the platform about how it was easier for him to tell people he was an accountant instead of a pornographic actor.[142] In response, TikTok updated their terms of service to ban content that promotes "premium sexual content" and banned a large number of adult content creators, but these creators have used various methods to evade censorship.[143] Methods used by adult content creators to avoid censorship include referring to themselves as accountants, using substitutes for words in their captions and videos  – such as using the corn emoji in place of the word "porn", and "n00ds" instead of "nudes  – and using filters to censor their explicit images.[144][145] Some adult creators have also gone viral for posting videos with unsolvable riddles in them. These riddles attracted large numbers of comments by people trying and failing to solve the riddles, which in turn caused TikTok's recommendation algorithm to recommend them to more people as it perceived them as popular videos.[146]
- Popular TikTok users have lived collectively in collab houses, predominantly in the Los Angeles area.[147]
- As of January 2023[update], TikTok is reportedly banned in several Asian countries including Afghanistan,[148] Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh,[149][150] India,[151][152][153] Iran,[154] Pakistan,[155] and Syria. The app was previously banned temporarily in Indonesia[156] and Jordan,[157] though both have been lifted since.

The network is also reportedly considering a ban on the app.[164]
- On 6 August 2020, then U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order[165][166] which would ban TikTok transactions in 45 days if it was not sold by ByteDance. Trump also signed a similar order against the WeChat application owned by the Chinese multinational company Tencent.[167][39]
- On 14 August 2020, Trump issued another order[168][169] giving ByteDance 90 days to sell or spin off its U.S. TikTok business.[170] In the order, Trump said that there is "credible evidence" that leads him to believe that ByteDance "might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States."[171] Donald Trump was concerned about TikTok being a threat because TikTok's parent company was rumored to be taking United States user data and reporting it back to Chinese operations through the company ByteDance.[172]
- In June 2021, new president Joe Biden signed an executive order revoking the Trump administration ban on TikTok, and instead ordered the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the app to determine if it poses a threat to U.S. national security.[173]
- In June 2022, reports emerged that ByteDance employees in China could access US data and repeatedly accessed the private information of TikTok users,[174][175][176] TikTok employees were cited saying that "everything is seen in China", while one director claimed a Beijing-based engineer referred to as a "Master Admin" has "access to everything".[174][177][178]
- Following the reports, TikTok announced that 100% of its US user traffic is now being routed to Oracle Cloud, along with their intention to delete all US user data from their own data centers.[175][177] This deal stems from the talks with Oracle instigated in September 2020 in the midst of Trump's threat to ban TikTok in the US.[179][180][178]
- In June 2022, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr called for Google and Apple to remove TikTok from their app stores, citing national security concerns, saying TikTok "harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show are being accessed in Beijing."[181][174]
- In October 2022, a Forbes report claimed that the ByteDance team planned to surveil individual American citizens for undisclosed reasons. TikTok denied these claims in a series of tweets, saying that this report lacked "both rigor and journalistic integrity".[182][183]
- In November 2022, Christopher A. Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told U.S. lawmakers that "the Chinese government could use [TikTok] to control data collection on millions of users or control the recommendation algorithm, which could be used for influence operations."[184]
- In December 2022, Senator Marco Rubio and representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced the Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party Act (ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act), which would prohibit Chinese- and Russian-owned social networks from doing business in the United States.[185][186] That month, Senator Josh Hawley also introduced a separate measure, the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, to ban federal employees from using TikTok on all government devices.[187] On December 15, Hawley's measure was unanimously passed by the U.S. Senate.[188] On December 27, the Chief Administrative Officer of the United States House of Representatives banned TikTok from all devices managed by the House of Representatives.[189]
- As of February 2023,[190][191] at least 32 (of 50) states have announced or enacted bans on state government agencies, employees, and contractors using TikTok on government-issued devices. State bans only affect government employees and do not prohibit civilians from having or using the app on their personal devices.
- In March 2023, Politico reported that TikTok hired SKDK to lobby amid a possible federal ban.[192]
- The same month TikTok's CEO appeared before Congress to address the concerns surrounding the app. He stated that TikTok's data collection practices did not differ from those of US social media platforms.[193]
- A ban of TikTok in the United States has been referred to as hypocrisy because of the similar spying of users of US social networks done by the NSA with the PRISM surveillance program.[194]
- Montana became the first state to pass legislation banning TikTok on all personal devices from operating within state lines and barring app stores from offering TikTok for downloads.[195][196][197] State governor Greg Gianforte signed the bill in May 2023 with the law going into effect in January 2024.[195][196][198] A lawsuit was filed against the state shortly after the bill was signed by content creators of the app in Montana.[199][200]
- By 7 March 2023, 68 Australian federal agencies had banned TikTok on work-related mobile devices. Liberal Party Senator James Paterson called for a federal ban on all government-related devices.[201] In April, West Australian Premier Mark McGowan banned TikTok from government phones.[202]
- On 17 March 2023, the New Zealand Parliamentary Service banned TikTok on devices connected to Parliament, citing cybersecurity concerns.[203][204]
- There are concerns that some users may find it hard to stop using TikTok.[205] In April 2018, an addiction-reduction feature was added to Douyin.[205] This encouraged users to take a break every 90 minutes.[205] Later in 2018, the feature was rolled out to the TikTok app. TikTok uses some top influencers such as Gabe Erwin, Alan Chikin Chow, James Henry, and Cosette Rinab to encourage viewers to stop using the app and take a break.[206]
- Many were also concerned with the app affecting users' attention spans due to the short-form nature of the content. This is a concern as many of TikTok's audience are younger children, whose brains are still developing.[207] TikTok executives and representatives have noted and made aware to advertisers on the platform that users have poor attention spans. With a large amount of video content, nearly 50% of users find it stressful to watch a video longer than a minute and a third of users watch videos at double speed.[100] TikTok has also received criticism for enabling children to purchase coins which they can send to other users.[208]
- In June 2022, TikTok introduced the ability to set a maximum uninterrupted screen time allowance, after which the app blocks off the ability to navigate the feed. The block only lifts after the app is exited and left unused for a set period of time. Additionally, the app features a dashboard with statistics on how often the app is opened, how much time is spent browsing it and when the browsing occurs.[209]
- In April 2023, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that TikTok faces multiple lawsuits pertaining to content related to suicide and self-harm.[210]
- Some countries have shown concerns regarding the content on TikTok, as their cultures view it as obscene, immoral, vulgar, and encouraging pornography. There have been temporary blocks and warnings issued by countries including Indonesia,[211] Bangladesh,[212] India,[213] and Pakistan[214][215] over the content concerns. In 2018, Douyin was reprimanded by Chinese media watchdogs for showing "unacceptable" content.[216]
- On 27 July 2020, Egypt sentenced five women to two years in prison over TikTok videos. One of the women had encouraged other women to try and earn money on the platform, another woman was sent to prison for dancing. The court also imposed a fine of 300,000 Egyptian pounds (UK£14,600) on each defendant.[217]
- With reports that Palestinians resorted to TikTok for promoting their cause after platforms like Facebook and Twitter blocked their content,[218] Israeli analyst Yoni Ben-Menachem told Arab News in 2022 that the Chinese app was a "tool of dangerous influence" inciting violence through videos glorifying attacks against Israelis.[219][220] The Palestinian militant group Lion's Den gained much of their popularity through TikTok, according to Ynet.[221] In February 2023, Otzma Yehudit politician Almog Cohen advocated blocking TikTok for all of East Jerusalem.[222]
- Concerns have been voiced regarding content relating to, and the promotion and spreading of hate speech and far-right extremism, such as anti-semitism, racism, and xenophobia. Some videos were shown to expressly promote Holocaust denial and told viewers to take up arms and fight in the name of white supremacy and the swastika.[223] As TikTok has gained popularity among young children,[224] and the popularity of extremist and hateful content is growing, calls for tighter restrictions on their flexible boundaries have been made. TikTok has since released tougher parental controls to filter out inappropriate content and to ensure they can provide sufficient protection and security.[225]
- A viral TikTok trend known as "devious licks" involves students vandalizing or stealing school property and posting videos of the action on the platform. The trend has led to increasing school vandalism and subsequent measures taken by some schools to prevent damage. Some students have been arrested for participating in the trend.[226][227] TikTok has taken measures to remove and prevent access to content displaying the trend.[228]
- The Wall Street Journal has reported that doctors experienced a surge in reported cases of tics, tied to an increasing number of TikTok videos from content creators with Tourette syndrome. Doctors suggested that the cause may be a social one as users who consumed content showcasing various tics would sometimes develop tics of their own.[229]
- In March 2022, the Washington Post reported that Facebook owner Meta Platforms had paid Targeted Victory—a consulting firm backed by supporters of the U.S. Republican Party—to coordinate lobbying and media campaigns against TikTok to portray it as "a danger to American children and society", primarily to stoke anti-Chinese xenophobia and counter criticism of Facebook's own services. This included op-eds and letters to the editor in regional publications, the amplification of "dubious local news stories citing TikTok as the origin of dangerous teen trends" (such as the aforementioned "devious licks", and an alleged "Slap a Teacher" challenge), including those whose initial development actually began on Facebook, and the similar promotion of "proactive coverage" of Facebook corporate initiatives.[230]
- In Malaysia, TikTok is used by some users to engage in hate speech against race and religion especially mentioning the 13 May incident after the 2022 election. TikTok responded by taking down videos with content that violated their community guidelines.[231]
- Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed lawsuits against TikTok, alleging that the platform exposed inappropriate content to minors. The complaint also alleges that TikTok "intentionally falsely reports the frequency of sexual content, nudity, and mature/suggestive themes" on their platform which made the app's "12-plus" age ratings on the Apple and Google app stores deceptive.[232][233]
- TikTok raised the minimum age for livestreaming from 16 to 18 after a BBC News investigation found hundreds of accounts going live from Syrian refugee camps, with children begging for donations through digital gifts, which led to TikTok taking a 70% cut of the donations.[234]
- In March 2023, The Jewish Chronicle reported that TikTok was hosting videos promoting the neo-Nazi propaganda film Europa: The Last Battle, despite having being alerted to the issue four months prior.[235]
- In January 2020, left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America said that TikTok hosted misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic despite a recent policy against misinformation.[236] In April 2020, the government of India asked TikTok to remove users posting misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[237] There were also multiple conspiracy theories that the government is involved with the spread of the pandemic.[238] As a response to this, TikTok launched a feature to report content for misinformation.[239] It reported that in the second half of 2020, over 340,000 videos in the U.S. about election misinformation and 50,000 videos of COVID-19 misinformation were removed.[240]
- To combat misinformation in the 2022 midterm election in the US, TikTok announced a midterms Elections Center available in-app to users in 40 different languages. TikTok partnered with the National Association of Secretaries of State to give accurate local information to users.[241]
- In September 2022, NewsGuard Technologies reported that among the TikTok searches it had conducted and analyzed from the U.S., 19.4% surfaced misinformation such as questionable or harmful content about COVID-19 vaccines, homemade remedies, the 2020 US elections, the war in Ukraine, the Robb Elementary School shooting, and abortion. NewsGuard suggested that in contrast, results from Google were of higher quality.[242] Mashable's own test from Australia found innocuous results after searching for "getting my COVID vaccine" but suggestions such as "climate change is a myth" after typing in "climate change".[240]
- TikTok's censorship policy has been criticized as non-transparent.[243] Criticism of leaders such as Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Mahatma Gandhi[244] and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan[245] has been suppressed by the platform, as well as information relating to the Xinjiang internment camps and the Uyghur genocide.[246][247] Internal documents have revealed that moderators suppress posts created by users deemed "too ugly, poor, or disabled" for the platform, and censor political speech on livestreams.[248][249][250] TikTok moderators have also blocked content that could be perceived as positive towards LGBT people in addition to a set of country-specific censorship rules such as banning mentions of 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in China and Kurdish nationalism in Turkey.[245][251]
- In 2022, in response to criticism, the platform launched a "transparency center" – a virtual hub where researchers can access the platform's moderation tools and content guidelines, including a secret list of keywords used for filtering content.[252]
- TikTok is the 10th most popular app in Russia.[253] After a new set of Russian fake news laws was installed in March 2022, the company announced a series of restrictions on Russian and non-Russian posts and livestreams.[254][255] Tracking Exposed, a user data rights group, learned of what was likely a technical glitch that became exploited by pro-Russia posters. It stated that although this and other loopholes were patched by TikTok before the end of March, the initial failure to correctly implement the restrictions, in addition to the effects from Kremlin's "fake news" laws, contributed to the formation of a "splinternet ... dominated by pro-war content" in Russia.[256][253] TikTok said that it had removed 204 accounts for swaying public opinion about the war while obscuring their origins and that its fact checkers had removed 41,191 videos for violating its misinformation policies.[257][258]
- In October 2019, TikTok removed about two dozen accounts that were responsible for posting ISIL propaganda and execution videos on the app.[259][260]
- Privacy concerns have also been brought up regarding the app.[261][262] In its privacy policy, TikTok lists that it collects usage information, IP addresses, a user's mobile carrier, unique device identifiers, keystroke patterns, and location data, among other data.[263][264] Web developers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk said that allowing videos and other content to be shared by the app's users through HTTP puts the users' data privacy at risk.[265]
- Since the early 2020s, American conservatives have accused the website of spying on its users in cooperation with the Chinese government. These accusations and conspiracy theories were created in part by Republican consulting firms such as Targeted Victory as well as Facebook parent Meta.[266]
- In January 2020, Check Point Research discovered a security flaw in TikTok which could have allowed hackers access to user accounts using SMS.[267] In February, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman criticised the app, calling it "spyware", and stating "I look at that app as so fundamentally parasitic, that it's always listening, the fingerprinting technology they use is truly terrifying, and I could not bring myself to install an app like that on my phone."[268][269] Responding to Huffman's comments, TikTok stated, "These are baseless accusations made without a shred of evidence."[263] Wells Fargo banned the app from its devices due to privacy and security concerns.[270]
In May 2020, the Dutch Data Protection Authority announced an investigation into TikTok in relation to privacy protections for children.[271][272] In June 2020, the European Data Protection Board announced that it would assemble a task force to examine TikTok's user privacy and security practices.[273]
- In August 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok tracked Android user data, including MAC addresses and IMEIs, with a tactic in violation of Google's policies.[274][275] The report sparked calls in the U.S. Senate for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to launch an investigation.[276]
- In June 2021, TikTok updated its privacy policy to include collection of biometric data, including "faceprints and voiceprints".[277] Some experts reacted by calling the terms of collection and data use "vague" and "highly problematic".[278] The same month, CNBC reported that former employees had stated that "the boundaries between TikTok and ByteDance were so blurry as to be almost non-existent" and that "ByteDance employees are able to access U.S. user data" on TikTok.[279]
- In October 2021, following the Facebook Files and controversies about social media ethics, a bipartisan group of lawmakers also pressed TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat on questions of data privacy and moderation for age-appropriate content. The New York Times reported, "Lawmakers also hammered [head of U.S. policy at TikTok] Mr. Beckerman about whether TikTok's Chinese ownership could expose consumer data to Beijing," stating that "Critics have long argued that the company would be obligated to turn Americans' data over to the Chinese government if asked."[280] TikTok told U.S. lawmakers it does not give information to China's government. TikTok's representative stated that TikTok's data is stored in the U.S. with backups in Singapore. According to the company's representative, TikTok had "no affiliation" with the subsidiary Beijing ByteDance Technology, in which the Chinese government has a minority stake and board seat.[281]
- In June 2022, BuzzFeed News reported that leaked audio recordings of internal TikTok meetings revealed that certain China-based employees of the company maintain full access to overseas data.[282][283]
- In August 2022, software engineer and security researcher Felix Krause found that TikTok's in-app browser contained keylogger functionality.[284]
- In September 2022, during testimony to the Senate Homeland Security Committee, TikTok's COO stated that the company could not commit to stopping data transfers from US users to China. The COO reacted to concerns of the company's handling of user data by stating that TikTok does not operate in China, though the company does have an office there.[285]
- Additionally, in November 2022, TikTok's head of privacy for Europe, Elaine Fox, confirmed that some of its workers, including the workers in China, have access to the user info of accounts from the UK and European Union. According to Fox, this "privacy policy" was "based on a demonstrated need to do their job."[286]
- In March 2023, a former employee of the company held multiple meetings with US senators, stating that the company's proposed Project Texas data protections would not prevent Chinese employees of TikTok from "spying" on US users' data. The ex-employee also stated that a complete "re-engineering" of the app would be required to achieve privacy from China.[287]
- According to a 2023 investigation by the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), TikTok was accessible to children younger than 13 years old. This is despite TikTok's stipulation in their Terms of Service that users be 13 or older to create accounts. As a result, 1.4 million UK children under 13 years old managed to access the site in 2020. Moreover, as per ICO investigation, TikTok utilized these children's data without getting consent from their parents. Information Commissioner John Edwards believes that this information could have been used to profile these minors and present them with offensive or inappropriate stuff. In an interview with BBC, Edwards added that TikTok has not made any efforts to collect permission from parents. Because of this breach of children's privacy, this video-sharing platform now faces a penalty of £12.7m. TikTok has 28 days for representation and appeals for a penalty reduction. The regulator's final decision will be issued at most 16 weeks from the date of the issuance of the proposed fine.[288]
- In May 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that former employees complained about TikTok tracking users who had viewed LGBT-related content, leading to fears of collected data potentially usable for blackmail.[289]
- On 27 February 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined ByteDance U.S.$5.7 million for collecting information from minors under the age of 13 in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.[290] ByteDance responded by adding a kids-only mode to TikTok which blocks the upload of videos, the building of user profiles, direct messaging, and commenting on others' videos, while still allowing the viewing and recording of content.[291] In May 2020, an advocacy group filed a complaint with the FTC saying that TikTok had violated the terms of the February 2019 consent decree, which sparked subsequent Congressional calls for a renewed FTC investigation.[292][293][294][295] In July 2020, it was reported that the FTC and the United States Department of Justice had initiated investigations.[296]
- In February 2019, the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office launched an investigation of TikTok following the fine ByteDance received from the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Speaking to a parliamentary committee, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said that the investigation focuses on the issues of private data collection, the kind of videos collected and shared by children online, as well as the platform's open messaging system which allows any adult to message any child. She noted that the company was potentially violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which requires the company to provide different services and different protections for children.[297]
- On 22 January 2021, the Italian Data Protection Authority ordered the blocking of the use of the data of users whose age has not been established on the social network.[298][299] The order was issued after the death of a 10-year-old Sicilian girl, which occurred after the execution of a challenge shared by users of the platform that involved attempting to choke the user with a belt around the neck. The block is set to remain in place until 15 February, when it will be re-evaluated.[300][needs update]
- In September 2021, the Ireland Data Protection Commissioner opened investigations into TikTok concerning the protection of minors' data and transfers of personal data to China.[301][302]
- In February 2022, the incumbent Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton, initiated an investigation into TikTok for alleged violations of children's privacy and facilitation of human trafficking.[303][304] Paxton claimed that the Texas Department of Public Safety gathered several pieces of content showing the attempted recruitment of teenagers to smuggle people or goods across the Mexico–United States border. He claimed the evidence may prove the company's involvement in "human smuggling, sex trafficking and drug trafficking." The company claimed that no illegal activity of any kind is supported on the platform.[305]
- In December 2022, TikTok confirmed that journalists' data was accessed by employees of its parent company. It previously denied using location information to track U.S. users.[306]
- TikTok parent company ByteDance fired four employees who improperly accessed the personal data of two journalists on the platform, a TikTok spokesman ByteDance confirmed to CNN. As ByteDance employees investigated potential employee leaks to the media, they accessed the TikTok user data of two journalists, according to the company. Personal data obtained from journalists' accounts included IP addresses, which can be used to track location.[307] This was apparently done in order to reveal the journalists' sources.[308]
- The incident is reportedly being investigated by the FBI as of March 2023.[309]
- In February 2023, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, along with its counterparts in Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, launched an investigation into TikTok's data collection practices.[310]
- As with other platforms,[311] journalists in several countries have raised privacy concerns about the app because it is popular with children and has the potential to be used by sexual predators.[311][312][313][314]
- Several users have reported endemic cyberbullying on TikTok,[315][316] including racism[317] and ableism.[318][319][320] In December 2019, following a report by German digital rights group Netzpolitik.org, TikTok admitted that it had suppressed videos by disabled users as well as LGBTQ+ users in a purported effort to limit cyberbullying.[321][248] TikTok's moderators were also told to suppress users with "abnormal body shape", "ugly facial looks", "too many wrinkles", or in "slums, rural fields" and "dilapidated housing" to prevent bullying.[322]
- In 2021, the platform revealed that it will be introducing a feature that will prevent teenagers from receiving notifications past their bedtime. The company will no longer send push notifications after 9 PM to users aged between 13 and 15. For 16 to 17 year olds, notifications will not be sent after 10 PM.[323]
- In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that "Mental-health professionals around the country are growing increasingly concerned about the effects on teen girls of posting sexualized TikTok videos."[324] In March 2022, a coalition of U.S. state attorneys general launched an investigation into TikTok's effect on children's mental health.[325]
- In November 2022, Australia's medical regulatory agency, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) reported that there was a global shortage of the diabetes medication Ozempic. Ozempic is a brand of semaglutide used by patients with Type-2 diabetes to regulate blood glucose, with weight loss as side effect. According to the TGA, the rise in demand was caused by an increase in off-label prescription of the drug for weight loss purposes. Off-label prescription is the prescription of a drug for purposes other than what it was approved for.[326] In December 2022, after the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) listed Ozempic as being in shortage in the United States as well, it was reported that huge increase in demand for off-label prescriptions of the medicine was caused by a weight loss trend on TikTok, where videos about the drug had exceeded 360 million views.[327][328][329] Wegovy, a drug with a higher dosage of semaglutide that has been specifically approved for use in treating obesity, also became popular on the platform after Elon Musk credited it for helping him lose weight.[330][331]
- Several former employees of the company have claimed of poor workplace conditions, including the start of the workweek on Sunday to cooperate with Chinese timezones and excessive workload. Employees claimed they averaged 85 hours of meetings per week and would frequently stay up all night in order to complete tasks. Some employees claimed the workplace's schedule operated similarly to the 996 schedule. The company has a stated policy of working from 10 AM to 7 PM five days per week (63 hours per week), but employees noted that it was encouraged for employees to work after hours. One female worker complained that the company did not allow her adequate time to change her feminine hygiene product because of back-to-back meetings. Another employee noted that working at the company caused her to seek marriage therapy and lose an unhealthy amount of weight.[332] In response to the allegations, the company noted that they were committed to allowing employees "support and flexibility".[333][334]
- China censors and regulates the contents that Douyin shows, including to minors in the country. There are also different time restrictions in place according to the user's age. Screen time limits on TikTok are largely voluntary.[335][336]
- In January 2023, Forbes reported that employees use a manual "heating" tool in order to distribute certain videos widely, without disclosing this to users. Based on conversations with unnamed employees and former employees, the magazine said ByteDance did this to inflate the apparent value of the platform for influencers while negotiating deals, and that it has also been abused by some employees to promoted their own accounts or those of their spouses.[308] A documented called the MINT Heating Playbook reportedly says heated videos account for 1-2% of views. The company apparently built the tool in order to diversify the content on the platform compared to what the automatic algorithm was recommending, to keep users more interested.[308]
- TikTok has been criticized for its privacy practices[261] and censoring of content made by LGBTQ+ users as well as content that criticized the Chinese government.[245][246]
- Tencent's WeChat platform has been accused of blocking Douyin's videos.[337][338] In April 2018, Douyin sued Tencent and accused it of spreading false and damaging information on its WeChat platform, demanding CN¥1 million in compensation and an apology. In June 2018, Tencent filed a lawsuit against Toutiao and Douyin in a Beijing court, alleging they had repeatedly defamed Tencent with negative news and damaged its reputation, seeking a nominal sum of CN¥1 in compensation and a public apology.[339] In response, Toutiao filed a complaint the following day against Tencent for allegedly unfair competition and asking for CN¥90 million in economic losses.[340]
- In November 2019, a class action lawsuit was filed in California that alleged that TikTok transferred personally identifiable information of U.S. persons to servers located in China owned by Tencent and Alibaba.[341][342][343] The lawsuit also accused ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, of taking user content without their permission. The plaintiff of the lawsuit, college student Misty Hong, downloaded the app but said she never created an account. She realized a few months later that TikTok has created an account for her using her information (such as biometrics) and made a summary of her information. The lawsuit also alleged that information was sent to Chinese tech giant Baidu.[344] In July 2020, twenty lawsuits against TikTok were merged into a single class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.[345] In February 2021, TikTok agreed to pay $92 million to settle the class action lawsuit.[346]
- In May 2021, Canadian voice actor Bev Standing filed a lawsuit against TikTok over the use of her voice in the text-to-speech feature without her permission. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York. TikTok declined to comment. Standing believes that TikTok used recordings she made for the Chinese government-run Institute of Acoustics.[347] The voice used in the feature was subsequently changed.[348]
- In June 2021, the Netherlands-based Market Information Research Foundation (SOMI) filed a €1.4 billion lawsuit on behalf of Dutch parents against TikTok, alleging that the app gathers data on children without adequate permission.[349]
- Multiple lawsuits have been filed against TikTok, accusing the platform of hosting content that led to the death of at least seven children.[350] The lawsuits claim that children died after attempting the "Blackout challenge", a TikTok trend that involves strangling or asphyxiating someone or themselves until they black out (passing out). TikTok stated that search queries for the challenge do not show any results, linking instead to protective resources, while the parents of two of the deceased argued that the content showed up on their children's TikTok feeds, without them searching for it.[351]

- TikTok on Wednesday agreed to pay $92 million to settle claims stemming from a class-action lawsuit alleging the app illegally tracked and shared the personal data of users without their consent.
- TikTok has agreed to pay $92 million to settle dozens of lawsuits alleging that the popular video-sharing app harvested personal data from users, including information using facial recognition technology, without consent and shared the data with third-parties, some of which were based in China.
- The proposed settlement, which lawyers in the case have called among the largest privacy-related payouts in history, applies to 89 million TikTok users in the U.S. whose personal data was allegedly tracked and sold to advertisers in violation of state and federal law.
- "First, it provides compensation for TikTok users, but equally as important, it ensures TikTok will respect its users' privacy going forward," Katrina Carroll, one of the lawyers for TikTok users, said. "Social media seems so innocuous, but troubling data collection, storage, and disclosure can happen behind the scenes."
- The settlement is the result of 21 federal lawsuits filed mostly on behalf of  minors — some as young as 6 years old — that claimed the company engaged in the "theft of private and personally identifiable TikTok user data."
- A TikTok spokesperson said while the company disagrees with the assertions in the lawsuit, the company decided settling the case was in its best interest.
- "Rather than go through lengthy litigation, we'd like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community," the spokesperson said.
- The legal battle has raged for more than a year. The suits were merged into one multi-district action in the Northern District of Illinois that cited violations of privacy laws in Illinois and California. The laws require technology companies to receive written consent before collecting data about a person's identity. The suit also claimed TikTok broke federal laws, including privacy and computer fraud and abuse statutes.
- According to lawyers representing TikTok users, the app "clandestinely vacuumed up" vast quantities of private and personally identifiable data that could be used to identify and surveil users without permission. Even information from draft videos that were never shared publicly on the app were mined by TikTok for data, the lawyers for the users alleged.
- As millions in the U.S. turned to the app for videos of dance challenges, cooking tips and silly skits, TikTok was allegedly sending their information to servers in China, or in other countries where China-based employees could access the data.
- Tiktok also shared information about users, without their consent, with Facebook, Google and other companies, the suit claims.
- "The TikTok app's lighthearted fun comes at a heavy cost," plaintiffs' lawyers wrote in the lawsuit.
- Investigators hired by the plaintiffs' lawyers found that TikTok went to great lengths to hide the data collection and sharing practices.
- "Plaintiffs' investigation has revealed that [TikTok did so] by obfuscating the source code that would reveal their misconduct," according to the suit.
- The tentative settlement awaits final approval by U.S. District Judge John Lee of the Northern District of Illinois.
- Under the proposed terms of the settlement, TikTok will no longer record a user's biometric information, including facial characteristics, nor track a user's location using GPS data. TikTok also committed to stop sending U.S. users data overseas and the app said it would no longer collect data on draft videos before the content is published.
- Former President Donald Trump clamped down on TikTok over its ties to China. The app is owned by Beijing-based tech company ByteDance. TikTok has long maintained that authorities in China cannot access U.S. user data, which is controlled by an American-led team.
- The Biden administration has pulled back from its predecessor's crackdown on TikTok, instead launching a broader review of Americans' use of Chinese technology.
- That said, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency group led by the Treasury Department that probes companies with overseas connections, is in the midst of a national security review of TikTok that may force changes to the company's corporate structure.
- The proposed TikTok settlement announced on Wednesday follows a similar deal struck last year in which Facebook paid $650 million to resolve legal claims over collecting and storing biometric data of millions of users.
- Federal regulators have scrutinized TikTok's data collection practices of minors. In February 2019, TikTok paid a $5.7 million fine to the Federal Trade Commission over allegations the app illegally collected personal information from children.

- TikTok parent company ByteDance has agreed to a $92 million deal to settle class-action lawsuits alleging that the company illegally collected and used underage TikTok users' personal data.
- The proposed settlement (PDF) would require TikTok to pay out up to $92 million to members of the class and to change some of its data-collection processes and disclosures going forward.
- The suit, which rolled up more than 20 related lawsuits, mostly filed on behalf of minors, alleged that TikTok violated both state and federal privacy laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Video Privacy and Protection Act, through its use of data.
- TikTok uses "automated software, proprietary algorithms, AI, facial recognition, and other technologies to commercially profit from" its users, the complaint (PDF) alleged. The data that TikTok allegedly collects, shares, and uses for machine learning training goes surprisingly deep, the suit added, including users' "identities, unique identifying information, biometric data and information, images, video and digital recordings, audio recordings, clipboard data, geolocation, names, email addresses, passcodes, social media accounts, messaging services, telephone numbers, and other private, nonpublic, or confidential data and information."
- Additionally, the suit cited concerns that private and personally identifiable user data TikTok collected could have been shared with Chinese government entities, echoing the Trump administration's concerns in its failed attempts to ban TikTok from operating in the US.
- TikTok denied any specific wrongdoing. "While we disagree with the assertions, rather than go through lengthy litigation, we’d like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community," the company said in a statement.
- Attorneys representing the plaintiffs touted the settlement as "one of the largest ever achieved" in such a case. Inasmuch as their assertion is true, it comes out as far more damning of the state of US privacy laws than complimentary of this particular case.
- The total class, as defined in the settlement, includes 89 million US users. The attorneys ask for a collective payment "not to exceed 33.33% of the settlement fund," leaving $61 million for the class members to collect. On top of that, however, the proposed deal is structured such that each member of the "national" class can claim a share, and Illinois users can claim six shares.
- TikTok identified 1.4 million users who would qualify in the Illinois subclass, leaving about 87.6 million other class members nationwide. According to the settlement, if every qualified member of the class filed for a claim, most users could expect to reap about $0.96 and Illinois users could get as much as $5.75.
- In the filing, however, attorneys make clear that they do not expect a high percentage of the class to file claims, instead describing likely payouts for hypothetical claims rates from 1.5 percent ($383.33 for Illinois, $63.89 for everyone else) to 20 percent ($28.75 for Illinois, $4.79 for everyone else) of the class.
- Of course, money isn't everything; lawsuits such as this class action often seek injunctive relief as well—that is, requiring the company not to do the bad thing anymore. This agreement is no different. Under the proposed terms, TikTok will implement a "companywide data privacy training initiative" to instruct employees and contractors to comply with data privacy laws.
- As for its collection, storage, and use of sensitive data, TikTok does not actually say in the settlement that it will stop those activities, but it says instead that it will update its privacy policies to make sure those activities are more clearly disclosed "and in compliance with all applicable laws."
- A judge will have to approve the proposed settlement before it goes into effect; the process is expected to take several months.

- TikTok has agreed to pay $92 million to settle dozens of lawsuits, many from minors, alleging it amassed users' personal data without consent and sold it to advertisers, reports NPR.
- The proposed settlement, described as one of the "largest privacy-related payouts in history," includes 89 million US users, some as young as six years old. According to lawyers involved in the suit, TikTok quietly collected a mountain of personally identifiable information on account holders, including biometric data such as their ethnicity, gender, and age. And even information from draft videos that were not shared publicly on the platform.
- In an extensive legal scrap, TikTok initially found itself facing over 20 federal lawsuits, which were later combined into one one multi-district action in the Northern District of Illinois. The suit claimed the company broke federal laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Video Privacy and Protection Act, along with privacy laws in Illinois and California.
- TikTok told NPR that it disagreed with the allegations, but decided on settling the case to avoid protracting an already lengthy litigation battle. "We'd like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community," a company spokesperson said.
- The settlement, which is pending approval by the court, also dictates that TikTok must stop tracking biometric information, including facial characteristics. It has also committed to halt the movement of US user data overseas and promised to cease its collection of data from draft videos.
- “This is one of the largest settlements ever achieved in a consumer BIPA case, and one of the largest privacy class action settlements,” Ekwan Rhow, a co-lead counsel for the lawsuit, said in a statement. “It serves as a reminder to corporations that privacy matters, and they will be held accountable for violating consumers’ rights.”
- The payout is the latest admonishment for the popular video-sharing app. TikTok is grappling with numerous security investigations and consumer law complaints across the pond in Europe and was previously fined $5.7 million by the FTC over child privacy violations.

- TikTok and its parent company, China’s ByteDance, have agreed to a settlement resolving a federal class-action lawsuit claiming the short-form video app wrongfully collected users’ biometric data and shared it with third parties.
- Under the terms of the settlement, TikTok will pay $92 million toward a fund for users who claim their personally identifiable information was improperly used by the app. The agreement also requires that TikTok establish a new privacy-compliance training program and take other steps to protect its users’ privacy going forward.
- If the settlement is approved by the court, affected TikTok users will receive information about how to receive a share of the funds. The multidistrict litigation consolidated 21 cases filed against TikTok, its predecessor Musical.ly, and its affiliates.
- 
- TikTok has denied any privacy violations. “While we disagree with the assertions, rather than go through lengthy litigation, we’d like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement.
- The class-action lawsuit contended that the app collected and disclosed personal data in violation of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), the federal Video Privacy Protection Act, and other consumer and privacy protection laws. According to the suit, among other things TikTok failed to notify users that the app’s filters and effects use facial scans — and that such biometric data was stored and used without their consent for various purposes, including for serving targeted ads.
- TikTok “unjustly profit[ed] from the secret harvesting of this massive array of private and personally identifiable TikTok user data and content by using it for targeted advertising” and other purposes, according to the plaintiffs’ complaint (available at this link).
- The lawsuit also alleged that the TikTok app “clandestinely vacuumed up and transferred to servers in China (and to other servers accessible from within China) vast quantities of private and personally identifiable user data and content that could be employed to identify, profile, and track the physical and digital location and activities of United States users now and in the future.”
- TikTok has repeatedly denied that it shares any user data with Chinese authorities, a concern that led former President Trump to threaten to ban TikTok in the U.S. unless it sold the app to American buyers. The Biden administration has put that order on hold amid a broader cybersecurity review.
- 
- Currently, Illinois is the only U.S. state with a law that lets consumers seek monetary damages if their biometric information is wrongfully taken. As such, the settlement proposes that each Illinois class member receive an additional five shares of the $92 million settlement fund compared with class members in other states.
- The settlement was presented for approval Thursday to U.S. District Court Judge John Z. Lee of the Northern District of Illinois by the three attorneys appointed to lead the case in September 2020: Beth Fegan of FeganScott, Katrina Carroll of Carlson Lynch, and Ekwan Rhow of Bird, Marella, Boxer, Wolpert, Nessim, Drooks, Lincenberg & Rhow.

- TikTok has agreed to pay a proposed $92 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging the company invaded user privacy.
- The settlement, if approved, would lay to rest claims that the video content-sharing app, owned by Beijing-headquartered ByteDance, wrongfully collected the private and biometric data of users including teenagers and minors.
- The class-action lawsuit originated from 21 separate class-action lawsuits filed in California and Illinois last year.
- If accepted, the settlement -- filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois -- would require the creation of a compensation fund for TikTok users. In addition, TikTok would be required to launch a new "privacy compliance" training program and would need to take further measures to protect user data.
- According to the proposed settlement (via NPR), TikTok was accused of using a "complex system of artificial intelligence (AI)" to recognize facial features in user videos, as well as to recommend stickers and filters. Algorithms are also cited as a means to identify a user's age, gender, and ethnicity.
- The lawsuit also alleged that user data was sent to China, and shared with third-parties, without consent.
- TikTok has denied any wrongdoing. However, in a statement, the social media giant said:
- "While we disagree with the assertions, rather than go through lengthy litigation, we'd like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community."
- TikTok announced tighter controls for young users in January, including default privacy settings and restricting Duet and Stitch to users aged 16 and over.
- A judge is required to approve the $92 million settlement. Under the terms of the deal, it is possible that class members in Illinois could receive a larger share as the only US state that has laws in place to allow residents to seek compensation when their biometric data is collected or used without consent through the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).
- "Biometric information is among the most sensitive of private information because it's unique and it's permanent," commented co-lead counsel Beth Fegan. "Users' data follows them everywhere, and potentially for a lifetime. It's critical that their privacy and identity is protected by stalwart governance to guard against underhanded attempts at theft."
- FeganScott and Carlson Lynch LLP are among the legal firms involved in the class-action lawsuit.
- Last year, Facebook agreed to pay $550 million to settle BIPA violation claims in Illinois. Complainants argued that the company's "Tag Suggestions" feature scraped and stored biometric markers without the consent of users.

- TikTok has agreed to fork over $92 million to settle a class-action complaint regarding alleged privacy violations, including claims that the app and its predecessor, Musical.ly, collected personal data without users’ consent for tracking and ad targeting purposes.
- The proposed settlement, which lawyers in the case estimated to be one of the largest privacy-related payouts in the U.S. to date, would include nearly all U.S. TikTok users and follows 21 class-action lawsuits that alleged TikTok engaged in a slew of scummy data harvesting tactics. The suit claims TikTok broke federal cybersecurity and privacy laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Video Privacy and Protection Act, along with several state-mandated consumer protection laws in California.
- It purportedly used facial recognition technology to quietly collect users’ biometric data such as their ethnicity, gender, and age under the guise of a preventative measure to keep minors off the app (The company has already paid out millions in fines and settlements after reports that it illegally collected and sold young users’ data). The suit also claims TikTok collected “highly sensitive personal data” without users’ permission and then sold that data to third-parties.
- TikTok has denied this most recent lawsuit’s allegations and claims it agreed to the settlement to avoid a drawn-out legal battle.
- “While we disagree with the assertions, rather than go through lengthy litigation, we’d like to focus our efforts on building a safe and joyful experience for the TikTok community,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a press statement to multiple outlets.
- Under the settlement’s conditions, TikTok has agreed to remain in compliance with applicable laws and refrain from hoovering up any user data that isn’t explicitly disclosed in its privacy policy. That includes recording user’s biometric information, collecting GPS or clipboard data, and sharing U.S. users’ data overseas.
- The proposed settlement is set to go before U.S. District Judge John Lee of the Northern District of Illinois for final approval, per NPR. TikTok did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment.

- Twenty lawsuits have been combined into a unified federal legal action against short-form video app TikTok over allegedly harvesting data from users and secretly sending the information to China.
- Families are suing TikTok in what has turned into a major legal action in federal court.
- Dozens of minors, through their parents, are alleging that the video-sharing app collects information about their facial characteristics, locations and close contacts, and quietly sends that data to servers in China.
- Twenty separate but similar federal lawsuits were filed over the past year on behalf of TikTok users in California, where the company has offices, and Illinois, which requires that technology companies receive written consent before collecting data on a person's identity.
- The suits now have been merged into one.
- And on Tuesday, a panel of federal judges ruled that the case will be based in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Judge John Z. Lee was appointed as the presiding judge.
- Plaintiffs' lawyers will be asking Lee to expand the suit into a nationwide class action, potentially affecting tens of millions of American users.
- While TikTok flatly denies the allegations, the company is under intense pressure to avoid a long, drawn-out legal battle. The Trump administration considers TikTok a national security threat because its parent company, ByteDance, is based in China. President Trump said Monday that TikTok must be sold to an American suitor by Sept. 15 or "close down" in the United States. Microsoft Corp., for one, has acknowledged it is exploring a bid.
- TikTok is fighting to have the privacy lawsuit dismissed. But if it survives, the suit could cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars.
- A lawsuit filed under the same Illinois law against Facebook over its use of facial recognition technology recently prompted the social network to agree to a record data-privacy settlement of $650 million. Legal experts said, if the court approves the TikTok lawsuit as a national case, the settlement sum could exceed the Facebook payout.
- The Illinois law, known as the Biometric Information Privacy Act, "has been striking fear in the heart of many companies in the United States for fear that claims like this will be brought," said Lesley Weaver, one of the 33 plaintiffs' attorneys involved in the litigation against TikTok.
- Attorneys for TikTok said the app is neither capturing users' biometric information nor sending any data to China. But TikTok's legal team also argues that the company can transfer data to Beijing, if it so chooses, without breaking any laws.
- "The App's privacy policy also fully discloses that user data will be shared with TikTok's corporate affiliates and third-party business partners and service providers, as is standard with free social networking apps that have a business model based on advertising," TikTok lawyer Tony Weibell wrote in a submission to the court.
- Is TikTok sending data to China?
- The national security debate about TikTok centers on something nobody has so far provided direct evidence of: that Tiktok is sending information about American citizens to China and, possibly, the Chinese Community Party.
- TikTok said its primary servers for its U.S. users are in Virginia and its backup servers are in Singapore. The company said no data collected on Americans ever goes to servers or authorities in China.
- But that contradicts the findings of technology experts hired by the plaintiffs' attorneys. Those experts, who studied the collection and journey of TikTok data, claim troves of information are being sent to servers in China "under the control of third-parties who cooperate with the Chinese government," according to the lawsuit.
- "Such information reveals TikTok users' precise physical location, including possibly indoor locations within buildings, and TikTok users' apps that possibly reveal mental or physical health, religious views, political views, and sexual orientation," attorneys for users wrote in legal filings.
- The lawyers declined to comment for this story and would not disclose to NPR who their experts are or what methods they employed.
- In the lawsuit, they contend that as soon as TikTok is downloaded, it starts collecting data, even before a user opens an account. If a user begins making a video but then does not save it, data in the video is still mined by TikTok, according to the suit. Even when TikTok is merely on a phone but not being used, it is still allegedly vacuuming up loads of personal data. It is a practice, the suit argues, that violates the law by not receiving the consent of users.
- The attorneys for the users said the app engages in what they call "covert theft" while attempting to hide its tracks.
- "They do so by obfuscating the source code that would reveal the private and personally-identifiable user data and content actually taken from users' mobile devices," the suit says.
- TikTok denies that any of its data collection starts before users agree to its terms of service. TikTok is upfront about what data it takes from users. Experts said most smartphone apps collect and store just as much — or more — data as TikTok does.
- TikTok's legal team said the lawsuit is based on a "factually mistaken" analysis of how the app collects data and what it is doing with that data. But worse than that, according to TikTok lawyer Weibell, is that the suit is China-phobic in the same way many U.S. politicians and Silicon Valley tech giants are, he argues.
- "The present lawsuit is based on (and quotes) the same anti-Chinese rhetoric, conjecture, supposition, and innuendo that originated with these political and competitive attacks," Weibell said in a filing.
- Weibell declined to comment on the suit to NPR.
- TikTok says case should be tossed based on user agreement
- TikTok's terms of service include what is known as an arbitration clause, which makes users agree that any complaint about the company can never be part of a class-action lawsuit.
- But under California law, arbitration clauses do not apply to minors. They can still file lawsuits if they think they have been harmed.
- Attorneys for the users said because data collection allegedly happens before any terms of service are agreed to, users of any age should be able to have their day in court.
- TikTok, though, hopes the whole case will be thrown out on the grounds that users do not have a right to bring the lawsuit in the first place because of the arbitration clause that forces disputes to be resolved outside court.
- If a panel of judges overseeing the case sides with TikTok, the whole case could fall apart. But if the panel agrees with the plaintiffs, both sides will begin deliberations about who is able to join the class action and how much money will be at stake.
- Under the Illinois biometric law, the minimum penalty is $1,000 per instance that identifying data was taken without someone's consent. If it is proven that the covert theft was reckless, the penalty can go up to $5,000 per violation.
- According to market research firm Sensor Tower, TikTok has been downloaded more than 180 million times in the United States.
- Lawsuit looms over potential sale to Microsoft
- What kind of exposure Microsoft would have to pending litigation will likely be part of the software giant's review ahead of an official offer to buy the app. But lawyers involved in the case said the lawsuit is not likely to dissuade Microsoft, a company valued at $1.5 trillion.
- Some lawyers involved in the lawsuit predicted that a settlement would be reached before any sale of TikTok is completed and that TikTok may be in a rush to resolve the suits to make itself "more sellable."
- But if the suit becomes a nationwide class action, it could be a legal headache and considerable expense that sticks around TikTok for years to come.
- Microsoft has vowed that if it becomes TikTok's new parent company, all data on American citizens would remain within U.S. borders.
- "To the extent that any such data is currently stored or backed-up outside the United States, Microsoft would ensure that this data is deleted from servers outside the country after it is transferred," Microsoft said in a statement.

- SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A California college student has accused popular video-sharing app TikTok in a class-action lawsuit of transferring private user data to servers in China, despite the company’s assurances that it does not store personal data there.
- The allegations may deepen legal troubles in the United States for TikTok, which is owned by Beijing ByteDance Technology Co but operates entirely outside of China and has developed an especially devoted fan base among U.S. teenagers.
- The company is already facing a U.S. government national security probe over concerns about data storage and possible censorship of political sensitive content.
- The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California last Wednesday and originally reported by The Daily Beast, alleges TikTok has surreptitiously “vacuumed up and transferred to servers in China vast quantities of private and personally-identifiable user data.”
- TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations, but maintains that it stores all U.S. user data in the United States with backups in Singapore.
- The documents identify the plaintiff as Misty Hong, a college student and resident of Palo Alto, California, who downloaded the TikTok app in March or April 2019 but never created an account.
- Months later, she alleges, she discovered that TikTok had created an account for her without her knowledge and produced a dossier of private information about her, including biometric information gleaned from videos she created but never posted.
- According to the filing, TikTok transferred user data to two servers in China - bugly.qq.com and umeng.com - as recently as April 2019, including information about the user’s device and any websites the user had visited.
- Bugly is owned by Tencent, China’s largest mobile software company, which also owns social network WeChat, while Umeng is part of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group.
- The lawsuit also claims that source code from Chinese tech giant Baidu is embedded within the TikTok app, as is code from Igexin, a Chinese advertising service, which security researchers discovered in 2017 was enabling developers to install spyware on a user’s phone.
- The legal documents did not provide evidence of the data transfers or the existence of Baidu or Igexin source code in the app. Hong and her legal representatives could not immediately be reached for comment.
