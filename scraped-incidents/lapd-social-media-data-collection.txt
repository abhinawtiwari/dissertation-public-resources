- The Hill reports that the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has been collecting the social media details of every citizen it interviews, including people who have not been not arrested or accused of a crime.
- Thousands of documents obtained by non-profit organisation The Brennan Center for Justice reveal that LAPD officers must record a civilian’s Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media accounts on 'field interview cards', alongside basic biographical information.
- In a memo, LAPD police chief Michael Moore says interview cards would be reviewed by supervisors to ensure they are complete, so that tey could later be used in 'investigations, arrests, and prosecutions'.
- The findings raise concerns about civil rights and mass surveillance without justification, as well as potential privacy abuse. The LAPD told the Guardian that the field interview card policy was being updated, but 'declined to provide further details.'
- The documents only came to light after the LAPD had refused to hand over documents in a records request filed by The Brennan Center and was sued.

- Documents related to LAPD’s use of social media monitoring.
- On January 30, 2020, the Brennan Center submitted a request under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for information on the department’s use of social media to collect information about individuals, groups, and activities.
- Read the CPRA request here.
- The LAPD acknowledged receipt of the Brennan Center’s request and sent a partial response on February 24, 2020, with two documents that had already been released publicly. On March 12, 2020, the LAPD produced one additional document and closed the request. These responses did not include materials that had already been made available in response to other public records requests or referred to in media articles, indicating that the LAPD’s search was deficient. On November 17, 2020, the Brennan Center filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, with assistance from our pro bono counsel, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP. The suit challenged the LAPD’s inadequate search and failure to produce responsive documents. In response, the LAPD released supplemental productions between March and September 2021.
- In total, the Brennan Center has received twelve sets of documents totaling over 10,000 pages.
- The initial production consists of memos outlining guidelines for officers’ use of social media. A memo from October 2018 outlines procedures to create an official LAPD social media account and policies that govern officer conduct on social media for official business and personal use. These guidelines do not apply to approved undercover activity on social media. A memo from March 2015 introduces the LAPD’s Social Media User Guide, which provides direction on Department-sanctioned uses of social media to advance the LAPD’s community relations mission, develop situational awareness, and act as an investigative tool. The Guide also briefly addresses the First and Fourth Amendment implications of police officers’ use of social media to monitor or collect information.
- Each series after the first production is labeled with consecutive letters. The A-Series consists of a memo from the LAPD’s Chief of Detectives dated April 27, 2018, directing concerned personnel to retain information gleaned from social media that “may disappear before, during, or after a crime.” The memo advises that retaining this information enables investigators to obtain a warrant for a social media account more easily. In a later production, the LAPD produced an instructional video on how officers can preserve information from social media; the video insinuates that African-American men who dress professionally in court are gang members “in real life,” and urges officers to set up a “dummy account” in order to access profiles on the platform.
- The B-series includes three excerpts of emergency operations guides from 2009 and 2010 that direct officers to use social media tools to manage or gather information about “emergent” or “significant incidents.” The last page instructs the LAPD’s intelligence group to coordinate surveillance activities on social media, media information, and internet “chat and postings.”
- The C-Series encompasses several documents, including a section of the Department Manual that describes the Computer Statistics Division (COMPSTAT), the LAPD division responsible for implementing, evaluating, and auditing the production and dissemination of all crime analysis products, including social media monitoring software– although the Brennan Center did not receive any audits of social media monitoring tools as part of the LAPD’s production. COMPSTAT is also responsible for providing training and support for Palantir software and preparing predictive policing reports weekly. (Palantir is a software company specializing in big-data analytics that developed and sells predictive policing software to local and federal law enforcement agencies.) The C-Series also includes a document setting out the Organization and Functions of the LAPD’s Community Relationship Division, an office within the LAPD responsible for social media monitoring until it was disbanded in the fall of 2018.
- The D-series includes the Intelligence Guidelines for the Anti-Terrorism Intelligence Section of the LAPD’s Major Crimes Division. Among other guidelines, this document defines and distinguishes Online Investigative Activity (OIA) and Online Undercover Activity (OUA) for terrorism investigations. Though both involve the use of a “Fictitious Online Persona” as part of an investigation, OUA involves “on-going interactive communication […] with an identified person or group and is related to an ongoing Terrorism Intelligence Investigation,” while OIA appears to account for all other online investigative activity using a fictitious account. Furthermore, while officers engaged in OUA require departmental approval, OIA is mostly unregulated and does not require approval. The Guidelines specify that “Fictitious Online Personas created for the purposes of identifying and examining terrorist trends and tactics, developing profiles, or conducting threat assessments does not constitute Online Undercover Activity,” meaning that LAPD personnel can engage in a significant amount of undercover monitoring online without departmental oversight or accountability.  The D-Series also includes a memo from former LAPD Chief Charlie Beck from May 2015 asking police officers to record subjects’ social media and email account information when completing field interview (FI) cards.
- The E-Series includes emails between LAPD officials and companies that offer social media monitoring services dated between March 2016 and December 2020 – specifically, Geofeedia, Skopenow, and Dataminr. From March to May 2016, officers from the LAPD’s Real-Time Analysis and Critical Response Division (RACR) had a free trial with Dataminr, which was scheduled to coincide with a May Day protest. The LAPD had a demo with Skopenow in June 2019, and multiple trials between November 2018 and July 2020; Skopenow offered services including anonymous analysis of social media and access to the social media platform Parler. The documents also show that the LAPD licensed and used Geofeedia from 2014 to 2016, using funds from the privately funded LAPD Foundation. However, the LAPD stopped using Geofeedia in 2017 because Geofeedia lost access to Twitter and Facebook data after public records requests from the ACLU of Northern California showed that Geofeedia and similar companies were pitching their products as resources to surveil lawful protesters against police violence.
- The F-Series includes emails between the LAPD and sales representatives for Babel Street, a service that surveils English and non-English language sources, dated between May 2016 and April 2020. The LAPD scheduled a demo with Babel Street in May 2016. This series also includes correspondence with DigitalStakeout as the LAPD prepared to apply for a grant for public safety technologies through the U.S. Department of Justice, although the LAPD ultimately did not pursue the grant. DigitalStakeout offers monitoring services using public data from the Internet, social media, and the dark web. There are also unsigned copies of the LAPD’s order forms for Geofeedia from January 2016, which include payment for Geofeedia’s “systems integration” with Palantir, marked as “to be discussed.”
- The G-Series includes email correspondence between the LAPD and Cobwebs, an AI-powered internet monitoring service, dated between May 2019 and October 2020. An email from the LAPD to a Cobwebs sales representative from February 2020 states that the Robbery-Homicide division did not have the budget to license the Cobwebs platform. However, the officer indicated the LAPD was potentially interested in licensing Cobwebs in preparation for the 2028 Olympics. An email from October 2020 indicates that the LA District Attorney’s office was trying out Cobwebs. The same month, the LAPD’s Robbery-Homicide division received a quote for five Cobwebs licenses in preparation for its Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) grant request application.
- The H-Series includes email correspondence from the LAPD with Dataminr and Media Sonar dated between December 2015 and January 2020. The LAPD trialed Dataminr services from March to June 2016 as well as in August 2019. The documents also reveal that the LAPD began receiving pricing proposals from Media Sonar in 2018 and purchased Media Sonar licenses in 2021. In a presentation it submitted as part of its proposal to the LAPD, Media Sonar sells itself as an “online investigation software” that enables users to “Detect potential threats, find new leads, locate witnesses, and improve [users’] crisis management.” The presentation also includes details of a “Digital Footprint” feature that builds “a full digital snapshot of an individual’s online presence including all related personas and connections.” Media Sonar claims to have access to over three hundred data sources with two billion records compiled from public records, “crowd-sourced data,” and more.
- Since 2019, the LAPD has received order forms for two annual premium packages from Media Sonar, one for ten users and another for five. For the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the LAPD applied to purchase Media Sonar licenses through Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) grants from the Department of Homeland Security; these fund technologies that help “high threat, high density areas” prevent and protect against terrorism. According to the grant application, the LAPD would use Media Sonar for assistance “in the constant search for pre-event (terrorism) indicators, protective intelligence, and the efficient response/handling of critical incidents, whether criminal or terror based.” The LAPD’s UASI grant applications for 2020 and 2021 were approved. It is unclear whether the LAPD purchased and used Media Sonar licenses from 2018–2020, but in its response to the Brennan Center’s questions, the LAPD confirmed that it had purchased Media Sonar licenses in 2021 with funds from the UASI grant.
- Furthermore, the grant application shows that the LAPD collaborates with the Joint Regional Intelligence Center, the area’s fusion center, in its use of open-source social media monitoring. The LAPD also produced an undated document with search terms that Geofeedia used for the LAPD’s Community Relationship Division, including #BlackLivesMatter, #BlackLivesMatter-LA, #SayHerName, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, #fuckdonaldtrump, and others.
- The I-Series includes two documents relating to Field Interview (FI) cards. LAPD officers fill out FI cards to document people they have stopped or questioned; these cards can be completed on anyone an officer comes into contact with. The first document is a July 2020 memo from the Chief of Police, Michel Moore, to all LAPD personnel. In the memo, Chief Moore urges officers to diligently record all information in the FI cards, which would be subject to review by Department supervisors “for completeness and validity.” As noted above, former Police Chief Charlie Beck had sent officers a memo in May 2015 telling them to collect social media and email account information in FI cards. The second document is a copy of the FI card form, which shows that the LAPD is gathering subjects’ date of birth and social security number, with a disclaimer stating that subjects are obligated to provide their social security numbers upon an officer’s request. In their October 2020 audit of stops that the LAPD conducted in 2019, the Office of the Inspector General and the Los Angeles Police Commission recommended that the LAPD remove the field to collect social security numbers. Furthermore, the audit notes that the LAPD should revise its policies regarding the FI cards, so officers don’t complete them routinely as part of stops, especially after the LAPD ceased using the CalGang database in July 2020. The audit also emphasizes that members of the public are not under any obligation to answer LAPD officers’ questions to aid them in filling FI cards. The FI cards also have a field to collect social media and email account information. The Brennan Center surveyed other cities’ policies regarding FI cards and found no other police department that collects social media and email account information, though details are sparse.
- The J-Series, released by the Brennan Center on November 17, 2021, includes email correspondence between the LAPD and Voyager Labs (Voyager) dated between October 2018 and March 2021. The documents reveal that the LAPD conducted a four-month trial of the company’s VoyagerAnalytics software between July and November 2019. Voyager touts its products’ “unique collection methods [that] enable traceless collection from social media networks,” which Voyager claims allow users to reconstruct closed profiles and closed Facebook groups based on publicly available information, as well as to uncover the strength and relationship type of people’s connections on social media. Voyager also claims its tools can identify people that are “most invested in a given stance: emotionally, ideologically, and personally.” The LAPD was particularly interested in the VoyagerGenesis tool, which analyzes warrant returns for social media information within minutes. Voyager also promoted its VoyagerCheck tool that automatically vets social media profiles based on a user’s list of predetermined questions.
- To demonstrate these capabilities, Voyager sent the LAPD a case study from March 2020 titled “COVID-19 Outbreak: Investigating a Threat Actor.” Using the VoyagerAnalytics tool, the company analyzed the network of Bahgat Saber, a Muslim Brotherhood activist from New York City, after he told his followers to deliberately infect members of the Egyptian consulate with Covid-19. Voyager analyzed biographical information for Saber and his nearly 4,000 followers. Subsequently, Voyager analyzed Saber’s “indirect connections” (friends of friends), touting that it had found “affinity of at least some of Saber’s network for violent, radical ideologies.” Voyager also found that fifty-eight of Saber’s connections indicated that they lived in New York City. Of those living in New York City, Voyager classifies two people as threats because they work in U.S. government agencies, are associated with Saber, and have connections to “known extremist accounts.” In short, the case study presents a roadmap for guilt by association, classifying people as threats based on an artificial intelligence tool’s assessment of their direct and indirect connections on social media.
- Voyager also sent the LAPD an undated white paper describing its capabilities with reference to the case of Adam Alsahli, who attacked the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station in May 2020. Voyager claimed that its tool can automatically vet and classify people by their risk of becoming Islamic fundamentalists. The results are color-coded (green, orange, and red) based on “artificial intelligence calibrations,” which Voyager describes as providing insights in minutes without human involvement. For Alsahli, Voyager highlights the fact that he posted “pictures with Islamic themes” that reflect “his pride in and identification with his Arab heritage” on Facebook and Instagram, and that AI analysis of these posts yielded an “orange” indicator.
- In some correspondence with Voyager, the LAPD suggested that it did not want to use features that could be perceived as “active monitoring” of social media. In one instance, an LAPD representative asked Voyager not to activate a feature that would allow the LAPD to track changes in content and connections on a social media profile because it was too close to “active monitoring.” In another email, an LAPD representative expressed concerns about Voyager’s monitoring capabilities because of public outcry over law enforcement’s use of Geofeedia.
- The series also includes several pricing proposals and price quotes that Voyager sent to the LAPD in 2019 and 2020. The LAPD and Voyager were discussing finalizing procurement, but the LAPD was unable to purchase VoyagerAnalytics licenses in 2020; the reason given was projected budget shortfalls during the Covid-19 pandemic.
- This series also includes email correspondence from the LAPD with EDGE NPD dated between September 2020 and March 2021, which the Brennan Center released on December 15, 2021. EDGE NPD is a European software development company that created ABTShield, a social media monitoring tool that purportedly uncovers disinformation campaigns. In its promotional materials for the LAPD, EDGE NPD pitched ABTShield as a tool to help the LAPD at a time when “[the department] is being targeted by organized attacks of automated bots and trolls (e.g., police brutality misinformation and ‘defund the police’ narratives).” An LAPD representative put forward this narrative as well, asserting in an email to Dobromir Ciaś, the CEO of EDGE NPD, that there were “state-backed media outlets sowing division between law enforcement and the communities we protect.”
- The LAPD conducted a trial of ABTShield in October and November 2020. As part of its trial, the LAPD received daily updates containing Twitter activity related to topics of interest the Department selected: domestic extremism and white nationalism, potential danger, civil unrest, election security, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and American policing. To search through Twitter, the LAPD and EDGE NPD compiled an extensive list of keywords, which included words and phrases related to Black Lives Matter protests, white supremacist and domestic terror groups, the 2020 election, and more. The Brennan Center received a list with keywords that the LAPD requested, but EDGE NPD subsequently added additional terms and the LAPD agreed to the additions. According to the LAPD, it did not receive the final list of keywords used by ABTShield from EDGE NPD.
- Finally, the K-Series, released by the Brennan Center on December 15, 2021, contained Excel files from the LAPD’s trial of ABTShield. On average, ABTShield sent the LAPD approximately 70,000 tweets every day (almost 2 million tweets in total) in three different spreadsheets: tweets with Los Angeles-specific content, tweets from Los Angeles (identified through Twitter’s geolocation tools), and English-language tweets. The spreadsheets include the content of the tweet, the originating account, and how many people viewed the tweet (i.e., the tweet’s reach). Additionally, ABTShield compiled over 1,400 tweets from social media handles that the LAPD requested ABTShield track; ABTShield tagged these tweets almost entirely as related to American policing and civil unrest. The Brennan Center’s review of the spreadsheet indicates that the LAPD tracked at least three accounts — two anti-fascist groups and one account that provides updates on protests based on information obtained through police scanners and civilian reports.
- Additionally, on April 28, 2021, the LAPD sent a letter to the Brennan Center accompanying its supplemental document production. In the letter, the LAPD represented that it had not conducted any audits regarding the Department’s use of social media monitoring. The Department also stated that records reflecting warnings or disciplinary action against LAPD employees for their use of social media are “confidential and non-disclosable,” and were therefore not produced.
- On June 25, 2021, the LAPD sent a letter responding to the Brennan Center’s questions about the produced documents. The letter reveals that the LAPD obtained funding through a UASI grant in 2021 to procure Media Sonar licenses; however, the LAPD stated that it is not using other products listed in the UASI grant application, such as Skopenow, Cobwebs, ABTShield, and VoyagerAnalytics. The LAPD also represented that while the Department will be using Media Sonar in FY 2021, it has not signed a contract with the company. Although the LAPD’s September 2021 After-Action Report Implementation Plan states that the LAPD is using Voyager, the LAPD’s counsel believed this reference is an error.
- On July 13, 2021, the LAPD sent a letter responding to the Brennan Center’s questions about the produced documents. The LAPD represented that it does not track how many field interview (FI) cards officers complete, nor the number of unique individuals about whom FI cards are completed.
- On December 8, 2021, the LAPD responded to the Brennan Center’s questions about the keyword list used by ABTShield for the LAPD’s pilot. According to the LAPD, EDGE NPD did not provide a final version of the keyword list used in the trial to the Department.
- The technology used by police disproportionately tracked Twitter activity surrounding protests.
- Voyager Labs claims that social media posts and friend lists can predict “extremism.”
- The Brennan Center for Justice filed public records requests in Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Baltimore, and Washington, DC seeking information about their police departments’ use of social media monitoring.

- An internal police chief memo shows employees were directed to use ‘field interview cards’ which would then be reviewed
- The Los Angeles police department (LAPD) has directed its officers to collect the social media information of every civilian they interview, including individuals who are not arrested or accused of a crime, according to records shared with the Guardian.
- Copies of the “field interview cards” that police complete when they question civilians reveal that LAPD officers are instructed to record a civilian’s Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media accounts, alongside basic biographical information. An internal memo further shows that the police chief, Michel Moore, told employees that it was critical to collect the data for use in “investigations, arrests, and prosecutions”, and warned that supervisors would review cards to ensure they were complete.
- The documents, which were obtained by the not-for-profit organization the Brennan Center for Justice, have raised concerns about civil liberties and the potential for mass surveillance of civilians without justification.
- “There are real dangers about police having all of this social media identifying information at their fingertips,” said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, a deputy director at the Brennan Center, noting that the information was probably stored in a database that could be used for a wide range of purposes.
- The Brennan Center conducted a review of 40 other police agencies in the US and was unable to find another department that required social media collection on interview cards (though many have not publicly disclosed copies of the cards). The organization also obtained records about the LAPD’s social media surveillance technologies, which have raised questions about the monitoring of activist groups including Black Lives Matter.
- In 2015, the department added “social media accounts” as a line on the physical field interview cards, according to a newly unearthed memo from the previous LAPD chief, Charlie Beck. “Similar to a nickname or an alias, a person’s online persona or identity used for social media … can be highly beneficial to investigations,” he wrote.
- While the social media collection has gone largely unnoticed, the LAPD’s use of field interview cards has prompted controversy. Last October, prosecutors filed criminal charges against three officers in the LAPD’s metro division, accusing them of using the cards to falsely label civilians as gang members after stopping them. That unit also has a history of stopping Black drivers at disproportionately high rates, and according to the LA Times, has more frequently filled out cards for Black and Latino residents they stopped.
- Meanwhile, more than half of the civilians stopped by metro officers and documented in the cards were not arrested or cited, the Times reported. The fact that a department under scrutiny for racial profiling was also engaged in broad scale social media account collection is troubling, said Levinson-Waldman.
- Furthermore, when police obtain social media usernames it opens the door for officers to monitor an individual’s connections and “friends” online, creating additional privacy concerns. “It allows for a huge expansion of network surveillance,” said Levinson-Waldman, noting how police and prosecutors have previously used Facebook photos and “likes” to make dubious or false allegations of criminal gang activity.
- Hamid Khan of the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition noted that the LAPD also shares data with federal law enforcement agencies through “fusion centers”, and has previously used “predictive policing” technologies that rely on data collected by officers in the field and which can criminalize communities of color.
- “This is like stop and frisk,” he said, of the use of field interview cards. “And this is happening with the clear goal of surveillance.” The LAPD, he noted, has allowed officers to pose undercover to investigate groups, meaning officers can create fake social media accounts to infiltrate groups.
- Dr Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter LA, said she had long suspected the LAPD conducted “targeted tracking” of specific groups or individual accounts, but was surprised to learn of the default collection of this information in everyday encounters. She fears this could be part of “a massive surveillance operation”.
- The copies of the cards obtained by the Brennan Center also revealed that police are instructed to ask civilians for their social security numbers and are advised to tell interviewees that “it must be provided” under federal law. Kathleen Kim, a Loyola law professor and immigrants’ rights expert, who previously served on the LA police commission, said she was not aware of any law requiring individuals to disclose social security numbers to local police.
- And she said she was shocked to learn about the social security section on the cards, noting that it was “so antithetical to the department’s own policies” and clearly violated the spirit of sanctuary laws, which are supposed to prevent officers from asking civilians their immigration status. The LAPD had previously taken steps to ensure it was not requesting place of birth information to improve trust with undocumented communities, she said.
- The LAPD told the Guardian on Tuesday that the field interview card policy was “being updated”, but declined to provide further details.
- The revelations of broad social media data collection also raised concerns about how police monitor activists.
- The Brennan Center obtained LAPD documents related to Geofeedia, a private social media monitoring firm that partners with law enforcement and has previously marketed itself as a tool to monitor BLM protests.
- One internal document, which is undated but appeared to be several years old, listed the “keywords” and hashtags that the LAPD appeared to be monitoring through Geofeedia – and they were almost exclusively related to Black Lives Matter and similar leftist protests. It included #BLMLA, #SayHerName, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, #fuckdonaldtrump and the names of people killed by LA police that prompted major protests.
- The list did not include any hashtags for rightwing demonstrations and far-right movements, which have grown increasingly violent in recent years in the region.
- The context in which these search terms were used is unclear from the records provided, and the LAPD did not respond to questions. The city attorney’s office said the LAPD stopped using Geofeedia around 2017 and that the agency did not have a current list of keywords for social media monitoring.
- Abdullah, who helped organize around many of the hashtags the LAPD was monitoring, noted that BLM’s actions were non-violent: “They’re following Black protesters who are organizing to stop violence and saying, ‘Stop killing us’ … And are they turning a blind eye to those who are actually violent: the white supremacist organizations that are growing in number?”
- In a 2016 memo to LAPD included in the records, another social media tracking company, Dataminr, listed under “success stories” its tracking of a BLMLA protest outside a jail, saying the firm “uncovered the first images of people at the protest”, as well as its tracking of a protest featuring “a giant blowup statue of Trump”. The local news site, LA Taco, reported last week that LAPD had used Dataminr to monitor last year’s BLM protests for George Floyd.
- Jacinta González, an organizer with advocacy group, Mijente, said the LAPD records appeared to fit a pattern of how police in America respond to protest organizations: “There is a long history of law enforcement using surveillance, whether in-person or through digital technologies to attack Black and Latino movements fighting for racial justice.”
- The Brennan Center’s records further revealed the LAPD is now seeking to use technology from a new company, Media Sonar, which also tracks social media for police. In the 2021 budget, the LAPD allotted $73,000 to purchase Media Sonar software to help the department “address a potential threat or incident before its occurrence”.
- The extent of the LAPD’s Media Sonar use is unclear, but the company’s communications with the LAPD have raised questions. In one message, the firm said its services can be used to “stay on-top of drug/gang/weapon slang keywords and hashtags”. Levinson-Waldman said she feared the company or police would misinterpret “slang” or lack proper context on local groups and language, and she noted research showing that online threats made by gang-affiliated youth largely don’t escalate to violence.
- Media Sonar also told the LAPD it offers “pre-built keyword groups” to “help jumpstart implementation” of threat models, and helps police “cast a wide net”. The firm also said it could provide a “full digital snapshot of an individual’s online presence including all related personas and connections”.
- The messages from Media Sonar suggested that the department needed significant safeguards to ensure that keywords didn’t disparately target marginalized communities and checks to ensure the data was accurate, Levinson-Waldman said.
- Records show that the LAPD has requested federal funding for Media Sonar for “terrorism prevention”, but some advocates are concerned it would be used for protests. In March, a city council report analyzing the LAPD’s response to BLM protests recommended the department purchase software to analyze social media content.
- Media Sonar did not respond to inquiries about its relationship with the LAPD. The LAPD did not respond to requests for comment about Media Sonar.

- Story at a glance:
- The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has authorized its officers to collect social media information on every civilian they interview, even if they are not arrested or accused of a crime, according to The Guardian and a new report.
- The report by the Brennan Center for Justice analyzes internal documents from the LAPD. The nonprofit group found that, since the LAPD’s 2015 Social Media User Guide, the “department encourages social media monitoring but has issued little guidance and imposed minimal oversight over officers’ surveillance on social media platforms.”
- LAPD officers are instructed to record someone’s Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media accounts when filling out their basic biographical information, according to The Guardian. Further, Police Chief Michael Moore reportedly pressed employees to collect the data to use in “investigations, arrests, and prosecutions,” according to the outlet.

- In its report, Brennan Center for Justice says it believes these field interview cards could pave the way for unlawful mass surveillance.
- “There are real dangers about police having all of this social media identifying information at their fingertips,” Rachel Levinson-Waldman, deputy director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty & National Security Program, told The Guardian.
- The data gets submitted to Palantir, a system that LAPD uses to aggregate data from an array of sources to increase surveillance and analytics, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.
- Palantir can be used to map someone’s whereabouts and personal relationships. It can also be used to check someone’s DMV records, license plate reader data, employment data, arrest records, field interview card data and other sources.

- The Los Angeles Police Department has been collecting the social media profiles of anyone they talk to - whether they committed a crime or not - for years, a practice that activists compare to 'stop and frisk' as it puts them in danger of being targeted.
- The department also tracked social media posts with 'keywords' that were entirely related to left-wing movements, such as the hashtags #BLMLA, #sayhername and #f***donaldtrump.
- The revelations were detailed in documents released Wednesday by the Brennan Center for Justice, a liberal nonprofit at New York University's School of Law.
- They center got a deluge of 6,000 records after suing the LAPD in November 2020, alleging that the department didn't hand over everything it asked for in a records request in January of that year.
- Beck's 2015 memo was part of a cache of 6,000 pages given to the Brennan Center for Justice by the LAPD after the center sued the department for information last year
- An LAPD field interview card, used for interviewing suspects but also innocent witnesses and citizens. On the back, it has a space for the interviewee's  social media accounts
- Activists were surprised by the surveillance revealed in Los Angeles Police Department records. Above, officers watch over Black Lives Matter protesters in Los Angeles in June 2020
- In a memo dated May 27, 2015, then-Police Chief Charlie Beck instructed officers to ask for a person's 'social media and e-mail account information' when completing a field interview report, which is done when interviewing witnesses or others at a scene.
- 'Similar to a nickname or an alias, a person's online persona or identity used for social media and communication can be highly beneficial to investigators and possibly even future outreach programs,' Beck said.
- In an undated document, the LAPD revealed that it used Geofeedia to track various 'keywords'
- 'There are real dangers about police having all of this social media identifying information at their fingertips,' Brennan Center deputy director Rachel Levinson-Waldman told the Guardian.
- 'It allows for a huge expansion of network surveillance.'
- LAPD field interview cards have their own section for social media accounts - even though the cards can be used with innocents citizens or witnesses.
- At least six officers were charged last year after they allegedly misidentified people they had stopped as gang members in interview cards.
- Rene Braga, Raul Uribe and Julio Garcia were charged with preparing false documentary evidence by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office last year. Braga was also hit with a count of filing a false police report.
- 'In all three cases, the defendants are accused of writing on the card that a person admitted to being a gang member even though body-worn camera video showed the defendants either never asked the individuals about their gang membership or the individuals denied gang membership if they were asked,' the a news release by the DA's office said.
- Three other officers - Braxton Shaw, Michael Coblentz and Nicolas Martinez - were hit with similar counts, according to the New York Daily News.
- In a statement to DailyMail.com, the LAPD says it still uses the cards, which have been updated but still contain a space for social media information.
- 'The information on these cards is used to help our officers memorialize what was said in field interviews and stay in contact with people who can help us solve crimes,' the department said.
- 'Social media handles can be critical pieces of contact information, along with phone numbers and email addresses, because people communicate through social media now just as frequently as they do through calls, texts or emails.'
- Records also show that LAPD officers were instructed to tell civilians they 'must' hand over their social security numbers if asked to do so by police.
- Kathleen Kim, a Loyola law professor and immigrants' rights expert who previously served on the LA police commission, told the Guardian that she was not aware of any law requiring people to disclose social security numbers to local police.
- The revelations come as ethicists, companies and activists debate the scope of surveillance that police departments have thanks to social media and technology.
- Hamid Khan of the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition compared the collection of social media information to 'stop and frisk,' a policy commonly used in New York City where police can detain and search people based on suspicion alone.
- 'And this is happening with the clear goal of surveillance,' Khan said.
- Another internal document, which is undated, listed 'keywords' that the LAPD appeared to be monitoring using Geofeedia, a private social media monitoring firm that promotes itself to police departments by highlighting its collection of posts from protests in Ferguson, Missouri after the police killing of Michael Brown in 2014, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union.
- Among the keywords were the hashtags #BLMLA, #f***donaldtrump, #BlackLivesMatter, #BLMLA, #EricGarcetti, and the words Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and Loretta Lynch.
- The LAPD mostly monitored left-wing hashtags. It's unclear if it still is, though one website says it used another company to monitor last year's George Floyd protests, above
- The website L.A. Taco reported that the LAPD used Dataminr, a similar software, to track last year's protests after the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.
- Melina Abdullah, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter LA, said she had long suspected the LAPD was conducting 'targeted tracking.'
- 'They're following black protesters who are organizing to stop violence and saying, 'Stop killing us' … And are they turning a blind eye to those who are actually violent: the white supremacist organizations that are growing in number?'
- Lauren Bridges, a PhD candidate at University of Pennsylvania, previously told the Guardian that one in ten police departments in the US have access to footage from Amazon's Ring doorbell cameras.
- She said the tech giant 'is effectively building the largest corporate-owned, civilian-installed surveillance network that the US has ever seen.'
- Ring camera owners have to consent to give the footage to police departments to use the footage, once a crime has been committed in the area, but the cameras can capture neighbors at home without their consent.
- Last year, the CEO of IBM wrote a letter to Congress saying it was shutting down its facial recognition offerings after the death of George Floyd.
- 'IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and principles of trust and transparency,' CEO Arvind Krishna said in a letter to Congress.
- Social media companies are cooperating with law enforcement agencies by handing over data leading to the arrest of the MAGA rioters who stormed the United States Capitol on January 6.
- The 'digital dragnet' involves investigators monitoring social media for posts and videos recorded by the rioters themselves - similar to what investigators did during the George Floyd protests over the summer.
- As more indictments are being handed down against the Capitol rioters, tech companies are reportedly showing their willingness to hand over incriminating data, according to Huffington Post.
- Jesus Rivera, one of the Trump supporters who has been charged, is one suspect who was indicted after Facebook turned over information to the FBI that purports to show him inside the Capitol crypt.
- Rivera had recorded a five-minute video of himself among the rioters, but then disabled and deleted his Facebook.
- MAGA rioters clash with police outside the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, on January 6. Federal investigators have relied on data from tech companies including Facebook to identify and charge suspects
- Protesters scuffle with police in Washington, DC, in May just days after the police-involved death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, in Minneapolis. Law enforcement officials trawled Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to monitor and arrest protesters, rioters, and looters

- 'That Facebook account has since been disabled or deleted however a Facebook index page, provided to the FBI in the return of a Federal Search Warrant, listed several identifiers that correspond with Rivera,' an FBI special agent assigned to Rivera's case wrote in the criminal complaint.
- 'These identifiers include Rivera's last name, first initials, three phone numbers attributed to Rivera in open source, the payment name 'Jesus Rivera' and a city of residence of Pensacola, Florida, which matches Rivera's city of residence.'
- 
- Another MAGA rioter who was charged, 40-year-old Christopher Spencer, livestreamed videos to Facebook from inside the Capitol where he can be heard looking for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
- Those videos were provided to the FBI by Facebook 'as part of a search warrant return.'
- Christopher Raphael Spencer, 40 (left), was arrested in North Carolina in connection to his alleged role in the January 6 siege of the US Capitol. Spencer is pictured on the right in a screenshot from one of his livestreams from inside the Capitol. The livestream was allegedly provided to law enforcement officials by Facebook
- The criminal complaint against Spencer cites statements made by an informant, but it appears that law enforcement spoke to the informant after getting information from Facebook.
- These two case filings suggest that Facebook, Google, and other tech and telecom firms may have in their possession information that could lead to the arrests of scores of other suspects.
- The very act of stepping inside the US Capitol during the riot constitutes a crime, so data location taken by smartphone apps is all the incriminating evidence that law enforcement officials need to bring charges.

- So far, more than 135 people have been charged with a litany of crimes in connection with the MAGA riot, including unlawful entry and disorderly conduct.
- Federal investigators have received more than 200,000 tips, many of them digital evidence that likely includes social media content that puts the suspects at the location.
- In almost all instances, law enforcement officials have relied on the rioters' own social media posts to identify them and charge them with a crime.
- If the rioters deleted their accounts, investigators could subpoena the social media companies, who would then be legally obligated to hand them over.
- Defense attorneys have long complained that big tech firms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google comply with law enforcement subpoenas while denying their clients access to data that might be exculpatory, according to Wired.
- Local police often get access to private social media records, including direct messages, that can then be used to investigate and prosecute suspects.
- During massive, wide scale unrest like the protests and riots that unfolded after the police-involved killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last spring, investigators have increasingly relied on social media to identify criminal suspects.
- In July, Politico reported that federal and local law enforcement agents went undercover online by posing as activists sympathetic to social justice protesters.
- Investigators mined data from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to identify extremists, looters, and vandals who were alleged to have stirred up unrest.
- In one particular case, police in Page, Arizona, received a tip indicating that a man, Loren Reed, set up a private Facebook chat group in which he allegedly encouraged people to riot at the county courthouse.
- A police officer went undercover and messaged Reed via Facebook.
- 'I wanna burn down the courthouse,' Reed wrote to the undercover officer.
- Another Florida resident, Jesus Rivera, 37, also was arrested for his role in the MAGA riot based on video that was handed over to investigators by Facebook +5
- Another Florida resident, Jesus Rivera, 37, also was arrested for his role in the MAGA riot based on video that was handed over to investigators by Facebook
- Police then continued to monitor the group's chat over the course of the next few days.
- In one message, Reed is alleged to have written: 'Arson, Assault, Conspiracy, here we come.'
- Reed is also alleged to have urged other members in the group to gather fireworks, Molotov cocktails, and other flammables and loot a local pharmacy.
- Investigators managed to obtain Reed's cell phone number through his Facebook page and then employed a 'lawful investigative technique' to find the location of Reed's device.
- Just four days after undercover cops contacted Reed through Facebook, he was arrested and charged with a felony.
- Court records indicated that the FBI used social media posts by Black Lives Matter protesters to arrest them for inciting riots, according to NBC News.
- On at least four occasions, federal authorities charged protesters with incitement to riot solely on the basis of social media posts.
- One person was charged after posting a widely available recipe for crude napalm online.
- Another man was reportedly questioned by the FBI after joking online that he was the head of the local chapter of the far-left agitator group antifa.

- The Los Angeles Police Department has reportedly instructed its officers to record the social media information of every interviewed civilian — even those "who are not arrested or accused of a crime," The Guardian reports, according to records obtained by the Brennan Center for Justice.
- What's more, an internal memo shows Police Chief Michael Moore warning officers that supervisors would review their "field interview cards" — the paper on which the social accounts, among other things, are disclosed — to ensure they were complete. Such broad scale collection has alarmed activists and civil liberties pundits, concerned about the "potential for mass surveillance of civilians without justification," writes the Guardian.
- "There are real dangers about police having all of this social media identifying information at their fingertips," said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, a deputy director at the Brennan Center. When officers obtain these usernames, "it allows for a huge expansion of network surveillance," she added.
- The Brennan Center reportedly analyzed 40 other U.S. police agencies and was unable to locate another department that "required social media collection on interview cards," though many have not publicly disclosed those records, the Guardian notes. Said Hamid Khan of the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition: "This is like stop and frisk," and it's "happening with the clear goal of surveillance."
- In other instances, police have asked civilians and interviewees for their social security numbers, claiming "it must be provided" under federal law. Kathleen Kim, a Loyola law professor and immigrants' rights expert, said such a question violates the spirit of sanctuary laws preventing officers from inquring about immigration status.
- On Tuesday, the LAPD told the Guardian that the field interview card policy was being updated, but "declined to provide further details." Read more at The Guardian.

- The Brennan Center has released a cache of 6,000 pages of Los Angeles Police Department documents, obtained by the California Public Records Act, detailing years of surveillance campaigns. The collection is a critical resource for activists, journalists, and First Amendment advocates who’ve been collecting evidence that the LAPD habitually spies on residents, particularly on activists and people of color with records or, simply, “gang affiliations.” It also builds a strong case that police have way too many resources and time on their hands.
- The expansive view into police use of social media, which spans from 2009 into 2021, shows cops covertly posing with pseudonyms and using predictive policing to monitor people they suspect are likely to commit crimes, in some cases with almost no oversight. New documents show that the department plans to roll out a program that monitors connections between individuals.
- First, the LAPD has been watching virtually every peephole. An excerpt from a 2010 intelligence-gathering manual states that officers should gather information during “almost any incident,” achieved by several divisions monitoring Twitter, Facebook, “internet chats and postings,” radio frequencies, virtually all video cameras operated by the LAPD, as well as the FBI and other agencies. It adds that scouts should collect information “no matter the source.”
- In some cases, monitoring Twitter involved monitoring a particular person, rather than just an event; police attempted to get people to hand over their social media accounts along with identifying information. A standard Field Interview (FI) card, a form officers fill out when stopping a person, leaves a blank field for Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other profiles. At the bottom, another asks for a Social Security number, with a notice stating that officers can order the subject to give it over by law. In 2020, Chief of Police Michel Moore instructed officers via email that information on the FI cards should be recorded “thoroughly,” and that the department would review them for “completeness.”
- Other documents more explicitly reveal that officers are gathering information even when there’s no crime, i.e., using predictive policing, which the LAPD embraced early. Predictive policing measures pop up in a 2016 description of the LAPD’s Computer Statistics (COMPSTAT) wing, which is tasked with monitoring “crime analysis products” that assess “crime series, patterns, hot spots, trends, clusters, spikes and/or offenders for the purpose of arresting and prosecuting criminals.”
- Predictive policing uses an amassment of crime statistics to monitor location-based “hot spots” and also information used to mark people with criminal records but also histories of drug use. Research has repeatedly found that predictive policing tools further entrench racist policing practices. The LAPD stopped using the program LASER, for example, in 2019 after the inspector general found that among other things, the program allowed police to stop people on the “Chronic Offenders” list merely for being on the list, and a name could end up on the list for fuzzily-defined reasons such as supposed gang affiliation. It was also unclear whether someone ended up on the list even if they were arrested but weren’t convicted of a crime. It also ended the use of PredPol, a popular location-based predictive policing tool, in 2020 on the grounds that the department was “belt-tightening” amid the covid-19 pandemic.
- The use of predictive algorithms in criminal justice has also been found to perpetuate racial profiling and can baselessly lengthen arrests records. Longer records are considered by more racist predictive programs that assess recidivism likelihood and lengthen prison sentences.
- As the Brennan Center notes, COMPSTAT now uses Palantir software. The company offers the ability to map out online connections, explicitly including “gang” networks, which could extend more thin reasoning to zero in on innocent people. The FI cards were also added to the Palantir database, according to a September 2020 BuzzFeed report.
- This will come as no surprise to activists, but more evidence reveals an interest in tracking crowds. A 2016 email chain shows an LAPD officer telling a representative from Dataminr that they planned to use the social media monitoring software at the May Day protest; last year, the Intercept reported that Dataminr compiled reams of predictive data on Black Lives Matter protesters’ plans and locations. Knowing where a crowd plans to be helps police head off and kettle protesters, creating a wall of officers to trap marchers and, in the LAPD’s case, allegedly attack them with riot weapons, round them up, and zip-tie them. The LAPD also had trial uses with Skopenow and demonstrably used Geofeedia, the released documents show. While the department reportedly stopped using Geofeedia after Facebook and Twitter blocked access to the software, an undated document shows that they’d used a list of Geofeedia search terms including #BlackLivesMatter, Tamir Rice, and #SayHerName.
- Further, the LAPD appears to be expanding its powers. This year, it bought a license for Media Sonar, which told the LAPD that, per the department’s request, it can enable “open-source searching of individuals.” In a lengthy slide presentation, Media Sonar promised that it would track communications, build profiles with identifying networks of their connections for “unexpected leads,” permanently store posts even after they’ve been deleted, and track “gang/drug/weapon” slang. It can even “learn relevant slang and names,” which, as Brennan Center fellow Mary Pat Dwyer points out in a breakdown, “the highly contextual nature of social media ... makes it ripe for misinterpretation.”
- That same explanation was used by an LAPD sergeant who was disciplined for posting, among other racist rants, that Nipsey Hussle “chose the lifestyle that ultimately killed him” because he “perpetuated the criminal gang lifestyle.” The department has since implemented a rule that prohibits officers from using police insignia along with harassing and racist posts, but if it wants to connect their Social Security numbers with their social accounts and monitor them for “slang,” it certainly could. (The Brennan Center has also compiled a catalog of 35 police departments’ social media policies, which it will continue to update.)
- The trove holds exceptional value because we often get only piecemeal clues as to what surveillance methods police departments are using until after it’s too late. Last year, BuzzFeed News confronted the LAPD with evidence that it had used Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology, which has scraped unnumbered photos from social media without users’ consent. The LAPD banned the use of facial recognition after BuzzFeed’s inquiries, but the outlet discovered that officers had already used the software to conduct 475 searches over a three-month period.
