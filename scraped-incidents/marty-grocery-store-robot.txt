- Marty is a 6-foot-3, 140-pound service robot that detects and alerts managers to spills, scans shelves for out-of-date items, and price discrepancies in over 500 GIANT/MARTIN'S, Stop & Shop and other supermarkets across the USA.
- Developed by Badger Technologies, Marty uses embedded cameras and sensors to navigate and avoid customers and store displays and costs approximately USD 35,000.
- Marty has been met by a mixture of intrigue, amusement, confusion, and incredulity by supermarket shoppers. Some people have taken to social media to express their concerns that they appear to be being watched; others think Marty is weird and creepy.
- Marty's introduction has also prompted some supermarket employees to complain that Marty appears to do relatively little, get in the way, and create more work when they go wrong.
- Meantime, unionists and employment protection advocates voiced their concerns that Marty and similar robots will replace employee jobs, with some pointing out that Marty's introduction coincided with a major strike over compensation issues.
- According to the Association for Advancing Automation (A3), Marty 'may result in significant cost savings ... with employees spend(ing) hours per day checking for hazards and checking inventory.'
- 'The impact on workers appears to be small' A3 says, 'since Marty primarily alerts workers to problems. As the technology grows and additional functions are added like stocking shelves, workers may be freed up to perform other tasks, including deploying and maintaining the service robots.'
- Unionists and civil rights activists worry that Marty can easily be used for additional purposes, thereby putting extra strain on workers and leading to job losses. Per The Counter, Ahold Delieze has informed investors that it is investing in automation and AI to supplement or replace human labour.
- 'We are partnering on technologies that are not only helping us make the customer experience even more personal and relevant but also operate more efficiently and manage labor shortages in our markets. This includes exciting new collaborations in artificial intelligence and robotics' the company says in its 2018 Annual Report.

- Out-of-stocks. Empty shelves. Price discrepancies. Planogram inconsistencies. They all happen—and they all cost you. The Badger Technologies autonomous robot will scan shelves and automatically address these operational inefficiencies.
- The cameras on board allow the Badger robot to see not only in high-resolution detail, but also in 3D. This powerful optics package allows for smooth in-store navigation and high fidelity data acquisition.
- The Badger robot was designed with retail in mind. In addition to high-resolution cameras and rotating lidar, the Badger robot comes equipped with a suite of sensors that keep it clear of shoppers or other objects.
- While the Badger robot is a headline grabbing piece of hardware, much of the real excitement is hidden inside. With fully upgradeable firmware, new solutions and new possibilities are just a software update away.
- We know a new system is only as good as its ability to connect with your existing stack. That’s why the Badger robot's software was designed from the ground up, with a custom system integration in mind.
- Advanced lidar (like radar but with laser technology) is yet one more way the Badger robot sees its surroundings. As it passes through your store, the Badger robot is able to smoothly navigate and constantly map an ever-changing environment.
- While the Badger robot is programmed to return to its charging station after a cycle, there is plenty of power on board for a full day of uninterrupted work. Equipped with a 12 hour rechargeable battery, the Badger robot can keep up with the high pace of retail environments.

- Salisbury, North Carolina, UNITED STATES
- SALISBURY, N.C., Jan.  14, 2019  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nearly 500 robots will be coming to neighborhood grocery stores thanks to a partnership between Retail Business Services and Badger Technologies™, a product division of Jabil. Ahold Delhaize USA brands GIANT/MARTIN’S and Stop & Shop have elected to bring the robots to nearly 500 of their stores following successful pilots that improved in-store efficiencies and safety.
- “As part of our continued focus on technology transformation, we’re pleased to support one of the most significant deployments of robotics innovation in the grocery retail industry,” said Paul Scorza, EVP and Chief Information Officer for Retail Business Services. “Several companies in the grocery retail space have recently begun testing or using in-store robots – something Retail Business Services and the local brands we serve have been doing for some time. We’re pleased to support the GIANT/MARTIN’S and Stop & Shop brands as they now lead the industry from test to large-scale usage of robots and to see the benefits the technology continues to drive for their businesses.”
- The in-store robots, named Marty, were easily recognized by customers in stores by their friendly appearance where they were tested and used to identify hazards, such as liquid, powder and bulk food item spills and provide reporting that enables corrective action. They help stores mitigate risk caused by such spills, as well as enabled associates to spend more time serving and interfacing with customers.
- “We are excited to be part of this industry-leading rollout of fully autonomous robots that collect safety data while traversing retail stores,” said Frederic McCoy, SVP, Jabil Retail. “Real-time hazard alerts empower stores to resolve incidents like spills, as well as improve operations.”
- The deployment of robots at GIANT/MARTIN’s and Stop & Shop is now underway and will continue through the early part of 2019. Other Ahold Delhaize USA brands continue to test with autonomous robots in select stores.

- Robots may soon be perusing the aisles of your neighborhood grocery store.
- Robotic assistants will alert managers to spills and other hazards in nearly 500 Stop & Shop, Giant Food Stores and Giant Martin's stores, parent company Ahold Delhaize USA announced Monday. And unlike the scarier robots often depicted on TV or in films, these machines have a decidedly friendly appearance.
- Dubbed "Marty," the in-store robots will be used to identify potential safety hazards such as spills of liquid, powder or bulk food items in store aisles and to issue an alert for clean up.
- Robots are performing many tasks at other retailers. Walmart plans to have 360 robotic mops scrubbing store floors starting this month, and Amazon is using artificial intelligence to rid stores in Seattle and Chicago of cashiers and checkout lines.
- In addition to owning PeaPod and several other brands, Ahold Delhaize operates 414 Stop & Shops in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island; 171 Giant Martin's in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia; and 167 Giant Food Stores.

- Attention shoppers: I've seen the future of grocery store technology, and let me tell you, we can do better.
- I’m no Marty McFly. I simply reside in a small Connecticut town, which means that in addition to doing Extremely New England things like commuting to the city on the Metro North, bragging about beaches, and the fact that the state inspired the picturesque fictional town(opens in a new tab) in Gilmore Girls, I occasionally spend some time on the weekends shopping for groceries at a local Stop & Shop.
- Prior to 2019, the Stop & Shop shopping experience was similar to that offered by most any other large grocery store chain. But this year, Stop & Shop introduced giant, gray, aisle-patrolling robots at more than 200 stores(opens in a new tab) in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Jersey.
- Now, food shopping comes with unprecedented levels of anxiety and absurdity.
- Each of the robots weighs(opens in a new tab) a massive 140-pounds and costs a whopping $35,000. Oddly, all of the robots are named Marty, and atop their tall frames — which tower over my own 5 foot, 3 inch stature — rests a large pair of google eyes. You know, so as not to come off as complete faceless, emotionless, lifeless bots. If you’re confused as to what these rolling mechanical columns do, Martys also wear the following description on their bodies like a name tag:
- This store is monitored by Marty for your safety. Marty is an autonomous robot that uses image capturing technology to report spills, debris, and other potential hazards to store employees to improve your shopping experience.
- Essentially, once Marty identifies a hazard using its sensors, it stops in its tracks, changes its signature operating lights from blue to yellow, and repeatedly announces "caution, hazard detected," in English and Spanish. One of several catches to their existence, however, is that the robots don't actually clean anything.
- Marty is advertised as an aisle-sweeping superhero, but it's simply a messenger that shouts about a problem until a more capable human comes and removes whatever the hazard may be. Upon learning this fact, some people, like myself and the woman heard in this video shared by Twitter user @jennlynnjordan(opens in a new tab), are rightfully confused.
- "Oh, I thought it washed the floor," the unimpressed mystery shopper can be heard saying. "Wow... I've got my husband to tell me there's a mess!” she continued, delivering a burn to both Marty and her semi-helpful hubby. As Jessica McKenzie reports for the New Food Economy(opens in a new tab), employees aren't the biggest fans of the machines either.
- “It’s really not doing much of anything besides getting in the way,” an employee told McKenzie. And in some cases, the machines even create more work.
- A January press release(opens in a new tab) states that the in-store robots are supposed to "enable associates to spend more time serving and interfacing with customers," but one of the robot’s major flaws that its sensors appear to treat each hazard with the same level of caution. A harmless bottle cap or errant piece of cilantro will elicit the same response as a spill of clear liquid that someone could genuinely slip and injure themselves on, which means that in certain cases an employee may have to take time that could be spent interacting with a customer to walk across the store and grab a puny little grape that escaped a bag. Seems counterproductive!
- I've only seen Marty "go off" once in the produce section. When an employee came to the rescue she couldn't seem to find the hazard, so in attempt to quiet the robot she scanned the floor and began picking up any fragment in sight — a questionable crumb, a plastic bread tag, a shred of corn husk. To this day I have no idea what minuscule object Marty was trying to warn me about, but after causing quite the scene it eventually resumed floor duty.
- When Marty isn't getting all hot and bothered about an abandoned twist tie on the floor, you can find the robot beeping incessantly and lurking behind customers' backs.
- Some shoppers — especially those with children — find the robots charming. Nancy Lesslie, who frequents a Stop & Shop in Quincy, Massachusetts, told(opens in a new tab) the Boston Globe, "I talk to him [Marty] I take videos of him. I show them to my kids... he just makes me smile."
- Others, however, find Marty's unfamiliar presence a bit unsettling.
- On one shopping trip while I was browsing a shelf filled with bags of quinoa, I realized that the possibility of Marty choosing my aisle to turn down filled me with genuine anxiety. As Marty's beeps grew louder and closer I literally held my breath and prepared to speed-walk away if necessary to avoid an encounter. After seeing Marty roll past my aisle I triumphantly thought, "That's right. Keep rolling."
- Remember that one debate in October 2016 when Trump was shadowing Hillary Clinton like a magnetic ghost? That's how I feel whenever Marty is around. The googly eyes soften the machine's appearance for a few seconds, but once you break off the staring contest you're reminded that you're in the presence of a rolling piece of tech that uses laser sensing and cameras.
- Ultimately, these robots feel more like a burden than a benefit. They're way too large, way too beep-y, way too pricey, and they seem to create additional tedious work for employees.
- You're telling me Marty has to be this huge? We're the same humans that created the Roomba, and yeah, it sometimes runs over dog poop and makes a mess, but at least it's small and capable of cleaning.
- And is it really worth investing $35,000 in a mostly useless machine when Stop & Shop has reportedly(opens in a new tab) cut back on staffing and made money problems clear to employees?
- The robots did have one perk, though. They actually increased human interaction and led me to interact with employees and fellow shoppers more than usual. Nothing more unifying than a couple of humans chatting over shared robot confusion. As time passes and we further acquaint ourselves with Marty's presence, though, that conversation will die down.
- While Stop & Shop's tech innovations have made headlines recently, they aren't the only stores to test out robots. Westfield malls in California introduced Pepper, a cute 4-foot-tall humanoid robot, in 2016, and even Walmart plans to bring thousands of autonomous floor scrubbers(opens in a new tab) to stores next year.
- In June, Stop & Shop began bringing Marty to stores in New York(opens in a new tab), and by the end of the year(opens in a new tab), 500 of the robots will be in Stop & Shop stores and Giant food stores(opens in a new tab) — another supermarket chain owned by the Netherlands-based parent company, Ahold Delhaize.
- Perhaps if I wasn't so paranoid of technology and didn't live through billions of email addresses getting hacked, millions of Facebook users being impacted by security breaches, rumors that Amazon Echo devices are spying on us, and more I would be more accepting of Marty. But for now, I just want to shop for groceries in peace.

- The pandemic has pitted Stop & Shop employees against a 140-pound hunk of plastic and metal with googly eyes
- by Nicole Gallucci(opens in a new tab)
- Grocery shopping in 2020 is an emotional roller coaster.
- After strapping on your mask and thoroughly sanitizing your cart, you plot out the quickest, most efficient way to navigate the store, grab your items, and get out. Every surface looms like a germ-covered threat, you hold your breath when people pass, and you go to great lengths to ensure you don't get too close to fellow shoppers — exchanging pointed, disapproving glances the second someone disregards the one-way aisle arrow.
- No matter how careful you are, maintaining distance from your fellow shoppers isn't always possible. And an incessantly beeping 140-pound hunk of plastic and metal with googly eyes hovering by your side and blocking the aisles certainly doesn't make things easier.
- The coronavirus pandemic has proven unequivocally that human grocery workers are essential, but it's also made it plainly clear that Marty the grocery store robot(opens in a new tab) is the opposite of essential.

- Marty was introduced by Ahold Delhaize, Stop & Shop's Netherlands-based parent company. They put these robots, which cost a whopping $35,000 each, in hundreds of Stop & Shops and other stores (opens in a new tab)throughout the U.S. in 2019. The robots have been a source of problems since their arrival(opens in a new tab), but as the pandemic has reshaped the shopping experience complaints that Marty prevents proper social distancing(opens in a new tab) have started to pop up.
- When states began issuing stay-at-home orders in March, panicked shoppers flooded stores to stock up on supplies. The robots were initially pulled off the floors to prioritize customer safety, but then gradually reintroduced over the next two months. Though all robots have been fully operational since late May, customers and workers alike feel that Marty has been, at best, completely useless during the pandemic or, at worst, has made shopping and working significantly harder.
- Stop & Shop has marketed the robots as in-store safety devices. (They're meant to detect and report hazards on the floor, but they can't actually remove them.) So if an autonomous robot can't help shoppers or frontline workers in the middle of a crisis, what’s the point?
- As grocery workers continue to fight for hazard pay and risk coronavirus exposure on the job, they're calling on their company and their customers to recognize that human contributions in this pandemic have far outweighed the contributions of grocery store robots like Marty.
- Marty robots were rolled out last year after Stop & Shop cut back on staffing and made their financial problems clear(opens in a new tab). This led workers to fear future tech-related job elimination. While some tech-dazzled adults and impressionable children do find Marty fascinating or charming, shoppers and employees have largely come to see the robot as more of a problem than a problem solver.
- 
- "He's a pain in the ass," said Don, a Stop & Shop employee who's been with the company for more than 30 years. (Don asked to withhold his last name for privacy reasons.) "That's not my perspective, it's everybody for the most part. Customers cannot stand him. He's always in the way… I even hear managers complaining about what a pain in the neck it is, but they have to play along. They have no choice."
- Joe, who's also been working at Stop & Shop for more than 30 years, told Mashable that sometimes the robot even has trouble doing his one extremely simple job. (Joe also asked to withhold his last name for privacy concerns.)
- "We had a shopper pick up a thing of sugar. And the bag had a hole in it so the sugar got all over the floor, but you can't see it. Marty walked right through it and never said a word. A customer pointed it out to us," Joe explained. "You know how slippery [sugar] is on those wax floors?"
- Joe noted that although Marty misses major hazards, the robot will occasionally summon workers to remove extremely small, inconsequential threats, such as a marker, an errant bit of produce, or a twist tie.
- "The sugar was something that was definitely a real hazard — somebody could have gotten hurt badly. And he walked right through it," Joe said. "That just goes to show you that they're full of bologna."

- Whenever workers see Marty, they're reminded of how heavily invested Stop & Shop is in these pieces of useless technology that have done nothing but create more work on the floor and make customers feel unsafe during this global health crisis. It's hard for employees to forget the substantial amount of money the company dropped to deploy hundreds of robots — money that could have been used to pay human beings. Going forward, they want to ensure that Stop & Shop puts people first always, not just during a pandemic.
- The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) — the labor union that represents 1.3 million workers, including more than 900,000 grocery workers at chains like Stop & Shop, Giant Food Stores, and Ralphs — knows that not all technology is bad for workplaces(opens in a new tab), but the general fear that robots can signal an intention to replace workers is extremely justified. Amazon's move towards cashierless self-checkouts(opens in a new tab) is just one example of how companies can use tech to phase out jobs that once belonged to human employees. Union reps and grocery store workers have seen the ways in which artificial intelligence, automation, robots, and other smart technology can negatively impact human jobs, and though they're open to future tech rollouts, they'd like a say in the decisions and the power to protect themselves from tech-related job elimination down the line.
- 
- 
- Workers never considered Marty to be much of a help on regular workdays. After the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and states started to lock down(opens in a new tab), however,  the robots were taken off the floor entirely — docked in their charging stations, and silently classified as non-essential workers.
- "They put him in his corner," Don explained. "It was definitely a good two months before we ever saw Marty again."
- Maura O'Brien, a spokeswoman for Stop & Shop, confirmed that Marty was temporarily sidelined. "When Stop & Shop stores began to see unprecedented customer traffic in March and April, Marty's operation was put on pause temporarily," O'Brien said in a statement to Mashable. "During that pause, changes in our stores were made in response to COVID-19 to help keep our associates and customers safe, including the closure of certain self-service departments and common areas and the institution of one-way aisles."

- While Marty was off the floor, Stop & Shop's human workers were expected to carry out business as usual. Millions of grocery store employees like Don — who never imagined they'd have to put their lives on the line at their jobs — were told that they, like medical professionals and first responders, were essential workers. So they cautiously reported to stores while restaurants, bars, movie theaters, salons, and a variety of other businesses closed their doors until public gatherings were deemed safe again.
- Over the past nine months, Stop & Shop has developed and implemented a series of COVID-19 safety protocols(opens in a new tab) designed to protect workers and customers in stores. In addition to instituting one-way aisles to promote social distancing, stores have installed plastic barriers at service counters and cash registers, ramped up cleaning procedures, and provided workers with PPE, including gloves, face masks, and face shields.
- "Ensuring that our associates continue to have the necessary tools to protect themselves and our customers has remained a top priority for Stop & Shop," O'Brien assured Mashable. But in the early days of the pandemic, grocery store employees were terrified to go to work.
- As March progressed, COVID-19 cases continued to rise in the United States and experts struggled to understand the virus. Unsure of how long lockdowns would last, panicked shoppers started flooding stores to stock up on supplies like bread, milk, eggs, toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and cleaning products. Stores were placing limits on items but still getting wiped out of goods, and the more people shopped the more workers feared for their safety.

- Michele, who has worked at Stop & Shop for 10 years, was extremely worried in the six weeks after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Michele, who asked to go by a different name for privacy concerns, explained that though her Connecticut store didn't have face masks in the early days, workers were given face shields and gloves. But the supplies didn't quell her fear.
- "It was crazy because you just didn't know. You heard of so many people getting sick, and I have my daughter and my grandkids. I just worried about everybody. And myself too, because I have a compromised immune system," she said.
- Many employees, including Don, were grateful to be working and earning a paycheck while millions of other people were out of work(opens in a new tab). But the relief over job stability didn’t take away from personal safety concerns.
- "It was kind of mixed emotions at the beginning. It's obviously nerve wracking, because you're afraid. You're going to work every day thinking, 'Is this the day I'm gonna get it? Is tomorrow the day I'm gonna get it? Am I gonna get it?'" he said.
- 
- 
- 
- While Stop & Shop negotiated in good faith, workers fear the company might have been less generous with hazard pay had it not been for their big 11-day strike in 2019(opens in a new tab). After approximately 31,000 Stop & Shop workers protested at more than 240 New England stores, they received overwhelming support from shoppers and political leaders. Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, all backed the cause, and Vice President Joe Biden, even spoke at a rally in Dorchester, Massachusetts, on April 18. A new contract was ratified in May 2019(opens in a new tab), which awarded union employees better benefits, but if the pandemic had happened before winning these provisions working conditions might be even grimmer today.
-

- "Let's face it, the increased business and profits that the company is realizing because of this pandemic? They're loving it," Don, who's on the executive board of his local union and has been a steward for 21 years, said. "So I wonder how that would have played into negotiations?"
- "I'm glad it happened this way and not the other way around. If the pandemic happened first and then this we would have been in big trouble," Michele, who was on the negotiating committee at the time of the strike, said.
- Though workers are grateful for the hazard pay, they believe they shouldn't have to beg for extensions. They know that Stop & Shop needs them to keep working, and they feel the extra money should continue as long as the pandemic puts their lives in danger.
- "This thing is not over," Joe said. "We are still going into work every day, doing our job, taking chances, because there are hundreds of people coming through the store every day. That pay is just a little assurance that they realize what we're doing. We are keeping them together. Without us they're in serious trouble."
- Joe is right. Coronavirus cases are spiking in the United States(opens in a new tab) again. The New York Times reports that related deaths are increasing — with an average of more than 1,200 deaths per day as updated on Nov. 20. As we approach the holidays and people pack stores and plan celebrations, those numbers are also expected to rise.
- 
- 
- Nine months into the pandemic, grocery workers have never been more confident in their worth.
- The fact that management docked Marty at the first sign of trouble spoke volumes to workers, as did the complaints that started rolling in as soon as the robot returned to floors. As far as workers are concerned, the pandemic proved what they long knew to be true: Marty is verifiably irrelevant.
- As grocery workers continue to put their lives on the line to show up for the job, they're more determined than ever to fight for a better workplace. They want the company to value and invest in humans. They don't want them dropping obscene amounts of money on a giant fleet of useless robots or throwing elaborate birthday parties for those robots(opens in a new tab) — who, of course, lack emotions and are incapable of internalizing praise. The company claims to value their employees, but that assertion falls flat when they continue to ignore their workforce's complaints about the technology that workers fear was created, in part, to replace them.
- When asked if Stop & Shop believes the contributions of human workers have outweighed those of Marty during the pandemic, the company took a clear stance.
- "There is no question that the efforts of our associates during the COVID-19 pandemic have far outweighed any technology we rely on in our stores," O'Brien said. "Their efforts to serve our communities were extraordinary, and we are incredibly proud of what they accomplished during an unprecedented time in our company’s history. We continue to prioritize their health and safety — and to implement extensive measures to help ensure all our stores and facilities are safe."
- O'Brien also explained that Stop & Shop has invested more than $110 million during the pandemic "in increased pay, extended healthcare and leave benefits, access to PPE and other measures to recognize the efforts of our store associates and to help keep them safe."
- But when asked about complaints related to the robot's inability to social distance(opens in a new tab), Stop & Shop defended the technology. Though employees stress that Marty is useless and creates additional work, the company insists these robots keep stores safer for customers and prevent workers from having to walk the floors to check for hazards.
- The spokeswoman did note that "Facilitating social distancing among customers remains a high priority as we head into the busy holiday season," explaining that Marty has been programmed with new store "maps" to help him better navigate the aisles. However, she also revealed that Stop & Shop is considering docking Marty in select locations ahead of Thanksgiving, which, again, signals that the company is well aware the robot gets in the way, even if they won't publicly admit it.

- Stop & Shop's messaging remains mixed, but as workers reflect on the tremendous efforts and sacrifices they've made in the past nine months, they're calling on the company to side with the essential human workers.
- "Things are still not normal," Joe said when asked what he'd like Stop & Shop to know. "Put Marty to bed. I mean, really. The only thing he does is get in the way, and he forces customers to move and get in your way. They can't social distance."
- When asked if she feels Marty has been an essential worker during the pandemic, Michele said "no" three times before laughing and letting out a firm, "Oh, definitely no."
- "Oh, god no,' Don said when asked the same question. "Obviously the company proved their own point. They said he was non-essential by parking him for two months. They themselves were admitting that he would be in the way with the increased buying from people in the stores."
- "We got up every day during this pandemic and took care of customers and risked our lives and our safety," Joe said. "What did Marty do? What did Marty do for the company? Nothing."
- "What? Go around the store looking for a spill?"

- Attention shoppers: I've seen the future of grocery store technology, and let me tell you, we can do better.
- I’m no Marty McFly. I simply reside in a small Connecticut town, which means that in addition to doing Extremely New England things like commuting to the city on the Metro North, bragging about beaches, and the fact that the state inspired the picturesque fictional town(opens in a new tab) in Gilmore Girls, I occasionally spend some time on the weekends shopping for groceries at a local Stop & Shop.
- Prior to 2019, the Stop & Shop shopping experience was similar to that offered by most any other large grocery store chain. But this year, Stop & Shop introduced giant, gray, aisle-patrolling robots at more than 200 stores(opens in a new tab) in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Jersey.
- Now, food shopping comes with unprecedented levels of anxiety and absurdity.
- Each of the robots weighs(opens in a new tab) a massive 140-pounds and costs a whopping $35,000. Oddly, all of the robots are named Marty, and atop their tall frames — which tower over my own 5 foot, 3 inch stature — rests a large pair of google eyes. You know, so as not to come off as complete faceless, emotionless, lifeless bots. If you’re confused as to what these rolling mechanical columns do, Martys also wear the following description on their bodies like a name tag:
- This store is monitored by Marty for your safety. Marty is an autonomous robot that uses image capturing technology to report spills, debris, and other potential hazards to store employees to improve your shopping experience.
- Essentially, once Marty identifies a hazard using its sensors, it stops in its tracks, changes its signature operating lights from blue to yellow, and repeatedly announces "caution, hazard detected," in English and Spanish. One of several catches to their existence, however, is that the robots don't actually clean anything.
- Marty is advertised as an aisle-sweeping superhero, but it's simply a messenger that shouts about a problem until a more capable human comes and removes whatever the hazard may be. Upon learning this fact, some people, like myself and the woman heard in this video shared by Twitter user @jennlynnjordan(opens in a new tab), are rightfully confused.
- "Oh, I thought it washed the floor," the unimpressed mystery shopper can be heard saying. "Wow... I've got my husband to tell me there's a mess!” she continued, delivering a burn to both Marty and her semi-helpful hubby. As Jessica McKenzie reports for the New Food Economy(opens in a new tab), employees aren't the biggest fans of the machines either.
- “It’s really not doing much of anything besides getting in the way,” an employee told McKenzie. And in some cases, the machines even create more work.
- A January press release(opens in a new tab) states that the in-store robots are supposed to "enable associates to spend more time serving and interfacing with customers," but one of the robot’s major flaws that its sensors appear to treat each hazard with the same level of caution. A harmless bottle cap or errant piece of cilantro will elicit the same response as a spill of clear liquid that someone could genuinely slip and injure themselves on, which means that in certain cases an employee may have to take time that could be spent interacting with a customer to walk across the store and grab a puny little grape that escaped a bag. Seems counterproductive!
- I've only seen Marty "go off" once in the produce section. When an employee came to the rescue she couldn't seem to find the hazard, so in attempt to quiet the robot she scanned the floor and began picking up any fragment in sight — a questionable crumb, a plastic bread tag, a shred of corn husk. To this day I have no idea what minuscule object Marty was trying to warn me about, but after causing quite the scene it eventually resumed floor duty.
- When Marty isn't getting all hot and bothered about an abandoned twist tie on the floor, you can find the robot beeping incessantly and lurking behind customers' backs.
- Some shoppers — especially those with children — find the robots charming. Nancy Lesslie, who frequents a Stop & Shop in Quincy, Massachusetts, told(opens in a new tab) the Boston Globe, "I talk to him [Marty] I take videos of him. I show them to my kids... he just makes me smile."
- Others, however, find Marty's unfamiliar presence a bit unsettling.
- On one shopping trip while I was browsing a shelf filled with bags of quinoa, I realized that the possibility of Marty choosing my aisle to turn down filled me with genuine anxiety. As Marty's beeps grew louder and closer I literally held my breath and prepared to speed-walk away if necessary to avoid an encounter. After seeing Marty roll past my aisle I triumphantly thought, "That's right. Keep rolling."
- Remember that one debate in October 2016 when Trump was shadowing Hillary Clinton like a magnetic ghost? That's how I feel whenever Marty is around. The googly eyes soften the machine's appearance for a few seconds, but once you break off the staring contest you're reminded that you're in the presence of a rolling piece of tech that uses laser sensing and cameras.
- Ultimately, these robots feel more like a burden than a benefit. They're way too large, way too beep-y, way too pricey, and they seem to create additional tedious work for employees.
- You're telling me Marty has to be this huge? We're the same humans that created the Roomba, and yeah, it sometimes runs over dog poop and makes a mess, but at least it's small and capable of cleaning.
- And is it really worth investing $35,000 in a mostly useless machine when Stop & Shop has reportedly(opens in a new tab) cut back on staffing and made money problems clear to employees?
- The robots did have one perk, though. They actually increased human interaction and led me to interact with employees and fellow shoppers more than usual. Nothing more unifying than a couple of humans chatting over shared robot confusion. As time passes and we further acquaint ourselves with Marty's presence, though, that conversation will die down.
- While Stop & Shop's tech innovations have made headlines recently, they aren't the only stores to test out robots. Westfield malls in California introduced Pepper, a cute 4-foot-tall humanoid robot, in 2016, and even Walmart plans to bring thousands of autonomous floor scrubbers(opens in a new tab) to stores next year.
- In June, Stop & Shop began bringing Marty to stores in New York(opens in a new tab), and by the end of the year(opens in a new tab), 500 of the robots will be in Stop & Shop stores and Giant food stores(opens in a new tab) — another supermarket chain owned by the Netherlands-based parent company, Ahold Delhaize.
- Perhaps if I wasn't so paranoid of technology and didn't live through billions of email addresses getting hacked, millions of Facebook users being impacted by security breaches, rumors that Amazon Echo devices are spying on us, and more I would be more accepting of Marty. But for now, I just want to shop for groceries in peace.

- Stop & Shop workers ratified a new contract after beating back a raft of concessions with an 11-day strike. Photo: UFCW 1459.
- Thirty-one thousand workers at New England grocery giant Stop & Shop struck for 11 days in April, beating back concessions with a display of power that took management by surprise.
- Members of five Food and Commercial Workers locals in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut walked out April 11 over company proposals to hike health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs, kick 1,000 spouses off the company’s health plan, get rid of time-and-a-half on Sundays, and gut workers’ pensions.
- “The company was out to bust us,” said Jeff Jones, vice president of UFCW Local 1459. “They didn’t think we were credible. They didn’t think we had the internal organizing. They didn’t think we’d have the public support.
- “I think they thought we were bluffing, and they were going to call the bluff.”
- “Who runs this store? We run this store!” was the chant on the picket line one day in Holyoke, Massachusetts, a town once known for its paper mills. Strikers walked in long circles in front of their store’s loading dock, stopping a bread delivery.
- Teamster drivers respected picket lines and refused to make deliveries throughout the strike, leaving shelves unstocked and perishables dumpster-bound. Photos from inside some of the 240 struck stores showed moldy bread sitting out on shelves. Essential items like water and vegetables were not to be found.
- “Marty the Robot,” recently rolled out by Stop & Shop to alert employees to which aisles need cleaning, was left to wander the aisles alone, with few customers to scare or workers to annoy. (Marty is “like a Roomba who can’t clean,” said Kim Terranova, a worker at the Northampton, Massachusetts store.)
- Strikers reported that even customers who crossed the picket lines would often come out minutes later, empty-handed.
- On Easter Sunday, the parking lot at the Northampton store sat empty—and not because the store was closed. Union member Lori McSheffrey, a front-end manager who has worked at Stop & Shop for 39 years, said that’s unheard of on this holiday feast weekend.
- “It’s like this at all the stores,” she said.
- The mood on the picket line was friendly. McSheffrey met teachers, nurses, Verizon techs, and transit workers who had come out to support fellow union members.
- Meanwhile at another picket in Hadley, Massachusetts, a customer pulled up to say that she really needed to buy flowers for church, and that she had been a regular at the store for 20 years. The strikers kindly asked her to not cross. She drove off with a wave.
- At the main entrance to that store, a few customers taped up their receipts from other stores to show they had changed their usual shopping habits.
- The strike, which lasted through the traditionally lucrative grocery week of Easter and Passover, cost the company an estimated $90 to $110 million—3 percent of its annual profits.
- “In nearly 30 years, we haven’t seen a strike as effective and devastating as this one,” grocery industry consultant Burt Flickinger told the Boston Globe. He estimated that 90 percent of regular customers took their business elsewhere.
- Stop & Shop used to be known for giving full health benefits to part-timers, something that’s uncommon in the industry. But in 2013 negotiations, the company used the Affordable Care Act as an excuse to eliminate insurance for thousands of part-timers who work fewer than 30 hours a week.
- This year, for those workers who still get health benefits, Stop & Shop wanted to double out-of-pocket expenses and increase weekly premium costs by up to 90 percent. (It also wanted to make part-timers start paying premiums for vision, dental, disability, and life insurance.)
- Give $10 a month or more and get our "Fight the Boss, Build the Union" T-shirt.
- That was one reason for the strike. Another reason: for existing part-timers, who make up 75 percent of the workforce, Stop & Shop was pushing to replace time-and-a-half pay on Sundays and holidays with a set premium that wouldn’t increase as wages increased, and an even lower premium for new hires.
- That would cut into paychecks that are already tight, since hours can fluctuate dramatically. McSheffrey, for instance, is technically part-time. She said she works “35-40 hours and sometimes 50 hours a week—but then they’ll cut me down to 20 hours if they want.”
- Because her hours are so insecure, she said, “I have to work a side job. Most people do.”
- The company also came gunning for the pension, initially proposing to contribute only to 401(k) plans. Heading into the strike, the company had moved off that initial offer, but it was still refusing to increase contributions to fully fund the pension plan, which covers all union members at Stop & Shop, though there are multiple tiers.
- Meanwhile staffing has been on the decline. Jill Subocz has felt the impact over her 38 years working for Stop & Shop in Hadley.
- For a long time she was a front-end manager, responsible for keeping registers staffed and customers happy. But “when the store started making cutbacks on hours and help, I was stressed pretty much 24/7,” she said, “because I would worry about giving good customer service.”
- Subocz demoted herself back to cashier. But these days even working the cash register is stressful, she said, “with the lack of people to call to come up front and help.”
- Did the company need concessions? In a word, no. Stop & Shop’s parent company, Netherlands-based Ahold Delhaize, made $2 billion in profits last year. Over the past two years it has increased shareholder dividends by 11.1 percent, paying out $880 million—all the while claiming that concessions were necessary to stay competitive.
- It was Easter evening when the union claimed victory. The new contract, approved the following week at local union meetings, rebuffed most of the company’s demands.
- Current health insurance benefits, out-of-pocket costs, and deductibles will stay the same, with premium increases of $4-$8 per week. Workers can keep their spouses on their insurance, even if a spouse’s employer offers health benefits.
- Stop & Shop agreed to fully fund the pension, increasing contributions by as much as $35 a month. The agreement does, however, introduce a sixth tier on the pension for new part-timers, who will accrue pension benefits equivalent to just $12.50 per month times their years of service.
- The deal keeps time-and-a-half pay on Sundays for all current employees. New part-timers, however, will receive a lower premium on Sundays, gradually increasing from $1.50 an hour in their first year to $3 an hour in their third year. After three years they will graduate to full time-and-a-half pay.
- In Massachusetts these takebacks reflect a “grand bargain” signed into law last year by Republican Governor Charlie Baker. It mandated a $15 minimum wage with a five-year phase-in, but simultaneously did away with the state law that used to mandate time-and-a-half on Sundays and holidays.
- The union won language that will keep wages a certain level above the minimum wage. Full-time employees will see raises of up to 62.5 cents an hour, while part-time raises range from 25 to 55 cents depending on seniority.
- With strategic timing and broad support, this strike showed how much power workers have.
- But it’s not the last word. Local 1459 VP Jones said the union’s next step should be to develop the new leaders it discovered during the strike and keep them engaged. “This is just the latest saga,” he said. “Three years from now, we need to be even better prepared.”

- #martytherobot is a #servicerobot that alerts customers of spills and trip hazards and checks inventory to detect incorrect pricing or missing labels.
- 
- #didyouknow: #martytherobot uses #embeddedcameras to navigate and avoid customers and store displays.
- Grocery stores can be an overcrowded confusing mess, but a new service robot may help make them safer and cleaner. Next time shoppers visit their local Giant, Martin’s, or Stop & Shop, they may run into a googly-eyed robot named Marty. Throughout 2019, Marty the Robot has been joining 500 supermarkets.
- Marty the Robot is a service robot the same height as the tallest grocery store shelf. He’s a gray, slender, slow-moving device with big, cartoonish eyes. Marty will roam the supermarket and will alert humans to problems that need their attention.
- Marty the Robot dons a sign that reads “Marty is an autonomous robot that uses image capturing technology to report spills, debris, and other potential hazards to store employees to improve your shopping experience.” Marty uses embedded cameras to navigate and avoid customers and store displays. He’s powered by rechargeable lithium batteries.
- When Marty notices spills or other trip hazards, he can alert customers verbally by saying “Caution. Hazard detected.” He can then contact employees through the store’s public announcement system. Marty the Robot can also scan shelves to check products and detect incorrect pricing or missing labels.
- Shoppers don’t need to worry that personal information about them is being collected. Any images or videos Marty captures is stored for a short period of time and is then destroyed. His focus is on identifying spills and price mismatches, not monitoring security.
- Adding Marty the Robot may result in significant cost savings. Employees spend hours per day checking for hazards and checking inventory. The data collected by the service robot can also help stores with operations, inventory management, and scheduling timely delivery of products. Many customers are intrigued by Marty the Robot, taking selfies with him.
- The impact on workers appears to be small since Marty primarily alerts workers to problems. As the technology grows and additional functions are added like stocking shelves, workers may be freed up to perform other tasks, including deploying and maintaining the service robots. Giant’s goal is to free up associates to spend more time serving customers and reduce the risk caused by spilled foods.

- Employees and at Giant Food Stores in the U.S will be introduced to new colleagues this week. The grocery chain announced it is 'hiring' robot in all stores that will monitor the aisles for spills.
- Marty is a tall wheeled robot that can move around and use image capturing technology, to identify spills and other hazards and alert them to staff and shoppers by announcing them on the store public address system.
- The plan to roll out the robots across all stores comes after a pilot program tested Marty in two Pennsylvanian stores last year.
- 
- "Bringing robotics and AI from a research lab to the sales floor has been a very exciting journey, and we were thrilled by the customer response in our pilot stores," Nicholas Bertram, president of Giant Food Stores, said in a statement. Marty is equipped with sensors to help him avoid collisions with shelves or people.
- The googly-eyed robot should allow humans to spend more time with customers. Giant Food Stores states the introduction of the robots isn’t meant to replace human workers but rather complement them. The robots should be rolled out across all stores by the middle of the year.
- In addition to spotting spill, Marty can scan shelves for out of date items. If any are found the robot can generate a report that is sent to appropriate staff. The robot can also check for price discrepancies between ticketed price and barcode price.
- Walmart is also introducing robots to all its stores. A step up from Marty, Walmart's robots will actually be able to clean the floor.
- They are also testing other kinds of robots that can handle repetitive jobs like the shelf and product scanning. Walmart is using robots from robotics company Bossa Nova.
- These smart assistants can perform tasks like identifying when items are out of stock, locating incorrect prices, and detecting wrong or missing labels.
- Interestingly, the employees of Walmart are the biggest advocates for the robots. Instead of seeing them as a threat to jobs, Walmart employees understand the tasks the robots are doing and appreciate the dull and repetitive tasks being allocated away from themselves.
- Surprisingly, human shoppers in stores tend to ignore robots. Expect more and more stores to introduce robotic staff as the technology develops at a rapid pace.
- [see-also]
- Amazon has famously embraced robotic workers inside their warehouses but smarter more responsive robots are likely to show up in more retail settings increasingly. A variety of robotics manufacturers is developing robots that can respond to customers' requests.
- One of these is the Airbot by LG. The elongated bot can provide guidance and advice to customers who approach and can scan boarding passes and provide answers about things such as flight status and location of boarding gates.
- Correction:
- We apologize for our mistake. Giant Food representative sent us more clear information about this article:
- "At this time, there are no plans to bring “Marty” or robotic testing to Giant Food, with our headquarters located in Landover, Maryland. The announcement of “Marty” the robot being set up at Giant is happening only at GIANT FOOD Stores with its headquarters located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, our separate sister company. “Marty” is being deployed at GIANT FOOD Stores to assist store associates in spotting spills and trip hazards and is designed to allow employees to have more time to serve customers. Giant Food of Landover, with locations in Washington, D.C., Maryland, Virginia and Delaware is not currently testing “Marty” or other robotic programs."

- QUINCY — It was just a scrap of paper on the floor of a Stop & Shop supermarket in Quincy, near the produce section. But for Marty, no matter how small the scrap, it was one piece too many. At the sight of it, Marty froze and called for backup.
- Marty is not some teenager working an after-school shift. It is 140 pounds of plastic and metal, with glowing lights atop a towering frame with big cartoon eyes, and cameras and lasers to spot garbage, spills, and other stuff that shouldn’t be in the aisles of a supermarket.
- The $35,000 machine is one of about 500 robots that Stop & Shop’s owner, the Dutch company Ahold Delhaize, has deployed in some of its US grocery stores. And in the process, Ahold is doing its part to normalize robots in public places.

- Thousands of people work with robots in factories or use robotic vacuum cleaners and mops at home to clean their floors.
- But Marty is in the vanguard of an army of machines that will make casual run-ins with robots commonplace in store aisles, on sidewalks, and in other public places.
- Walmart, for example, is deploying hundreds of machines to scrub the floors of its stores and take inventory by scanning the shelves. Companies such as Starship Technologies and Amazon.com are testing robots that roll down sidewalks delivering pizzas and soda pop in Seattle, London, Beijing, and other cities.
- Meanwhile, Agility Robotics of Albany, Ore., recently announced a partnership with Ford Motor Co. on an automated package delivery system that combines a self-driving van with a two-legged walking robot. The van will drive itself to the destination; the robot will pick out the correct package and walk it to the customer’s doorstep. The only humans involved will probably be awestruck spectators.
- Advertisement
- It’s sci-fi movie stuff but here in real life. And no matter how many “Star Wars” films we’ve seen, we’re not ready.
- For instance, the rise of robots may threaten the jobs of millions of workers, such as those who went on strike earlier this year at Marty’s home base, Stop & Shop. Erikka Knuti, communications director for the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union, said her group is all for technological innovation, but she said the company should invest in people first.
- “For $35,000 you can get a worker who can do a lot more than stop and stare at a spill,” said Knuti. “Human beings are still social animals. When people go to the stores, they want customer service.”
- But for Stop & Shop senior vice president Stacy Wiggins, customer service is exactly the reason the company is using Marty. Far from replacing workers, Wiggins said, the robot “frees up the associate to actually take care of customers.”
- In theory, Marty could result in cleaner stores with more attentive clerks, which in turn could attract more shoppers and lead to new hiring. But there’s only one way to find out.
- More robots also might mean less privacy. Machines such as Marty use cameras to find their way around — cameras that could track every visitor to the store. Each Marty robot has a sign saying it “uses image capturing technology to report spills, debris and other potential hazards.” But the sign doesn’t explicitly say that Marty does not take photos of people or will discard such images if captured accidentally.
- Advertisement
- Stop & Shop says it does not photograph customers. The company doesn’t even use Marty’s cameras to check store shelves for inventory tracking.
- Julie Carpenter, a research fellow in the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group situated at California Polytechnic State University, said retailers need to lay out a specific privacy policy as they introduce robots. Otherwise, she warned, “there could be potential pushback — people saying I don’t want to shop there until I know what’s going on.”
- This issue becomes more acute as robots hit the sidewalks. Consider Ford’s planned walking delivery robot. Imagine if it is programmed to photograph all nearby houses, recording the brand of parked cars or the lawn mower used by a neighbor. Advertisers might pay a fortune for such data. But if you’re that neighbor, how do you tell somebody else’s robot to mind its own business?
- “How can you possibly opt in or out of this?” Carpenter asked. “Companies . . . need to anticipate those questions.”
- There’s also the possibility that some humans won’t welcome the constant presence of mobile, intelligent machines. “People seem to have a very strong response, both positive and negative, to robots,” said Guy Hoffman, an assistant professor of engineering at Cornell University. “They’re either these cultural saviors or doomsday devices.”
- But while there have been incidents worldwide when people have attacked robotic security guards and self-driving cars, Hoffman predicts that in the long run, humans will make their peace with the machines.
- Advertisement
- At the Quincy Stop & Shop, shoppers seemed downright indifferent to Marty patrolling the aisles, issuing a soft beep every few seconds to announce its presence. One stepped casually out of its way; others stood pat, trusting the robot to halt and change course, which it always did.
- One shopper, Nancy Lesslie of Quincy, paused to say hello to Marty. It’s become part of her shopping routine. “I talk to him, “ Lesslie said. “I take videos of him. I show them to my kids . . . he just makes me smile.”
- When it detected a scrap of trash, Marty stopped and its head blinked an amber light. A cool female voice chanted, “Caution, hazard detected,” in English and Spanish, and the message was also relayed over the store’s public address system.
- Unlike Walmart’s floor scrubbers, Marty isn’t capable of cleaning up. Instead, it pings a mobile app on an employee’s phone to report the location of the mess. Once the cleanup is complete, the worker touches a button on Marty’s side and the robot resumes its patrol.
- Marty came into being almost by accident. Badger Technologies, the Nicholasville, Ky.,  company that makes the machine, started life as a research project inside Lexmark, the maker of computer printers and digital signs for retail stores.
- When Lexmark executives wanted to help retailers automatically monitor inventory and identify spills and trash, they toyed with a host of ideas, some of them downright bizarre — flying drones over the shelves, or cameras suspended from cables like those used in NFL stadiums.
- Advertisement
- In the end, said Badger chief executive Tim Rowland, they figured a patrolling robot was the easiest way.
- “We didn’t want the retailer to have to build any infrastructure,” said Rowland. A robot “requires nothing from anyone in the store. . . . You basically program them and put them in motion.”
