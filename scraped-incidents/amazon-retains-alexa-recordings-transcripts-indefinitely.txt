- Amazon has publicly confirmed that it keeps text transcripts of voice recordings made by users of its Alexa voice assistant services, even after users delete their voice recordings, enraging covil rights and privacy advocates.
- The confirmation had come to light after Senator Chris Coons had sent a letter (pdf) to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos requesting information on the company’s privacy and data security practices for Alexa devices following reports indicating Amazon was storing and preserving text transcripts of user voice recordings.
- Amazon had responded (pdf) by saying the company indefinitely retains text logs of transcribed audio recordings on its cloud servers, and that users are unable to have them deleted. By contrast, Google and Apple said they do not keep user transcript data indefinitely.
- Amazon had stated (pdf) in a 2019 white paper that Alexa user text data was stored 'for machine learning purposes,' and that it is not deleted until that process has been completed.
- The confirmation comes after lawsuits were filed in Seattle and Los Angeles alleging that Amazon had been recording children using Alexa devices without their consent, even after parents had delete the voice recordings.

- Amazon’s acknowledgment that it saves Alexa voice recordings – even sometimes after consumers manually delete their interaction history – has thrust voice assistant privacy policies into the spotlight once again.
- Amazon has acknowledged that it retains the voice recordings and transcripts of customers’ interactions with its Alexa voice assistant indefinitely. The admission raises questions about how long companies should be able to save highly-personal data collected from voice assistant devices.
- After U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-Del.) demanded Amazon outline its data privacy policies, Amazon in a letter that was publicly disclosed on Tuesday said that consumers have the option to delete their recordings – but even if they do, the company or third-party developers may still save records of customers’ interactions with Alexa.
- “Amazon’s acknowledgement has only left users with further concerns regarding the privacy of their data,” Tim Mackey, principal security strategist, with Synopsys’ Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC), told Threatpost. “That it took an official request from a U.S. Senator to uncover this data retention policy indicates that data collection and retention policies were not readily available to the public… Had Amazon originally disclosed that Alexa retained transcripts of all data processed by the service for an indefinite time, it’s likely that Alexa adoption wouldn’t be what it is today.”
- 
- Amazon said that it keeps data “to provide the Alexa service and improve the customer experience” for its Echo devices. The company also said that it needed to retain certain “records” regardless of whether the audio and transcripts had been deleted by the consumer or not. For instance, if a consumers uses Alexa to request a car from Uber or order a pizza from Domino’s, Amazon or the applicable skill developer would keep a record of that transaction.
- “When a customer deletes a voice recording, we delete the transcripts associated with the customer’s account of both of the customer’s request and Alexa’s response,” according to the letter by Brian Huseman, vice president of Public Policy at Amazon. “We already delete those transcripts from all of Alexa’s primary storage systems, and we have an ongoing effort to ensure those transcripts do not remain in any of Alexa’s other storage systems… However, we may still retain other records of customers’ Alexa interactions, including records of actions Alexa took in response to the customer’s request.”
- The fact that Amazon saves this data is a “clear example” of why data retention is a key component of regulations like General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), Mackey said. For instance, Article 5 of GDPR establishes that data retention should be “for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed,” he said.
- “Clearly an indefinite retention in any form is far longer than is necessary for Alexa to respond to a request for a Skill,” said Mackey. “An example of a more customer centric policy might be if Amazon had only retained transcripts of failed Skills activations for the purposes of improvement for a period not longer than the update cycle for Alexa software. In that case, the policy aligns with customer objectives and has a clear end date.”
- In a tweet, Coons said he was still concerned about data privacy on Echo devices: “Amazon’s response leaves open the possibility that transcripts of user voice interactions with Alexa are not deleted from all of Amazon’s servers, even after a user has deleted the voice recording.”
- I wrote Amazon in May with concerns about the privacy practices for Alexa devices. I’m encouraged that Amazon's response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of and a commitment to protecting users’ personal information. However, I still have concerns.
- — Senator Chris Coons (@ChrisCoons) July 2, 2019

- The level of data being saved and shared by Amazon is heightening concerns about privacy policies when it comes to voice assistant devices – but it’s not just Amazon.
- Google for its part also acknowledged that its saves a history of user voice interactions with Google Home voice assistant devices until consumers choose to delete them – and, like Amazon, may also retain customer interaction data even if that has been manually deleted from the account.
- “When you delete items from My Activity, they are permanently deleted from your Google Account,” according to Google’s privacy policy. “However, Google may keep service-related information about your account, like which Google products you used and when, to prevent spam and abuse and to improve our services. ”
- Neither Google nor Amazon immediately responded to a request for comment from Threatpost.
- Amazon continues to find itself in hot water regarding privacy policies around its Echo devices. In April, Amazon came under fire after a report revealed the company employs thousands of auditors to listen to Echo users’ voice recordings. Last year Amazon inadvertently sent 1,700 audio files containing recordings of Alexa interactions by a customer to a random person –and later characterized it as a “mishap” that came down to one employee’s mistake.

- If you (like so many of us) hate listening to recordings of your own voice, you may be in for an unpleasant future, as Amazon has confirmed it hangs on to every conversation you've ever had with an Alexa-enabled device until or unless you specifically delete them.
- That confirmation comes as a response to a list of questions Sen. Chris Coons (D-Delaware) sent to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in May expressing "concerns" about how Amazon uses and retains customers' Alexa voice assistant data.
- Amazon's response to Coons, as first reported by CNET, confirms that the company keeps your data as long as it wants unless you deliberately specify otherwise.
- "We retain customers' voice recordings and transcripts until the customer chooses to delete them," Amazon said—but even then there are exceptions.
- Amazon, as well as third parties that deploy "skills" on the Alexa platform, keep records of interactions customers have with Alexa, the company said. If, for example, you order a pizza, purchase digital content, summon a car from a ride-hailing service, or place an Amazon order, "Amazon and/or the applicable skill developer obviously need to keep a record of the transaction," Amazon said, without clarifying the specific kind of data that's in that record.
- Other types of Alexa requests, such as setting an alarm, reminder, or calendar event, also leave data, Amazon said. "Customers would not want or expect deletion of the voice recording to delete the underlying data or prevent Alexa from performing the requested task."
- If you would like to review and delete any Alexa voice or transcript data in your Amazon account, you can do so under the Alexa Privacy section, found under "Change your digital and device settings" in the "Your Devices and Content" section of your account.
- Coons said in a statement that he appreciated Amazon's response, but the senator found it left unclear "the extent to which this data is shared with third parties, and how those third parties use and control that information."
- Amazon has found itself in regulators' and lawmakers sights frequently this year, along with several of its other "Big Tech" counterparts. The company admitted in April that human employees listened to a "small sample" of Alexa audio recordings to transcribe and annotate to help improve the software, one of several reports that led Coons to issue his request for information to Amazon.
- The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice, which between them handle competition and antitrust matters, reportedly decided on a divide-and-conquer approach to an investigation in June. According to reports at the time, the FTC would take the lead on investigations into Amazon and Facebook, and the DOJ would look into Apple and Google.
- A day later, the House Judiciary Committee announced a bipartisan investigation into competition regulation and business behavior in digital markets, including Amazon.

- A US senator asked questions, and Amazon provided answers you might not want to hear.
- In a letter to Sen. Chris Coons, Amazon explains who can hold onto records of your conversations with Alexa.
- If you have hangups about Amazon and privacy on its smart assistant, Alexa, you're not alone. Even after Amazon sent answers to a US senator who had questions about how the tech giant retains voice data and transcripts, the lawmaker remains concerned about Alexa's privacy practices.
- Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, sent a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in May, demanding answers on Alexa and how long it kept voice recordings and transcripts, as well as what the data gets used for. The letter came after CNET's report that Amazon kept transcripts of interactions with Alexa, even after people deleted the voice recordings.
- The deadline for answers was June 30, and Amazon's vice president of public policy, Brian Huseman, sent a response on June 28. In the letter, Huseman tells Coons that Amazon keeps transcripts and voice recordings indefinitely, and only removes them if they're manually deleted by users.
- Huseman also noted that Amazon had an "ongoing effort to ensure those transcripts do not remain in any of Alexa's other storage systems." But there are still records from some conversations with Alexa that Amazon won't delete, even if people remove the audio, the letter revealed.
- Privacy concerns aren't just limited to voice assistants, not with smart technology finding its way into more household items like doorbells and locks. And tech companies aren't always up front about what kind of data they collect or how much control you have over it.
- "The American people deserve to understand how their personal data is being used by tech companies, and I will continue to work with both consumers and companies to identify how to best protect Americans' personal information," Coons said in a statement.
- When reached for comment, Amazon referred to the letter for details.
- In the letter to Coons, Amazon noted that for Alexa requests that involve a transaction, like ordering a pizza or hailing a rideshare, Amazon and the skill's developers can keep a record of that transaction. That means that there's a record of nearly every purchase you make on Amazon's Alexa, which can be considered personal information.
- Other requests, including setting reminders and alarms, would also remain saved, Huseman noted, saying that this was a feature customers wanted.
- "Customers would not want or expect deletion of the voice recording to delete the underlying data or prevent Alexa from performing the requested task," Huseman said in his letter.
- That feature raised concerns among privacy advocacy groups, which discovered that Alexa's "Remember" feature didn't delete information stored unless people called Amazon's customer service to delete the entire profile. Amazon said it's since fixed the issue and called it a bug.
- The answers didn't exactly inspire confidence in Amazon for Coons.
- "Amazon's response leaves open the possibility that transcripts of user voice interactions with Alexa are not deleted from all of Amazon's servers, even after a user has deleted a recording of his or her voice," the lawmaker said in a statement. "What's more, the extent to which this data is shared with third parties, and how those third parties use and control that information, is still unclear."
- Amazon said it uses the transcripts for training its voice assistant, and also so customers can know what Alexa thought it heard for voice commands. Those transcripts aren't anonymized --  Amazon explained that they're associated with every user's account.

- You can delete voice recordings so Amazon can't listen to your conversations with Alexa anymore, but text records are a different story.
- While you can delete voice recordings for Amazon, the text records stay.
- Amazon doesn't need to hear your voice recordings to know what you've said. It can read them.
- After Alexa hears its wake word -- which can vary from "Echo" to "Alexa" to "computer" -- the smart assistant starts listening and transcribes everything it hears. That's why when you check your Alexa dialogue history, you can see text next to the recordings like "How's the Weather" and "Set an Alarm."
- Amazon lets you delete those voice recordings, giving you a false sense of privacy. But the company still has that data, just not as a sound bite. It keeps the text logs of the transcribed audio on its cloud servers, with no option for you to delete them.
- Amazon said it erases the text transcripts from Alexa's "main system," but is working on removing them from other areas where the data can travel.
- "When a customer deletes a voice recording, we also delete the corresponding text transcript associated with their account from our main Alexa systems and many subsystems, and have work underway to delete it from remaining subsystems," an Amazon spokesperson said in an email.
- The new finding comes as privacy concerns have reached a boiling point, with people scrutinizing the tech they use more than ever. People want privacy from tech giants, and are finding that the options companies offer are not really doing the trick. In April, Facebook admitted it still tracked people after they deactivated their accounts.
- "Here's what I tell all of our business executives and consumers: 'Delete' is never really 'delete,'" said Theresa Payton, a former White House chief information officer and founder of cybersecurity company Fortalice. "Delete just means that you can't see it anymore."
- On Thursday, a group of 19 consumer and public health advocates filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission claiming that the Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition was retaining children's data even after parents deleted the voice recordings. The data stored on Alexa's "Remember" feature wasn't deleted until the parents called customer service to delete the entire profile.
- "Amazon markets Echo Dot Kids as a device to educate and entertain kids, but the real purpose is to amass a treasure trove of sensitive data that it refuses to relinquish even when directed to by parents," said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.
- In a statement, Amazon said the Echo Dot Kids Edition is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
- While Facebook has drawn much of the attention for the ways it's gobbled up our personal data, Amazon has increasingly inserted itself into our lives. The company has sold more than 100 million Alexa devices, and it's sitting on a massive amount of text data containing details on people's habits and behaviors that isn't deleted. Amazon's smart speakers are also the most popular choice for buyers.
- Amazon Echo dominates the market with about 70% of the market share, while Google Home has about 24% and the Apple HomePod is next at 6%. Google and Apple said they don't keep transcript data indefinitely.
- A Google spokesman said both the audio and text entry is removed when a person deletes that data. For Apple, which uses Siri as a voice assistant, the company said voice recordings are never associated with a person or an account, and are tied to a random identifier that you can delete.
- "When you turn Siri and Dictation off, Apple will delete the User Data associated with your Siri identifier, and the learning process will start all over again," Apple said on its website.
- This retention doesn't just apply to Amazon's own smart speakers -- any third-party device using Alexa as an assistant would be sending that data to Amazon, and people wouldn't be able to delete it. That includes voice data sent to Facebook Portal, a smart speaker released by the social network in November.
- Facebook said it deletes the data and transcribed text for its smart assistant when it's activated through the wake word "Hey Portal." But when it comes to interactions with Alexa on the Portal, that's a different story.
- "Facebook does not have access to interactions with Alexa on Portal," a Facebook spokeswoman said in an email.
- Amazon transcribes your voice data to text through a process it calls Automatic Speech Recognition, which then sends it to another process called the Natural Language Understanding System. The NLU system uses artificial intelligence to figure out what people really mean -- so if you're asking "how is it outside," the system can infer that you mean to ask about the weather.
- In a white paper on Alexa privacy and data handling published in July, Amazon said text data was stored "for machine learning purposes." Amazon doesn't delete that data until the machine learning training is completed. The company didn't clarify how long that process is.
- Amazon also keeps text records when people set reminders -- so even when the voice recording is deleted, Alexa is still able to send reminders to people based on the text record. Your order history through Alexa also remains, even if you delete the voice recording, the company said.
- Beyond the data transcribed from a person's voice commands to Alexa, Amazon also noted that it stored text data on the smart assistant's responses.
- In the same document, Amazon stated: "The response can be used by the Amazon team who built the specific skill to ensure that Alexa is providing relevant answers to queries and that the (Text-to-Speech) system is properly translating the text to speech."
- While it's not your voice or something you've said, it's not hard to figure out what a person asked based on the answer. It doesn't take much to figure out what the question is from a log of Alexa saying "the weather in New York is cloudy this morning."

- Amazon has confirmed that the voice recordings produced by customers of the Amazon Alexa smart assistant are held forever unless users manually remove them.
- Alexa, which is found in products including the Echo smart speaker and Echo Dot, has been the subject of privacy and security concerns in the past -- such as listening in on private conversations and sharing them -- and now, Amazon's confirmation of particular privacy practices may make you think twice about where you keep your Alexa device.
- As reported by sister site CNET, a Democrat Senator, Chris Coons, recently sent a letter to the tech giant requesting answers to how long voice recordings and transcripts were kept.
- With the EU's enforcement of GDPR, a worldwide shift to focus on data collection and privacy, and the imbroglios that companies including Facebook have found themselves in for controversial data practices, the answer may surprise you: Amazon keeps voice interaction records and there is no expiry date.
- In a letter dated June 28, Amazon VP of public policy Brian Huseman told Coons:
- "We retain customers' voice recordings and transcripts until the customer chooses to delete them. [...] When a customer deletes a voice recording, we delete the transcripts associated with the customer's account of both of the customer's request and Alexa's response."
- The company added that there is an "ongoing effort" to "ensure those transcripts do not remain in any of Alexa's other storage systems."
- Unless you know how to remove these recordings manually, Amazon will retain them -- and in some cases, the letter reveals that transcripts will be held even if users remove the audio.

- Amazon says that while the audio copy may be removed, "we may still retain other records of customers' Alexa interactions, including records of actions Alexa took in response to the customer's request."
- In addition, developers of Alexa Skills may also retain the same records -- such as when a pizza is ordered from Domino or a ride request is issued to Uber or Lyft. Purchase records, too, will be recorded -- which is not unreasonable considering these electronic 'receipts' provide proof of purchase.
- Reminders and alarms are also recorded and kept.
- "Customers would not want or expect deletion of the voice recording to delete the underlying data or prevent Alexa from performing the requested task," Huseman said.
- CNET: US Customs and Border Protection reportedly suspends subcontractor over cyberattack
- The recorded information is not anonymized and transcripts are associated with customer accounts. Amazon uses transcripts in order to train both its human employees and natural language processing systems.
- Employees in the US reportedly listen to as many as 1,000 audio clips per day to give context to commands. Amazon also uses transcripts to 'train' Alexa to understand commands which vary depending on factors such as age, environment, speech impairments, and whether or not the user is a native speaker of a language.
- Amazon adds that the transcripts can provide 'transparency" for users about "what Alexa thought it heard and what Alexa provided as a response." When asked for comment, Amazon referred queries to the letter.

- In a statement to CNET, Coons said:
- "Amazon's response leaves open the possibility that transcripts of user voice interactions with Alexa are not deleted from all of Amazon's servers, even after a user has deleted a recording of his or her voice. What's more, the extent to which this data is shared with third parties, and how those third parties use and control that information, is still unclear."

URL: https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/amazon-responds-to-a-u-s-senators-inquiry-confirms-alexa-voice-records-are-kept-indefinitely/
- Amazon has responded to a letter of inquiry it received from U.S. Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) that asks the company to detail what happens to customers’ Alexa voice records and data after they speak to their virtual assistant. The Senator’s letter was prompted by a CNET investigation in May, which found that Amazon keeps voice records unless users manually delete them — and that it may keep text transcripts of those voice recordings indefinitely.
- In Amazon’s response, published today on Senator Coons’ website, the company confirmed CNET’s findings, explaining that it does, in fact, store users’ voice recordings up until the point they choose to manually delete them.
- In other words, the recordings are not automatically deleted at any point.
- However, the original CNET report claimed text transcripts of the voice records were still maintained on Amazon’s servers even after users deleted their recordings, with “no option for you to delete them.” As CNET explained, Amazon would delete the text log from Alexa’s “main system,” but not remaining subsystems.
- In Amazon’s response to the Senator’s inquiry, the company detailed what exactly it stores and what it does not.
- It clarified that transcripts themselves are deleted when a customer chooses to delete a voice recording using the Alexa Privacy Hub dashboard. But, like CNET had claimed, the transcripts are deleted from Alexa’s “primary storage systems.” Amazon isn’t clear about where else they may still reside, saying only that there’s “an ongoing effort” to ensure the transcripts aren’t saved in any other Alexa storage systems.
- Other data may also be retained after voice recordings are deleted, but it’s of less concern.
- “We do not store the audio of Alexa’s response,” Amazon also noted. “However, we may still retain other records of the customers’ Alexa interactions, including records of actions Alexa took in response to the customer’s request,” the company said.
- These records of actions may be retained by either Amazon or a third-party developer when an Alexa skill (voice app) is involved.
- “For example, for many types of Alexa requests — such as when a customer subscribes to Amazon Music Unlimited, places an Amazon Fresh order, requests a car from Uber or Lyft, orders a pizza from Domino’s, or makes an in-skill purchase of premium digital content — Amazon and/or the applicable skill developer obviously need to keep a record of the transaction.”
- This seems practical. After all, if you order an Uber or a pizza, or started a subscription, you’d expect there to be a record of that with the company where the order was placed. And no one really asks their pizza place to wipe their pizza ordering history.
- Amazon also said that for other types of requests — like setting a recurring alarm, asking Alexa to remind you of something, putting a meeting on your calendar or messaging a friend — customers would not expect deletion of the voice recording or the data, nor would they want that, as it could prevent Alexa from performing the task.
- The company explained why it uses transcripts, saying that it helps to train and improve Alexa’s machine learning systems, and to provide a log to customers directly of what they said, what Alexa heard and how the virtual assistant responded.
- Additionally, Amazon confirmed the system stops recording as soon as the customer stops speaking — as indicated by the blue light on the Echo device or, optionally, a tone that can be set to play.
- The company then goes into more technical detail about the short buffer on the device, which is continuously overwritten, and says that Alexa is designed to record and process as little audio from customers as possible as processing audio not intended for Alexa would be costly and of no value to Amazon.
- The original inquiry from the Senator gave Amazon a June 30 deadline, and the response letter was dated June 28.
- Coons today applauded the timeliness of the response, but said there were still questions.
- “I appreciate that Amazon responded promptly to my concerns, and I’m encouraged that their answers demonstrate an understanding of the importance of and a commitment to protecting users’ personal information,” he said, in a statement published to his website.
- “However, Amazon’s response leaves open the possibility that transcripts of user voice interactions with Alexa are not deleted from all of Amazon’s servers, even after a user has deleted a recording of his or her voice. What’s more, the extent to which this data is shared with third parties, and how those third parties use and control that information, is still unclear.  The American people deserve to understand how their personal data is being used by tech companies, and I will continue to work with both consumers and companies to identify how to best protect Americans’ personal information,” he added.

- While many companies retain user data indefinitely, the increased focus on consumer privacy as regulators investigate big tech is starting to drive change. For example, last week Google rolled out a new feature that lets consumers configure their account settings to automatically delete location history on iOS and Android. But this is after years of hoovering up user data, and still requires manual action.
- Still, many would argue that voice assistants should at least offer a similar setting: a way to set voice data to auto-delete, instead of having to remember to do so manually.
- It’s worth pointing out that Amazon is not alone in hoarding user voice data.
- Google also saves voice and audio clips to users’ accounts with an option to review and delete recordings. While saving data is its default, it does allow users to turn voice and audio activity off, if they prefer. Apple, meanwhile, saves Siri voice recordings for six months, then saves a copy of the data in a more anonymized fashion for up to two years longer.
- But more broadly, there are concerns around Amazon’s review process itself and its lack of attention to user privacy.
- As Bloomberg recently found, Amazon workers and contractors during the review process had access to the recordings, as well as an account number, the user’s first name and the device’s serial number. And they were also found to have been sharing audio clips in internal company chat rooms — either to get help with transcribing or to have a laugh at a funny recording.
- In other words, there’s not a culture of privacy at Amazon when it comes to how a company should respect consumer’s private data. That’s different from Apple’s stance these days, where it aims to balance its need for some data retention with consumers’ desire for increased privacy.
- In light of most big tech companies’ inability to properly self-police, there will ultimately be regulations put into place, as these companies insert themselves ever further into our lives. Now, they’re no longer just collecting data as we type into a keyboard or as we move around the world with a phone; they’re in our homes, listening to us and our children as we talk to their systems directly.
- Amazon was asked for further comment regarding Coons’ statement.

URL: https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681423/amazon-alexa-echo-chris-coons-data-transcripts-recording-privacy
- By  Makena Kelly and  Nick Statt
- Amazon has admitted that it doesn’t always delete the stored data that it obtains through voice interactions with the company’s Alexa and Echo devices — even after a user chooses to wipe the audio files from their account. The revelations, outlined explicitly by Amazon in a letter to Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), which was published today and dated June 28th, sheds even more light on the company’s privacy practices with regard to its digital voice assistant.
- The answers are a follow-up to a request from Coons dating to last month when Coons questioned how long the company holds on to voice recordings and transcripts from Echo interactions. In this week’s letter, Amazon confirmed some of the allegations. “We retain customers’ voice recordings and transcripts until the customer chooses to delete them,” the letter reads.
- Amazon doesn’t always delete data gathered using Alexa, even when you tell it to
- Following a CNET investigation published in May, there was also a question about whether Amazon held on to text transcripts of voice interactions with Alexa, even after a user has chosen to delete the audio equivalent. Amazon says some of those transcripts or information gleaned from the transcripts are indeed not removed, both because the company has to scrub the data from various parts of its global data storage systems and because, in some cases, Amazon chooses to hold on to the data without telling the user.
- In its response, Brian Huseman, Amazon’s vice president of public policy, said the company is engaged in an “ongoing effort to ensure those transcripts do not remain in any of Alexa’s other storage systems.” In other words, even if a user manually deletes the audio version, some text versions are still saved in separate storage systems for some unknown amount of time. Yet, in certain cases where Amazon deems the feature set of Alexa would be hindered by deleting data, the company decides to hold on to some version of the data.
- Amazon is claiming it doesn’t hold on to the audio files, but it may hold on to transaction information if someone uses Alexa to call an Uber or place a food delivery order, for instance. “We do not store the audio of Alexa’s response. However, we may still retain other records of customers’ Alexa interactions, including records of actions Alexa took in response to the customer’s request,” Huseman wrote.
- The letter also points out that the company, and even developers of Alexa skills, can keep a record of every transaction or routinely scheduled activity a user makes with an Echo device. This, Amazon says, ensures that the task is easily repeatable and convenient for the user.
- “And for other types of Alexa requests — for instance, setting a recurring alarm, asking Alexa to remind you of your anniversary, placing a meeting on your calendar, sending a message to a friend — customers would not want or expect deletion of the voice recording to delete the underlying data or prevent Alexa from performing the requested task,” Huseman explained.
- Much attention has been paid in recent months to the inner workings of Alexa, following a Bloomberg report in April that outlined how thousands of employees, many of whom are contract workers and some not even directly employed by Amazon, have access to both voice and text transcripts of Alexa interactions that could, in theory, be used to piece together information about a user’s personal life. Amazon claims this data is reviewed and annotated by humans to help improve Alexa over time, using machine learning methods to train the underlying artificial intelligence software.
- Amazon’s Alexa privacy practices are under renewed scrutiny
- But the lack of clarity around how and to what end Amazon collects and stores this data, and why it’s confusing to get it completely scrubbed from the company’s servers, has brought renewed scrutiny to what Amazon claims are industry-standard practices for companies building AI-dependent tools and services.
- The stakes are only getting higher, as Alexa now handles sensitive patient health information. Amazon has also come under fire from child and privacy advocacy groups that claim that the company is violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting and storing data on children under the age of 13 with its Amazon Echo Dot Kids devices.
- “Amazon’s response leaves open the possibility that transcripts of user voice interactions with Alexa are not deleted from all of Amazon’s servers, even after a user has deleted a recording of his or her voice,” Coon said in a statement. “The American people deserve to understand how their personal data is being used by tech companies, and I will continue to work with both consumers and companies to identify how to best protect Americans’ personal information.”

- You can delete voice recordings so Amazon can't listen to your conversations with Alexa anymore, but text records are a different story.
- While you can delete voice recordings for Amazon, the text records stay.
- Amazon doesn't need to hear your voice recordings to know what you've said. It can read them.
- After Alexa hears its wake word -- which can vary from "Echo" to "Alexa" to "computer" -- the smart assistant starts listening and transcribes everything it hears. That's why when you check your Alexa dialogue history, you can see text next to the recordings like "How's the Weather" and "Set an Alarm."
- Amazon lets you delete those voice recordings, giving you a false sense of privacy. But the company still has that data, just not as a sound bite. It keeps the text logs of the transcribed audio on its cloud servers, with no option for you to delete them.
- Amazon said it erases the text transcripts from Alexa's "main system," but is working on removing them from other areas where the data can travel.
- "When a customer deletes a voice recording, we also delete the corresponding text transcript associated with their account from our main Alexa systems and many subsystems, and have work underway to delete it from remaining subsystems," an Amazon spokesperson said in an email.
- The new finding comes as privacy concerns have reached a boiling point, with people scrutinizing the tech they use more than ever. People want privacy from tech giants, and are finding that the options companies offer are not really doing the trick. In April, Facebook admitted it still tracked people after they deactivated their accounts.
- "Here's what I tell all of our business executives and consumers: 'Delete' is never really 'delete,'" said Theresa Payton, a former White House chief information officer and founder of cybersecurity company Fortalice. "Delete just means that you can't see it anymore."
- On Thursday, a group of 19 consumer and public health advocates filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission claiming that the Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition was retaining children's data even after parents deleted the voice recordings. The data stored on Alexa's "Remember" feature wasn't deleted until the parents called customer service to delete the entire profile.
- "Amazon markets Echo Dot Kids as a device to educate and entertain kids, but the real purpose is to amass a treasure trove of sensitive data that it refuses to relinquish even when directed to by parents," said Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood.
- In a statement, Amazon said the Echo Dot Kids Edition is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.
- While Facebook has drawn much of the attention for the ways it's gobbled up our personal data, Amazon has increasingly inserted itself into our lives. The company has sold more than 100 million Alexa devices, and it's sitting on a massive amount of text data containing details on people's habits and behaviors that isn't deleted. Amazon's smart speakers are also the most popular choice for buyers.
- Amazon Echo dominates the market with about 70% of the market share, while Google Home has about 24% and the Apple HomePod is next at 6%. Google and Apple said they don't keep transcript data indefinitely.
- A Google spokesman said both the audio and text entry is removed when a person deletes that data. For Apple, which uses Siri as a voice assistant, the company said voice recordings are never associated with a person or an account, and are tied to a random identifier that you can delete.
- "When you turn Siri and Dictation off, Apple will delete the User Data associated with your Siri identifier, and the learning process will start all over again," Apple said on its website.
- This retention doesn't just apply to Amazon's own smart speakers -- any third-party device using Alexa as an assistant would be sending that data to Amazon, and people wouldn't be able to delete it. That includes voice data sent to Facebook Portal, a smart speaker released by the social network in November.
- Facebook said it deletes the data and transcribed text for its smart assistant when it's activated through the wake word "Hey Portal." But when it comes to interactions with Alexa on the Portal, that's a different story.
- "Facebook does not have access to interactions with Alexa on Portal," a Facebook spokeswoman said in an email.
- Amazon transcribes your voice data to text through a process it calls Automatic Speech Recognition, which then sends it to another process called the Natural Language Understanding System. The NLU system uses artificial intelligence to figure out what people really mean -- so if you're asking "how is it outside," the system can infer that you mean to ask about the weather.
- In a white paper on Alexa privacy and data handling published in July, Amazon said text data was stored "for machine learning purposes." Amazon doesn't delete that data until the machine learning training is completed. The company didn't clarify how long that process is.
- Amazon also keeps text records when people set reminders -- so even when the voice recording is deleted, Alexa is still able to send reminders to people based on the text record. Your order history through Alexa also remains, even if you delete the voice recording, the company said.
- Beyond the data transcribed from a person's voice commands to Alexa, Amazon also noted that it stored text data on the smart assistant's responses.
- In the same document, Amazon stated: "The response can be used by the Amazon team who built the specific skill to ensure that Alexa is providing relevant answers to queries and that the (Text-to-Speech) system is properly translating the text to speech."
- While it's not your voice or something you've said, it's not hard to figure out what a person asked based on the answer. It doesn't take much to figure out what the question is from a log of Alexa saying "the weather in New York is cloudy this morning."
