- Bodega AI, a business that sought to automate the sales of non-perishable corner store items through in-office vending machines, caused controversy after one of its -ex-Google founders went on the record to say their intention was to disrupt and replace neighbourhood mom-and-pop corner stores (also known as 'bodegas').
- Bodega AI co-founder Paul McDonald quip to Fast Company that 'centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you,' resulted in an immediate backlash from social media users and bodega/corner store owners.
- Much of the backlash centred on the choice of name, which some regarded as cultural appropriation, marketing hype, and on the sense of community and belonging that traditional corner stores help provide.
- 'Challenging the urban corner store is not and has never been our goal,' McDonald responded in a blog post. Rather, Bodega’s intended to 'bring commerce to places where commerce currently doesn’t exist.'
- Bodega AI was renamed Stockwell shortly after the fracas.

- Bodega, the startup, is not winning many internet fans
- The latest unwanted tech “innovation” aims to make the bodega obsolete, and Twitter is not having it. A startup, boldly called Bodega, has invented a vending machine that would house non-perishable convenience items, which sounds fine. But, the two ex-Google employees behind the concept are positioning it as a replacement for the local corner store, even adopting a cat as the company’s logo, a reference to the cats that live at convenience stores in cities like New York and Los Angeles.
- The app would allow users to unlock the five-foot-wide pantry boxes and cameras with computer vision will register the items taken. The app then automatically charges the credit card on file. Like many startups, the idea seems to be to eliminate the human part of an everyday transaction. Co-founder Paul McDonald is explicit about Bodega’s mission: “The vision here is much bigger than the box itself,” he says in Fast Company. “Eventually, centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you.”
- Although some can see the benefits of a vending machine selling convenience store items (including, for example, standardizing prices), for most of Twitter, the future McDonald describes doesn’t look so rosy. Some say Bodega isn’t just a bad idea, but also offensive. Bodegas are often owned by immigrants and people of color and serve as communal spaces for entire neighborhoods. Eliminating bodegas would not only destroy livelihoods, but also that feeling of community:
- anyway, if a store on the corner isn't convenient enough for you, it ain't convenience keeping you out of the bodega. it's the people.

- Update, 9/13/17, 4:25 p.m: McDonald apologized for any offense caused by the company’s name on Bodega’s blog this afternoon. “Challenging the urban corner store is not and has never been our goal,” he says.

- Twitter’s least-favorite startup has a few fatal flaws
- “You know what this place needs,” I said to myself this morning, as I went into the little store around the corner where I buy my daily coffee, my breakfast sandwiches, my late-night potato chips, and my emergency tampons. “What it needs is less stuff, and to be inside my apartment building, and also to accept Apple Pay.”
- No, of course I didn’t say that. If you’re a living human being in the United States who has ever had a dollar in your pocket, you’ve probably been in a bodega — or, depending on where you live, maybe you call it a corner store, convenience store, deli, packie (short for “package store”), or party store. Maybe it’s attached to a gas station. Maybe it is a gas station. For some reason, former Google employees Paul McDonald and Ashwath Rajan think all of them need to be disrupted.
- A Fast Company story this morning profiled Bodega, the duo’s startup (which has drawn investment from high-profile firms like First Round Capital and Forerunner Ventures, as well as executives at Facebook, Google, and more), which seeks to replace these corner stores with boxes. Specifically, five-foot-wide, wifi-enabled boxes stocked with non-perishable goods, which we can access by downloading an app, and picking up the items we’d like in view of a computer-vision camera which will automatically charge us for our purchase. “Eventually, centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary,” McDonald told Fast Company, “because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you.”
- The backlash was swift. Declaring that you want to replace family-run, neighborhood-oriented storefront retail with computerized protein-bar transaction cubes is not really the fast track to community embrace. There’s a lot to loathe (and a lot to mock) about Bodega, including the name itself, which nods to the immigrant families who often own the stores the startup wants to put out of business. (Thoughtfully, Fast Company asked McDonald about that. He replied, “We did surveys in the Latin American community to understand if they felt the name was a misappropriation of that term or had negative connotations, and 97% said ‘no’.”)
- Fortunately for its critics, and unfortunately for McDonald, Rajan, and their investors, Bodega faces more obstacles than just a morning of high-intensity Twitter loathing. A range of conveniently located, beautifully merchandised kiosks with an easy app-based point of sale and an evolving range of user-calibrated products seems like a nice, attractive idea. But something like that is built on an intensely complex logistical apparatus — and any mention of that sort of thing seems to be missing from McDonald and Rajan’s talking points, which focus mostly on what they call “the last hundred feet.”
- Bodega’s product is, fundamentally, a vending machine. (Well, maybe it’s a mini-bar — open access to product, in fancy places, with a presumed audience that’s affluent and design-minded.) Vending machines are a unique form of commerce, mostly defined by the lack of human interaction at the point of transaction. This kind of unmanned retail operation has a long history (the vending history timeline on the website of NAMA, the National Automatic Merchandising Association, kicks off with Egypt’s Ptolemaic dynasty; it is delightful), with efficiency as its primary appeal. A tiny, self-contained store without an employee saves all sorts of overhead: Less required real estate, lower payroll, shockingly greater likelihood that shoplifters will be crushed to death.
- These efficiencies aren’t gravy, though; they’re essential. They work by way of a simple economy of scale: If you run a few dozen machines (or a few thousand), it becomes possible to buy your products at a discount, to warehouse the products more effectively, and to both fill and repair your vending units in a more streamlined way. These businesses live or die by logistics.
- This is where things seem likely to fall apart for Bodega. Even with their wifi connections and app-connected camera sensors, the units themselves are still just offering consumers a basic model of unmanned commerce — only with smaller, fancier machines to process the transactions. What Bodega does offer as a differentiator are the number of unique products per unit (100, the average vending machine has 20-40), and the promise that the products will not just be tailored to their general environments — protein bars in the gym, tampons in a sorority house — but to their specific users. A promise of “machine learning” will, as Fast Company explains, “constantly reassess the 100 most-needed items in that community.”
- At 100,000 units — the scale McDonald and Rajan envision — that’s ten million items that are active at a time, plus reserve products for restocking, plus new products to introduce as the “machine learning” (I’m sorry, I just can’t) cycles out low performers. Across specialized markets and user-informed preferences, the number of SKUs (industry shorthand for a stocked product, rather than an individual unit of that product) that Bodega would be dealing with would quickly climb into the thousands.
- So many products, across so many Bodegas, in so many unique configurations poses a set of phenomenally complex logistical conundra: How are the products purchased? Where are they warehoused? How are they bundled for distribution to their unique Bodegas? Who restocks the Bodegas? How are the restocks transported? How can the company ensure that there’s sufficient route density — that there are enough Bodegas in each local area, which need to be restocked frequently enough, on harmonious schedules, to cover the costs of labor and transportation?
- Labor is not a minor issue, with a company like this one. “Unmanned retail” isn’t a precisely accurate phrase: There may not be a person ringing up your transaction, but there are plenty of people working to maintain a system that allows that absence — even the famous midcentury automats were just the outward storefront of a working, fully-staffed kitchen. Bodega’s warehouses will need to be staffed. The trucks will need to be driven. The Bodegas themselves will need to be manually restocked — each can, bottle, and box placed one by one onto each unit’s shelves. Many traditional vending machine companies employ restockers who double as machine repairers. Will a Bodega restocker be trained to fix a busted computer-vision camera?
- Critics of Bodega are already comparing the startup to Juicero, the highly investment-valued cold-press-at-home juice company that collapsed spectacularly after its $400 juicing machine was revealed to be a pricey paperweight. It’s not that the machine didn’t squeeze well — it’s that it wasn’t necessary. The fruits and vegetables in Juicero’s pre-mixed packets were already diced so finely that they were, functionally, already juice.
- But I think the better analogy here is Blue Apron. Like Bodega, Blue Apron took something that involved leaving the house and engaging in moderate human interaction — in their case, grocery shopping for dinner — and slickly repackaged it in a way that it seemed actually to be selling a balm for recipe anxiety. Bloomberg’s always very smart Matt Levine called it “a tech company in the sense that its product is not meals, or ingredients, but simulacrum.” The problem was that the simulacrum wasn’t proprietary. As soon as it became clear that there was a demand for meal kits, everybody else got in on the action, too.
- In a market full of clones, imitators, and knockoffs, all Blue Apron had going for it were its early entry advantage, and its skill at packaging and distributing meal kits better than its competitors — but even that wasn’t enough to save it from the ravenous race to the bottom of a newly oversaturated market. After a few years of rapid growth as a private company, Blue Apron went public in July. The data revealed by their S-1 (a formal statement filed to the SEC when a company plans to sell stock in an IPO) raised eyebrows, with numbers pointing to unsettlingly high customer churn and an eye-watering cost of new-customer acquisition. Their Q2 data confirmed these problems, among others, leading to a stock nosedive so severe that you couldn’t short Blue Apron even if you wanted to.
- Even if Bodega does, improbably, slay its logistics dragons, its success will serve mostly to prove to imitators that this is a space worth being in, and it’ll drown.
- In Silicon Valley, Bodega’s success will not be measured by how well it truly replaces the stores it wants to eliminate — by how many lives it makes better, how many jobs it creates, how many communities it strengthens, or how many families it serves. Like most startups, its success will depend on whether its founders and investors make money, either by cashing in with an IPO or selling to a bigger company for a tidy profit. The target is probably the latter, and probably Amazon, with the sales pitch not Bodega’s market positioning or logistics system (ha!), but the actual hardware of its vending devices — a low-footprint storefront that bridges the gap between Amazon’s pickup lockers (non-instantaneous, but zero human interface) and its instant pickup stores (instantaneous, but you have to briefly interact with someone).
- When I joined in on Bodega’s public Twitter flogging (with tweets including several that turned into this article), I got a reply from Nadim Hossain, a startup executive who’s done time at several major Silicon Valley success stories. He wrote, “Appreciate your insights! Curious why Bodega is eliciting such strong negative reactions? If it works, you’ve proven it’s an audacious idea.”
- Inside of that lives a peculiarly Silicon Valley syllogism: Success is heightened by outside skepticism, therefore outside skepticism may be an indicator of success — Hossain later tweeted that he thinks the Bodega idea “has merit.” But I’m more stuck on that word, “audacious.” I think Hossain means it to be about boldness and daring, which are qualities that remain to be seen — if the startup fails, it won’t have been bold and daring, it will have been foolhardy. But I think by another meaning, Bodega is already audacious: It is rash and thoughtless. It’s ethically and culturally bankrupt, but it also seems to be poorly constructed and unsustainably scaled. So it’ll be the other kind of bankrupt, too.
- Update: Bodega co-founder Paul McDonald posted to the company’s blog this afternoon apologizing for any offense caused by their name. McDonald did not mention Bodega’s business model, which remains terrible.

- Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.
- Two former Google workers have started a venture that is threatening to put the local corner store out of business — with a name that’s a slap in the face of struggling shopkeepers.
- The announcement Wednesday of “Bodega,” a glorified vending machine for nonperishable items, left small business owners, their employees and boosters seething.
- “To me it’s like sacrilegious — you wanna take this name and use it to make money off it?” said Frank Garcia, who chairs the state Coalition of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce and whose grandfather headed the Asociacion de Bodegueros trade group in the 1950s and ’60s.
- “My grandfather is rolling in his grave,” he said.
- The machine — a roughly ­8-cubic-foot box with glass doors — is stocked with non-perishable, convenience-store fare. Users can unlock the doors with their phones while a camera watches what they remove and charges them accordingly.
- The company’s logo is a cat silhouette in an apparent reference to the animal’s ubiquity in bodegas.
- Former Google product managers Paul McDonald and Ashwath Rajan cooked up the concept believing it would replace the humble brick-and-mortar bodega, McDonald told magazine Fast Company.
- “Eventually, centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you,” he said.
- The company aims to install more than 1,000 in gyms, lobbies and other public spaces nationwide by the end of 2018.
- But the machines cannot serve the social function that bodegas do, according to Franklin Reyes, 45, who has worked at Manuel’s Grocery on 152nd Street and Broadway since 1989.
- “This is the place that, people after work, they come here talking about baseball, about all kinds of things,” he said. “So if the store disappears, that disappears, too.”
- Bodegas are “the character of the neighborhood,” according to retired NYPD cop and lifelong Washington Heights resident Louis Gonell, who explained that workers are always ready to let customers pay for groceries on credit when money is tight.
- Following social media backlash, McDonald said he spoke to “New Yorkers, branding people, and even [ran] some survey work” to see whether the name was a bad idea.
- “Despite our best intentions and our admiration for traditional bodegas, we clearly hit a nerve this morning,” he wrote in a blog Tuesday. “And we apologize to anyone we’ve offended.”
- In an e-mail exchange, he gave no response when asked whether the company would change its name.

- Last Wednesday, not long after Fast Company sparked tabloid headlines with its profile of a start-up that hoped to install unstaffed pantry boxes in apartments, offices, dorms, and gyms — under the name Bodega — emails started pouring in to Frank Garcia.
- Garcia has represented thousands of bodega owners as chair of the New York State Coalition of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. (He recently became chair of the National Association of Latino State Chambers.) In his interview with Fast Company, he offered harsh words for the Silicon Valley–backed start-up: “To me, it is offensive for people who are not Hispanic to use the name ‘bodega,’ to make a quick buck,” he told the publication. “It’s disrespecting all the mom-and-pop bodega owners that started these businesses in the ’60s and ’70s.”
- Then the messages came, arriving through the Hispanic Chambers of Commerce’s website. “People were angry,” Garcia tells the Voice. “They’re wondering, ‘How can I help?,’ ‘Do you need money?’ ‘Do you need a lawyer?’ Someone emailed me just to say that when they’re coming home late at night, ‘the bodega knows my name, will make me a sandwich, and make sure I get home all right.’ ”
- A Bodega, unlike a bodega, promises to offer customized, nonperishable items in five-foot-wide pantry boxes. A phone app will allow users to unlock the box, and surveillance cameras will register what they’ve picked up, automatically charging their credit cards. Imagine a pantry filled with power bars and Gatorades in a gym, or popcorn, tampons, and makeup remover in a sorority house. This month, the San Francisco–based founders opened 50 Bodega locations on the West Coast, with plans for more than 1,000 locations across the country by 2018.
- With the increasing anxiety over keeping small businesses afloat, the Bodega start-up hit a very sensitive nerve. Bodega co-founder Paul McDonald referred the Voice to this statement on Fast Company’s profile, admitting that “the reaction that we got…certainly wasn’t what we expected,” and insisting that “challenging the urban corner store is not and has never been our goal.” (Fast Company’s headline, “Two Ex-Googlers Want To Make Bodegas And Mom-And-Pop Corner Stores Obsolete,” wasn’t helpful in that regard; neither was McDonald’s statement to the publication that with his product, “centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you.”)
- McDonald’s company notes that actual bodegas offer thousands of items, whereas they’ll provide only eight square feet of retail shelf space to hold fewer than a hundred nonperishable items, but no fresh food.
- It’s a concept that led the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development to dub the concept “Brodega.” (The company’s choice of a “bodega cat” as its logo has come in for particular criticism; Garcia has suggested the possibility of a lawsuit to force a logo change, but declined to go into specifics.) Quenia Abreu, president of the New York Women’s Chamber of Commerce, who also works with bodega owners, says, “We’re honored they wanted to use the name, but if they try to trademark it…we would fight for that, definitely.”
- The history of New York’s beloved corner stores starts with the first generation of arrivals from Puerto Rico in the 1940s and ’50s. Latinx-owned bodegas expanded across the city, many as the sole shopping outlet in neighborhoods underserved by retail and grocers. Ramón Murphy, president of the Bodega Association of the United States, says there are roughly 14,000 bodegas across the city today, with an increasing number owned by Arab Americans.
- For most New York bodega owners, app-driven vending machines are less of a threat than soaring rents, according to Murphy. “That’s the biggest concern on the brain,” he says. “Every time you see a bodega close, there’s only one reason. It’s the rent. Bodegas don’t close for anything…except for a rent problem.” Garcia estimates five to six Hispanic businesses close a day throughout New York, thanks to rising commercial rents caused by widespread gentrification.
- While the city has laws protecting affordable housing, there’s nothing similar to stop landlords from drastically increasing rent on mom-and-pop storefronts. (In 2015, one longtime Boerum Hill bodega facing a rent increase from $4,000 to $10,000 plastered “Artisanal Rent Hike Price Sale” signs on its window, advertising Dickson’s Farms Condoms for $24.97.) The Small Business Jobs Survival Act, a bill that would require landlords to offer multiyear leases and submit to binding arbitration, has been around since the 1980s, and is currently sponsored by a majority of councilmembers. Yet it’s remained stalled, with real estate lobbyists questioning its constitutionality.
- Lena Afridi, policy coordinator for equitable economic development for the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, says that “the language exists when we’re talking about housing and gentrification…but it doesn’t really exist concerning small businesses.” ANHD began small-business anti-displacement work last year, and helped pass the city’s first commercial tenant anti-harassment legislation. The Bodega drama, she says, “was a moment where people — who have seen all these changes in their neighborhood — understood that the bodega is something that’s crucial and part of New Yorkers’ lives. It elicited an immediate response that doesn’t often come from threats to other small businesses.”
- It’s too early to tell whether the idea will take off; a Business Insider article found that in many of the San Francisco locations Bodega was supposedly tested in, the cases were nowhere to be found, though employees at one location with a confirmed Bodega said they were glad to have it since shopping options were few near their office.
- That may play out differently in New York, where actual bodegas are more prevalent than most places in the country. Still, in a competitive real estate market where property developers test a rotation of amenities to woo tenants, Bodega will likely make an appearance by 2018 in a new rental or condo development. (It’s also worth mentioning that Eater editor Helen Rosner has questioned the logistics of stocking customized items in Bodegas across the country, which she calls “an intensely complex logistical apparatus.”)
- “It’s a vending machine! Can you buy a gallon of  milk in there?” asks Abreu. “People like to go into bodegas, people want to have a conversation, they want to have an interaction.”
- Murphy echoes the sentiment. “We know, especially in a low-income community, we’re part of the community, we’re working to help the community,” he says. “No machine can do that.”

- Two former Google employees see your beloved local bodega and raise you a glorified vending machine. In typical Silicon Valley fashion, tech bros are capitalizing on the charm of your community mom-and-pop convenience store, aiming to put them out of business while co-opting their name.
- Bodega is a startup that wants to take on the convenience store. It envisions a future where instead of going to your local convenience store for affordable non-perishables, cigarettes, and toiletries, you will want to unlock a five-foot-wide pantry box with an app and hope it is equipped with the non-perishable item you need and can afford. Your credit card is automatically charged thanks to “cameras powered with computer vision,” according to Fast Company. The verdict is out if this unmanned box of probably overpriced pita chips will take cash.
- “The vision here is much bigger than the box itself,” Bodega co-founder Paul McDonald told Fast Company. “Eventually, centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you.”
- And when it comes to the company’s potentially offensive name, McDonald says he’s “not particularly concerned about it.”
- “We did surveys in the Latin American community to understand if they felt the name was a misappropriation of that term or had negative connotations, and 97% said ‘no.’” McDonald told the magazine. “It’s a simple name and I think it works.”
- Solving a problem that doesn’t exist to threaten the livelihoods of local bodegas is nefarious enough, but the venture also stands to get rid of arguably one of the most important bodega features—the bodega cat—which they’ve also co-opted for the startup’s logo. How dare you.
- According to a (mysteriously deleted) story on Techcrunch, the startup has already raised $2.5 million in financing. We have reached out to Techcrunch and Quartz, which also removed a story about Bogeda today without explanation, and will update this post when we hear back.
- Update 12:23pm: After becoming temporarily unavailable, the TechCrunch and Quartz stories are now back online. A reporter for Quartz said the story’s temporary disappearance on the site was the result of accidentally breaking a press embargo.

- In the case of Once Upon a Farm, the idea is to ship foil packets of baby food at a price more than twice of what they would cost at a grocery store, with vague promises to drive “social change.”
- But the startup Bodega is on a mission far more nefarious, say its critics. The goal of two ex-Google employees is to make sundry products such as deodorants, tampons and protein bars readily available via a smartphone app. Each of these pallid automated glass boxes would change its 100 or so various products over time based on what was being purchased. As ex-Googler Paul McDonald told Fast Company:
- Bodegas have long been part of life in New York for their hangover-curing breakfast creations, chopped cheese sandwiches, empanadas and last-minute sales of toothpaste and toilet paper. Even more importantly, they are neighborhood gathering places. In addition to serving smiles, and questions about one’s family or day, bodegas have also been economic and cultural steppingstones for immigrant families making a new life in the U.S.
- While associated with New York and to a lesser degree, Los Angeles, “bodega culture” has long been part of the American experience – only in different forms across the country. Cambodians started out in California by often running donut shops after fleeing the Khmer Rouge. Vietnamese refugees thrived in nail salons as they offered steady jobs while learning English and acclimating to a new life. Joe Biden was derided for his unartful comments about Indian-Americans and convenience stores a decade ago. The truth, however, is that many ethnicities anchored themselves in America with the corner store, including my Armenian grandparents, who ran a small grocery store in a dusty San Joaquin Valley town seven days a week for twenty years after moving to California.
- But in the city that never sleeps and where walking is often that “last mile” from finally getting from the office to home, the corner bodega has a special hold on New York's psyche. Many have been passed on to younger generations. Nowadays, many challenges lie ahead; for example, rising rents across New York City are forcing many to close.
- Nevertheless, bodegas are still a powerful force. Earlier this year, many closed in protest of the Trump Administration’s immigration ban. So from the point of view of many bodega owners, a smartphone-operated box cannot compete with the customer service and quick meals-on-the-go they offer. Others, however, not only see this startup as a threat to their livelihoods, but also as an insult. As repeated in many news stories, the head of the New York State Coalition of Hispanic Chamber of Commerce quickly slammed the idea.
- After all, the trademarked name alone is bad enough; but the logo's use of a cat, long a symbol of bodegas' neighborliness, was also a slap in the face to many bodega owners. “It’s either the worst-named startup of the year, or one of the greatest Silicon Valley heel gimmicks of all time,” said The Verge.
- McDonald has quickly apologized, but his mea culpa is worse than the company’s initial kickoff. “While we were hoping for a big response, the reaction that we got this morning certainly wasn’t what we expected,” wrote McDonald, which makes one wonder if he or the market research firm advising him bothered to visit a New York street corner other than, say, 5th Avenue and 64th or 65th.
- “We want to make sure our name — among other decisions we make — reflects those values. We’re here to learn and improve and hopefully bring a useful, new retail experience to places where commerce currently doesn’t exist,” continued McDonald.
- The absurdity of that comment is that he and Rajan are talking about offices, gyms, apartment lobbies and dormitories. Despite McDonald’s protests, this business is, in fact, about selling more stuff to the “stereotypical Whole Foods set.” Hence Vice was unleashed in their assessment of this concept: “The last thing the upper-middle class needs is another gadget that makes life marginally easier and more isolated from the outside world.”
- McDonald is clearly an outlier in the millennial world, one that increasingly demands that the companies for which they work have a social purpose. And therein lies the link to Once Upon a Farm. What is this social mission? Commerce is often non-existent in “food deserts,” remote rural towns and low-income neighborhoods. The business plan outlining the need for a “new retail experience” for the tech worker who forgot to bring the calendula-scented deodorant for his post-office workout should earn a C- in a business school marketing module at best.
- Hence the sad tale of a marketing campaign that ranks with other poorly executed promotions such as those for the Ford Edsel, New Coke and Trump Steaks. No wonder why Mashable was so mocking in its tone. “These box things were designed to replace bodegas, and nobody wants them,” summed up Colin Daileda.

- When it comes to failed public launches of Silicon Valley startups, there is bad, there is bumbling, and then there is Bodega.
- No doubt the team at Bodega woke up this morning ready to bask in the glow of a Fast Company profile that would feature their innovative approach to melding artificial intelligence to mobile retail, capturing a marketing zeitgeist surrounding the disruption surrounding retail.
- LOL. Nope.
- Instead, the team has been getting pounded all day on Twitter, forcing them to write the obligatory explanatory-apology Medium post in which they insist they are not the tone-deaf cultural appropriators locked in a bro-induced bubble that much of social media seems to think they are.

- “Today we announced Bodega, and while we were hoping for a big response, the reaction that we got this morning certainly wasn’t what we expected,” wrote cofounder Paul McDonald in a contender for understatement of the week.
- McDonald poses the question to himself: “Is it possible we didn’t fully understand what the reaction to the name would be?”
- Spoiler alert:
- “Yes, clearly,” he continues. “The name Bodega sparked a wave of criticism on social media far beyond what we ever imagined. When we first came up with the idea to call the company Bodega we recognized that there was a risk of it being interpreted as misappropriation. We did some homework — speaking to New Yorkers, branding people, and even running some survey work asking about the name and any potential offense it might cause. But it’s clear that we may not have been asking the right questions of the right people.”
- Somewhere, there is a PR person sprawled out drunk in a bar in a South of Market hipster bar.
- So what went wrong here? The name is an obvious misfire. Somewhere along the way, it’s surprising one of their investors didn’t say, “Cool concept, but ditch the name. Because this is 2017 and Twitter will go apeshit.”
- Beyond that, however, there is the attempt to vastly oversell what is an interesting but hardly world-changing experience, despite what the founders said to Fast Company:
- “The vision here is much bigger than the box itself,” McDonald is quoted as saying. “Eventually, centralized shopping locations won’t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you.”
- First off, this sounds like a parody of a description from a product in HBO’s Silicon Valley. But second, the idea of living in a world in which there is an AI-driven vending machine 100 feet from me at all times is perhaps the most depressing vision of the future I have ever heard anyone articulate. And I’m including apocalyptic, Terminator-like scenarios in that.
- If I do indeed find myself surrounded by vending machines at every turn, I pray that they turn sentient and end my misery by smothering me to death with bags of ranch-flavored Doritos and Nutter Butter cookies.

- Twitter users across the US howled in rage on Wednesday after getting wind of Bodega, the startup whose internet-connected pantry boxes want to replace your local corner store.
- Many observers criticized the choice of the Bodega name — which traditionally refers to mom-and-pop convenience stores in large American cities — and the notion that two former Google employees could put the beloved local shops out of business. In the Fast Company profile that ignited the storm, cofounder Paul McDonald laid out his vision for the automated kiosks. "Eventually, centralized shopping locations won't be necessary," he said, "because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you."
- Others were quick to label the Bodega boxes as the latest internet folly (See: Juicero), dismissing the kiosks as nothing more than a glorified vending machine for the millennial tech set.
- With so much hubbub we decided we needed to find a Bodega in the wild and see what it was like to actually use one. It turned out that finding a Bodega was not as simple as we expected it to be, but we eventually tracked one down. Here's what we found:
- The sinking 58-story tower is a private residence, and I couldn't make it past the receptionist, who made it clear there were no Bodegas in the building, despite what the Bodega website said.
- After hearing from Bodega cofounder Paul McDonald that the majority of the boxes weren't shipping until next week, I trekked over to Managed by Q, a local startup that is one of three San Francisco locations that already have a Bodega box on the premises. Managed by Q employees were kind enough to let me in, and in the back of the office I finally stood face-to-face with my prize.
- The employees at this particular office were very enthused about their Bodega machine and said it was used all the time. They told me they really appreciated having it since there were practically no other options for food or retail near their office. A cursory stroll around the neighborhood confirmed their claims of deprivation.
- Sadly, because the Bodega that I finally found was in a private company's location, I was unable to actually purchase any of the goodies within. In theory, the Bodega app should work with any box you find. But the startup I visited told me I needed to be signed in with its company to use it. Maybe it just wanted to get rid of me.
- Once you type the box number in the app, the doors to the Bodega store unlock and it's Open Sesame. As you can see from this image from a promotional video the company made, you just grab whatever you want and go on your way. Special cameras in the kiosk, which the company boasts use "computer vision and machine learning," automatically figure out what you took and charge you accordingly.
- We found that most of the items in the Bodega were cheaper or the same price as the ones at CVS. A Kind Bar went for $2.00 in the machine versus $2.49 at CVS, and a pack of Jalapeno Kettle chips was priced at $1.29 in the Bodega and $1.49 at CVS.
- The boxes are well-designed and make for a handy office amenity — a nicer version of the vending machine, stocked with a better selection.
- Nice as they are, the bodega boxes don't look as if they'll be putting traditional corner stores out of business anytime soon. The selection of sundries is limited to nonperishable items. And the alcohol and tobacco products that comprise the bulk of many a corner store's business were nowhere to be found.
- The real question now is whether the company can convince businesses and consumers to try out the kiosks or whether the backlash over the name has already done too much damage.
