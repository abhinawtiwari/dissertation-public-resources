- An automated alert sent to customers by KFC in Germany commemorating the 84th anniversary of Kristallnacht (or 'The Night of Broken Glass') has backfired.
- The alert urged customers to commemorate the Kristallnacht by eating its cheesy fried chicken. The Kristallnacht was the 1938 pogrom that preceded the Holocaustor and saw Nazi mobs destroy synagogues and Jewish-owned businesses, kill 91 Jews and send 30,000 to concentration camps.
- The promotion suggested customers 'Go ahead and treat yourself to more soft cheese on your crispy chicken. Now available at KFCheese!' under the subject line 'Memorial day for the Reich pogrom night'.
- KFC apologised after customers started complaining and the promotion was picked up by the EU arm of the Anti-Defamation League ('ADL'), whose associate director Dalia Grinfield tweeted 'How wrong can you get on Kristallnacht KFC Germany. Shame on you!'
- The fast food chain blamed the message on an 'automated push notification ... linked to calendars that include national observances', adding that it 'sincerely' apologised for the 'unplanned, insensitive and unacceptable message'.

- KFC has apologised after sending a promotional message to customers in Germany, urging them to commemorate Kristallnacht with cheesy chicken.
- The Nazi-led series of attacks in the country in 1938 left more than 90 Jewish people dead, and destroyed Jewish-owned businesses and places of worship.
- It is widely seen as the beginning of the Holocaust.
- The message, heavily criticised for its insensitivity, was later blamed on "an error in our system".
- The fast-food chain sent an app alert on Wednesday, saying: "It's memorial day for Kristallnacht! Treat yourself with more tender cheese on your crispy chicken. Now at KFCheese!"
- Around an hour later another message was sent with an apology, according to the Bild newspaper.
- "We are very sorry, we will check our internal processes immediately so that this does not happen again. Please excuse this error," the message is reported to have said.
- Germany takes the 9 November anniversary of Kristallnacht seriously, with numerous memorial events and discussions scheduled to reflect the Nazis' murder of more than six million Jewish people. It translates as Night of Broken Glass and is known in Germany as Reichspogromnacht, the term used in KFC's tweet.
- Daniel Sugarman, Director of Public Affairs at the Board of Deputies of British Jews described the original KFC message as "absolutely hideous".
- Dalia Grinfeld, the associate director of European affairs at the Jewish NGO Anti-Defamation League, tweeted: "How wrong can you get on Kristallnacht KFC Germany. Shame on you!"
- In a statement issued to Newsweek magazine, KFC Germany blamed the message on a bot.
- The fast food chain said the "automated push notification" was "linked to calendars that include national observances".
- It added that it "sincerely" apologised for the "unplanned, insensitive and unacceptable message" and said app communications had been suspended while an examination of them takes place.
- "We understand and respect the gravity and history of this day, and remain committed to equity, inclusion and belonging for all," the company finished by saying.

- Chicken von KFC bekommt in Verbindung mit der Reichspogromnacht einen mehr als faden Beigeschmack
- Da vergeht einem jeglicher Appetit…
- Die Fastfood-Kette „Kentucky Fried Chicken“ (KFC) verschickt in Verbindung mit dem Gedenken an die Reichspogromnacht eine Geschmacklos-Push-Nachricht an ihre App-Nutzer.
- Die mehr als fragwürdige Nachricht: „Gedenktag an die Reichspogromnacht – Gönn dir ruhig mehr zarten Cheese zum knusprigen Chicken. Jetzt bei KFCheese!“
- Fastfood-Werbung auf Kosten des Gedenkens der Opfer des Nazi-Regimes!
- KFC warb zur Reichsprogromnacht versehentlich mit „mehr zartem Cheese zum knusprigen Chicken“
- Immerhin: Das KFC-Team entschuldigte sich umgehend, ebenso mit einer App-Push.
- Ein „Fehler im System sei dafür verantwortlich“. Und weiter: Die „internen Prozesse“ würden umgehend überprüft.
- Feuerwehrleute stehen am 9. November 1938 vor der brennenden Synagoge in der Fasanenstrasse in Berlin, die bei Ausschreitungen gegen Juden und jüdische Einrichtungen angezündet wurde
- Mit der Pogromnacht vom 9. auf den 10. November 1938 gingen die Nazis zur offenen Gewalt gegen die jüdische Minderheit im Dritten Reich über. Sie setzen Synagogen in Brand, jüdische Geschäfte und Wohnungen wurden verwüstet, jüdische Bürger misshandelt.
- Drei Jahre vor Beginn der systematischen Massendeportationen und nach zahlreichen rechtlichen Diskriminierungen erhielt die Verfolgung der Juden mit den Ausschreitungen einen neuen Charakter.
- Wird der Holocaust im Namen der deutschen Diplomatie verharmlost? Riesen-Kritik am Goethe-Institut!
- Die Präsidentin der Kultusgemeinde feiert 90. Geburtstag.
- An den Gewalttaten beteiligten sich vor allem SA- und SS-Männer und Parteimitglieder, vielerorts aber auch Teile der deutschen Bevölkerung.
- Im Volksmund bürgerte sich wegen der zerstörten Fensterscheiben jüdischer Geschäfte der verharmlosende Name „Reichskristallnacht“ für die Ausschreitungen im November 1938 ein. Der Begriff wurde später durch die Bezeichnung „Reichspogromnacht“ ersetzt.
- Hannover: Blumenkränze liegen an der ehemaligen Synagoge in der Roten Reihe anlässlich des Gedenkens an die Pogromnacht in Niedersachsen vor 84 Jahren
- Die Mehrzahl der Synagogen und jüdischen Gebetshäuser ging in der Pogromnacht in Flammen auf. Die offizielle Bilanz waren rund 7500 verwüstete Geschäfte, 267 zerstörte Synagogen und Gemeindehäuser sowie 91 Tote. Wissenschaftler gehen heute davon aus, dass mehr als 1300 Menschen getötet und mindestens 1400 Synagogen in Deutschland und Österreich stark beschädigt oder zerstört wurden. Das öffentliche Leben der Juden in Deutschland kam nach den Pogromen völlig zum Erliegen.

- Firm messaged German customers to suggest they ‘commemorate’ Nazi atrocity by eating its food
- KFC has apologised for a push notification sent out via its app inviting German customers to celebrate the anniversary of the Nazi Kristallnacht pogrom against Jews by ordering fried chicken and cheese.
- It sent the message to its customers on Wednesday, the 84th anniversary of the Night of Broken Glass in which Nazis led gangs in the torching, vandalising and ransacking of Jewish shops, businesses and synagogues across Germany. The event is seen as the beginning of the Nazis’ systematic attempt to annihilate Europe’s Jewish population.
- KFC reached out to its customers with the message: “Commemorate Kristallnacht – treat yourself to more soft cheese and crispy chicken. Now at KFCheese!”
- About an hour later it sent out another message apologising for the first and blaming it on “a fault in our system”.
- It has been speculated that the message was computer generated, with the text to promote its cheesy chicken being automatically connected to current anniversaries and events to stimulate sales. But social media experts in Germany said they were astounded that the company had no checking mechanism to pick up on the blunder, apparently noticing only after it had been reported back to them that the erroneous message had gone out.
- The company has not explained how the message came to be sent out. In its correction, the company said: “We are very sorry, we will check our internal processes immediately so that this doesn’t happen again. Please excuse the error.”
- The tabloid Bild called the mistake “tasteless” and said it was “fast-food advertising at the cost of the remembrance of the victims of the Nazi regime”.
- In pogroms across Germany on the night between 9 and 10 November, 1938, Nazi mobs took to the streets of German towns and cities in an attempt to intimidate Jewish citizens with acts of violence. The attacks, in which large numbers of the SS and SA troops were involved, led to most of the country’s synagogues going up in flames.
- Official reports at the time said 91 people were killed in the attacks, about 7,500 businesses were devastated, and 267 synagogues and community halls were destroyed. But historians believe the real figure was higher, with more than 1,300 people losing their lives and at least 1,400 synagogues in Germany and Austria badly damaged or destroyed.
- The events of that night marked the end of Jews being able to lead public lives in Germany and prompted hundreds of thousands of Jewish families to flee the country. Three years later, the systematic mass deportations to concentration camps – which later became known as the Holocaust – began, in which an estimated 6 million European Jews were murdered.
- The incident recalled other fast-food advertising slogan gaffs, such as when McDonald’s in Portugal used the campaign slogan “Sundae Bloody Sundae” in a Halloween campaign for its ice-cream puddings. It pulled the campaign after protests, insisting it had never intended to refer to Bloody Sunday in 1972, when British paratroopers shot dead demonstrators at a civil rights march in Derry, Northern Ireland.

- Fast food restaurant sent a notification to app users suggesting customers ‘treat themselves’ on the anniversary of the 1938 ‘Night of Broken Glass’.
- KFC has apologised after sending a notification to German customers encouraging them to commemorate the Kristallnacht anti-Jewish pogrom with fried chicken and cheese.
- The fast food chain sent a notification to app users on Wednesday suggesting customers “treat themselves” on the anniversary of the 1938 Kristallnacht, or “Night of Broken Glass”, according to Twitter users who shared images of the message in German.
- “Commemoration of Kristallnacht – Treat yourself to more soft cheese and crispy chicken. Now at KFCheese!” the message read.
- An hour later it was followed by an apology, according to the Bild newspaper.
- “We are very sorry. We will check our internal processes immediately so that this does not happen again. Please excuse this error,” it said.
- Kristallnacht, also known as the Night of Broken Glass, refers to the outbreak of anti-Jewish attacks launched throughout Nazi Germany and parts of Austria on November 9, 1938.
- Kristallnacht owes its name to the shards of broken glass that littered the streets in the wake of the violence against Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues by Nazi paramilitaries.
- At least 91 Jews were murdered, about 7,500 Jewish businesses ransacked, and some 30,000 Jewish males arrested during the assaults, which presaged the Holocaust in which about six million Jews were killed.
- In a statement issued to Newsweek magazine, KFC Germany said the message was an “automated push notification”, and the team used “a semi-automated content creation process linked to calendars that include national observances”.
- “In this instance, our internal review process was not properly followed, resulting in a non-approved notification being shared,” KFC said.
- The restaurant chain added it “sincerely” apologised for the “unplanned, insensitive and unacceptable message”. Its tech team suspended app communications while the company examines the process.

- KFC Germany apologized for an “unacceptable” message sent to customers on Wednesday, which appeared to tie a sales promotion to the annual commemoration of Kristallnacht.
- KFC app users in the country received a message encouraging them to mark the day with crispy chicken and cheese from KFC, according to Twitter users who shared screengrabs of the message in German. The initial message was apparently followed by another, saying the first was an error.
- Kristallnacht, often translated as “Night of Broken Glass,” refers to a series of violent raids by the Nazi regime on Jewish businesses, homes and synagogues in 1938.
- “Earlier today an automated push notification was accidently [SIC] issued to KFC app users in Germany that contained an obviously unplanned, insensitive and unacceptable message,” KFC Germany said in a statement emailed to CNN Business. “We understand and respect the gravity and history of this day, and remain committed to equity, inclusion and belonging for all.”
- “We sincerely apologise,” the statement continued.
- KFC Germany didn’t confirm the language used in the alert.
- The company explained that it relies on a “semi-automated content creation process linked to calendars that include national observances,” adding that “in this instance, our internal review process was not properly followed, resulting in a non-approved notification being shared.”
- KFC Germany said yesterday that it suspended app communications while it put its process under review to make sure something like this doesn’t happen again.
- In this case, the company was able to blame an automated system for the mistake. But brands often get their messaging wrong around holidays or memorial days, especially ones that commemorate a painful occasion.
- Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the United States, became a federal holiday last year.
- Brands rushed to create messages and products for the holiday this year, and many missed the mark. Some relied on racist tropes to mark the occasion and others treated it like a glib celebration, leaving people disappointed and offended.
- KFC’s message resulted in similar outrage among some German customers and has been widely criticized on social media.

- Fast-food giant KFC has apologized to its German customers after it used the anniversary of the event that instigated the Holocaust to promote its chicken.
- Users of the chicken chain’s German app received a push notification on Wednesday that read: “It’s memorial day for Kristallnacht! Treat yourself with more tender cheese on your crispy chicken. Now at KFCheese!”
- Around an hour later, KFC sent a second alert to app users, according to German newspapers.
- “We are very sorry, we will check our internal processes immediately so that this does not happen again,” the company said via push notification. “Please excuse this error.”
- Kristallnacht is the name given to a wave of violent attacks on Jewish communities that took place throughout Germany and Austria over two days in 1938. The name, which translates to “Night of Crystal,” refers to the shattered glass from synagogues, homes, and Jewish-owned businesses that was left in the streets in the wake of the destruction.
- Kristallnacht—also known as “Night of the Broken Glass”—marked a turning point for Jewish people living in Nazi Germany, a regime that went on to murder at least 6 million Jews.
- KFC’s mishap is reported to have occurred when an automated system—which was designed to detect holidays and other days of significance and write relevant marketing messages—identified the anniversary of Kristallnacht and generated the push notification.
- Messages created by the system are supposed to be checked by a human being before being sent to users, according to the BBC, but this one slipped through the cracks.
- A spokesperson for KFC was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Fortune.
- However, in a statement to Newsweek, the company’s German operation pointed the finger at its bots.
- “Automated push notification was accidentally issued to KFC app users in Germany that contained an obviously unplanned, insensitive, and unacceptable message, and for this we sincerely apologize.
- “We use a semiautomated content creation process linked to calendars that include national observances,” it said. “In this instance, our internal review process was not properly followed, resulting in a non-approved notification being shared.”
- The company said it had suspended app communications while it examined its current processes to ensure similar problems did not arise again.
- “We understand and respect the gravity and history of this day, and remain committed to equity, inclusion, and belonging for all,” it told Newsweek.
- KFC has faced widespread condemnation over the blunder, with Twitter users taking to the platform to declare the promo “disgusting” and “pure anti-Semitism.”
- Daniel Sugarman, director of public affairs for the Board of Deputies of British Jews, described the marketing message as “absolutely hideous,” while Dalia Grinfeld, associate director for European affairs at Jewish NGO Anti-Defamation League, said in a message directed at KFC: “Shame on you.”

- The German branch of KFC has apologised after inviting customers to commemorate the Kristallnacht pogrom of 1938 by ordering a fried chicken dish.
- The fast-food chain was widely reviled after distributing the message through its German-language app on the 84th anniversary of mass antisemitic riots led by the Nazis across Germany and Austria, in which hundreds of synagogues were destroyed and more than 7,000 Jewish-owned shops were razed or looted.
- Under the subject line “Memorial day for the Reich pogrom night”, KFC Germany wrote: “Go ahead and treat yourself to more soft cheese on your crispy chicken. Now available at KFCheese.”

- KFC apologized this week for sending a mobile app alert telling German customers to "treat yourself" on Kristallnacht.
- Kristallnacht, or the night of broken glass, refers to the pogroms against Jewish people in Germany and Austria carried out by Nazis in November 1938. Some consider it the beginning of the Holocaust.
- On Wednesday, the Yum Brands chain sent a notification that reportedly said "It's memorial day for Kristallnacht! Treat yourself with more tender cheese on your crispy chicken. Now at KFCheese!"
- KFC said the notification contained "an obviously unplanned, insensitive and unacceptable message."
- "We understand and respect the gravity and history of this day, and remain committed to equity, inclusion and belonging for all," KFC said in a statement.
- The fried-chicken chain said that it uses a bot linked to national observances to create notifications for its mobile app. KFC said that the chain's internal review process wasn't followed properly, resulting in the alert going out to customers. It added that it has suspended app communications to make sure the mistake doesn't happen again.
- Recent anti-semitic comments from rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and NBA player Kyrie Irving have added to concerns about rising hate aimed at Jewish communities. In response to Ye's comments, Adidas severed ties with the rapper, and Gap pulled Yeezy items from its stores. Nike co-founder Phil Knight told CNBC that the company's relationship with Irving is likely finished.

- KFC is apologizing after a promoting a menu item as a way to commemorate Kristallnacht, the 1938 attacks by Nazis on Jews viewed by many as the start of the Holocaust.
- "It's memorial day for Kristallnacht! Treat yourself with more tender cheese on your crispy chicken. Now at KFCheese!," according to a translation from the BBC of a push notification sent on Wednesday to KFC app users in Germany.
- Soon after, three different screenshots of KFC's notification were posted on Twitter, drawing strong rebukes on social media.
- "Absolutely hideous," tweeted Daniel Sugarman, director of public affairs for the Board of Deputies of British Jews. "Utterly speechless and repulsed," tweeted Arsen Ostrovsky, head of International Legal Forum, a pro-Israel legal organization.

- Roughly an hour later, KFC followed with a retraction of sorts, with an all-caps alert saying: "SORRY, WE MADE A MISTAKE."
- "Because of a system error, we sent an incorrect and inappropriate alert on our app," the message said. "We are very sorry, we will check our internal processes immediately so that this does not happen again. Please excuse this error."
- Owned by Yum Brands, KFC told CBS MoneyWatch in an emailed statement that an automated push notification had been accidentally issued, containing an "unplanned, insensitive and unacceptable message."
- The company said it uses a semi-automated content creation process linked to calendars that include national observances, and in this case, its "internal review process was not properly followed."
- KFC has suspended app communications until it figures out how to make sure such an issue doesn't happen again, the company said, adding: "We understand and respect the gravity and history of this day, and remain committed to equity, inclusion and belonging for all."
- Kristallnacht, also known as "The Night of Broken Glass," references the November 9 pogroms carried out by Nazis against Jewish people in Germany and Austria 84 years ago. Over 48 hours, mobs destroyed hundreds of synagogues and 7,500 Jewish-owned businesses, homes and schools, killing 91, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

- More than 80 years ago, on Nov. 9, 1938, mobs took to the streets across Nazi Germany, laying waste to Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues in riots that police and firefighters did nothing to stop. Over the course of two days, sometimes in broad daylight, rioters looted and ransacked thousands of Jewish homes and business, and killed at least 91 Jews. Another 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps.
- The riots became known as “Kristallnacht,” a reference to the shattered glass in the streets afterward. Kristallnacht is widely considered the “turning point in the history of the Third Reich, marking the shift from antisemitic rhetoric and legislation to the violent, aggressive anti-Jewish measures that would culminate with the Holocaust,” according to a history from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.

- On Wednesday, the 84th commemoration of those brutal riots, KFC Germany sent out push notifications to users of the fried chicken chain’s app. The notification suggested that for the “[c]ommemoration of the Reich pogrom night,” customers could “[f]eel free to add more tender cheese to the crispy chicken,” according to a Google translation of the original message. “Now at KFCheese.”
- The blow back was immediate.
- “No, I don’t want tender cheese with my crispy chicken on #9november,” noted a DJ from Berlin on Twitter.

- “KFC in germany remembering the national socialist november pogroms against jews, the prelude to the shoah, with some tender cheese and crispy chicken,” noted one Berlin-based journalist, his words dripping with sarcasm.

- “Is this some disgusting joke? Meat and Dairy on Kristallnacht? This is definitely not acceptable they are making jokes out of one of the most painful events for Jews. The beginning of the Holocaust,” another journalist wrote.
- Within an hour of that push notification, KFC Germany sent out another message, apologizing multiple times for what it said was a system error.
- “Sorry, we made an error,” according to a Google translation of the notification. “Due to an error in our system, we sent an incorrect and inappropriate message through our app. We are very sorry, we will check our internal processes immediately so that this does not happen again. Please excuse this error. Team KFC.”

- Contacted by The Washington Post on Thursday, the chain’s media relations team relayed a more detailed explanation from KFC Germany. The statement reads:
- “On November 9, an automated push notification was accidently [sic] issued to KFC app users in Germany that contained an obviously unplanned, insensitive and unacceptable message and for this we sincerely apologise. We use a semi-automated content creation process linked to calendars that include national observances. In this instance, our internal review process was not properly followed, resulting in a non-approved notification being shared. We have suspended app communications while we examine our current process to ensure such an issue does not occur again. We understand and respect the gravity and history of this day, and remain committed to equity, inclusion and belonging for all.”
- KFC’s accidental promotion comes at a time when right-wing and antisemitic groups have increased their influence across Europe. The Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right populist party that some have branded an extremist group, had captured 94 seats in Germany’s federal parliament in 2017, but lost 11 of them during last year’s elections. Members of the AfD have downplayed the crimes committed during the Holocaust.
- “In November 1938, Nazi leaders and members of the Hitler Youth used Kristallnacht as a violent tool to instill fear among Jewish families and communities in Germany. More than 90 Jews were killed, thousands of businesses looted, and hundreds of synagogues and homes destroyed, intensifying persecution in order to exclude Jews from public life and force emigration,” Diane Saltzman, director of Survivor Affairs at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, said in a statement to The Post.
- “Today, recent incidents misusing Holocaust history have been increasing in frequency and intensity,” Saltzman continued. “Holocaust survivors, and everyone — especially in Germany — concerned about historical truth, should never have to see such a blatant attempt to minimize and capitalize on their pain. We hope people remember, learn from and study this history, and refrain from its misuse.”
