- Incroyable mais vrai. Et ce n'est pas non plus un poisson d'avril en retard.
- Le réseau social de Mark Zuckerberg a décidé de bannir la page Facebook de la ville de Bitche. Depuis plusieurs jours, l'administratrice du compte n'arrive plus à le remettre en place. En cause, le sens du mot qui est vulgaire en anglais. Les pages de la Citadelle ou encore du Golf avaient aussi été supprimées avant de réapparaître quelques jours plus tard, car l'administrateur peut faire appel de cette décision en cliquant sur un simple bouton. Mais cela n'a pas fonctionné pour la mairie de Bitche. Valérie Degouy est la responsable communication pour la commune.

- Son N°1 - Insolite : Bitche est censuré par Facebook
- Par contre Ville de Bitche a été dépubliée, j'ai fait appel le 19 mars et ça ne réapparait pas. J'ai essayé par tous les moyens de contacter Facebook, par les différents formulaires, mais il n'y a plus rien à faire. J'ai essayé en message privé sur la page Facebook France, j'ai laissé une dizaine de messages chaque jour. J'ai finalement été contactée pour me dire que ce n'était pas eux qui géraient, que si j'ai fait appel, je dois attendre la réponse de Facebook.
- Un problème qui ne date pas d'hier selon Valérie Degouy. A la création de la page, elle rencontrait déjà des difficultés.
- Son N°2 - Insolite : Bitche est censuré par Facebook
- Son N°2 - Insolite : Bitche est censuré par Facebook
- J'ai déjà eu des problèmes lors de la création de la page facebook de la ville. Pas moyen d'entrer le mot Bitche, c'était impossible. J'avais crée une page que j'avais appelé Ville fortifiée, et par contre j'avais la possibilité après, dans la description, de dire que c'était la page officielle de la ville de Bitche et, en même temps, le nom d'utilisateur c'était Ville de Bitche. A ce moment-là en 2016, c'était autorisé.
- Pour continuer à informer les citoyens, la mairie a dû se résoudre a nommé sa page Facebook Mairie 57230.
- Son N°3 - Insolite : Bitche est censuré par Facebook
- Son N°3 - Insolite : Bitche est censuré par Facebook
- Alors j'ai crée une nouvelle page que j'ai appelé Mairie 57230. J'aurais bien aimé l'appeler Mairie de Bitche mais le mot ne passe pas. Il y a le logo de la ville de Bitche qui montre clairement que c'est bien Bitche. La photo de couverture c'est l'hôtel de ville.
- 
- Selon Valérie Degouy, l'explication viendrait d'une délocalisation à l'étranger du site hébergeur Facebook pour la France. Le mot "Bitche" ne conviendrait plus à cause de sa ressemblance avec le mot "bitch".
- En apprenant les péripéties de son voisin, la commune de Rohrbach-lès-Bitche a décidé de prendre les devants avant que le même sort ne lui soit réservée. Vincent Seitlinger, est le maire de la commune.

- Son N°4 - Insolite : Bitche est censuré par Facebook
- Par mesure de précaution, pour que notre page ne soit pas suspendue, puisque ça peut durer plusieurs semaines voire plusieurs mois, on a préféré donc éviter tout problème et enlever Lès-Bitche à Rohrbach, de manière évidemment temporaire, le temps que ce malentendu avec Facebook puisse être réglé.
- 
- Pour le maire, il est inconcevable d'avoir encore ce type de problème en 2021.
- Son N°5 - Insolite : Bitche est censuré par Facebook
- Son N°5 - Insolite : Bitche est censuré par Facebook
- Ben oui, c'est quand même ce qui identifie notre secteur. C'est vrai que c'est irrecevable, d'autres communes demain en France vont peut-être connaître le même sort parce que dans leur nom il y a des termes qui prêtent à sourire en anglais. Je trouve que c'est lamentable de voir qu'aujourd'hui, une société comme Facebook, se permet de suspendre aussi facilement des pages qui sont des pages régulières et officielles.
- Quelle issue va connaître la ville de Bitche ? Facebook va-t-il réhabiliter un nom qui tient à coeur à 36 000 habitants sur ce territoire ? La réponse prochainement...

- In-depth reporting, data and actionable intelligence for policy professionals – all in one place.

- 
- You can probably guess why.
- Facebook has 99 problems, and the French town of Bitche is one.
- According to local broadcaster Radio Mélodie, the Facebook page for the small town in northeastern Moselle was taken down on March 19, forcing Valérie Degouy, Bitche's comms official, to create a new page on Monday named after its postal code: Mairie 57230.
- Degouy told Radio Mélodie on Monday that she appealed the decision the same day the town's page was taken down, but hadn't heard back from the tech giant. "I tried to reach out to Facebook in every possible way, through different forms, but there's nothing [I could] do," she said, adding that she had "already had issues when I first created the page."
- Facebook restored the page after this article was published on Tuesday morning.
- Another town in the region, Rohrbach-lès-Bitche, took preventive measures and renamed its page Ville de Rohrbach on Monday. "Facebook seems to be hunting a term associated with Rohrbach … we'll let you imagine the reason," the town said in a post announcing the move.
- Bitche — the e is silent — is a fortress town famed mostly for the siege of Bitche, which lasted 230 days during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 and 1871. Today, it has a little over 5,000 inhabitants.
- This is not the first time Bitche has been caught up in a censorship crossfire. In 1881, U.S. Ambassador to France Levi Parsons Morton took issue with the location of the American embassy on the Place de Bitche in Paris, named in honor of the town's wartime effort. Morton, embarrassed by the embassy's letterhead, asked Parisian authorities to rename the square — they obliged, changing it to Place des États-Unis.

- By  Chaim Gartenberg
- A city in France has had a real rollercoaster of a week, after its Facebook page was accidentally deleted for violating the terms and conditions of the site. Of course, the city of Bitche, France (in the Moselle department in northeastern France) hadn’t done anything in particular to violate any of Facebook’s rules — it just sounded a whole lot like it did.
- According to a report from Radio Mélodie (via Politico), Bitche’s troubles first began on March 19th, when the city’s official page — titled “Ville de Bitche,” which translates to the perfectly normal “City of Bitche” — was suddenly removed. Valérie Degouy, the city’s communication manager, attempted to contact Facebook to try to appeal the decision but was unsuccessful, and she eventually just made a new page titled “Mairie 57230,” after Bitche’s postal code.
- “I tried to reach out to Facebook in every possible way, through different forms, but there’s nothing [I could] do,” Degouy said, explaining that she had already run into similar issues with the social media company when creating the page back in 2016.
- Following the viral coverage of the confusion, Facebook quickly reinstated the page on Tuesday, telling CNN that it was “removed in error.”
- This kind of content moderation mix-up has been an issue on the internet for about as long as spam and profanity filters have been around. It even has a name: the Scunthorpe problem, after a similar incident in 1996 that saw AOL censor the name of the British town of Scunthrope due to filters confused over an unintentional profanity found within the name.
- And while, yes, this is objectively funny, there are larger implications here. Another town in the region — Rohrbach-lès-Bitche — has preemptively changed the name of its Facebook page to ensure that it won’t be accidentally caught up in Facebook’s profanity filter. A Facebook page to be able to communicate with residents and tourists is too important of a thing to not have in 2021, but due to Facebook’s broken content filters, towns are forced to change their digital identity to simply stay online.
- For its part, the city leadership seems to be taking the removal in good stride. A statement posted by Benoît Kieffer, the mayor of Bitche, to both the reinstated Facebook page and Bitche’s official website acknowledges the difficulties of content moderation and points out the importance of using human moderators to help differentiate between false positives (like Bitche) and more serious offenders.
- Kieffer goes on to ask Facebook to be more transparent and fair in how it makes these decisions, in addition to extending an invitation to both the head of Facebook’s French business as well as to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to visit Bitche for themselves.

- Sometimes, life can be a Bitche. The residents of a French town thought just that after social media giant Facebook removed Ville de Bitche’s official page from its site last month.
- “We received a Facebook message and we also noticed that it was missing,” Benoît Kieffer, mayor of Ville de Bitche, told CNN Tuesday. The page was taken down on March 19, Kieffer added.
- “At first, you wonder, was there a technical problem? However, with the length of time, it can be considered a real censorship.”
- The town, which has about 5,100 inhabitants, instead created a new Facebook page called Mairie 57230, based on its postal code.
- The original page was restored Tuesday morning when Facebook became aware, the California-based company told CNN, adding that it had been “removed in error.”
- Facebook will not notify the 533 million users exposed in online database
- On its website, Facebook says page names must be accurate and cannot contain phrases that might “be abusive.”
- “We can be happy that social networks take responsibility, that they remove illegal, problematic content,” said Kieffer. “But the other problem is to consider that the human gaze has the upper hand on artificial intelligence.”
- He added that the page was restored at about 10.30 a.m. (4.30 a.m. ET) Tuesday. “Before that, we had no news.”
- Kieffer invited Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to the town to “discover our pretty fortified city that has distinguished itself in history on several occasions.”
- The commune in northeastern France is known for the Bitche Citadel, which towers over the town on sandstone rock, according to France-Voyage.com, an online tourist guide. The historic monument was notoriously difficult to take over and famously held out for 230 days during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, said the site.
- The 100th Infantry Division at Fort Jackson, South Carolina helped liberate Bitche from German occupation in March 1945, earning themselves the moniker “Sons of Bitche,” according to the website of Grove, a city in Oklahoma.
- France to ban domestic flights where trains are available, in move to cut emissions
- “Bitchois and bitchoises are proud to wear this name. The Americans already wore it proudly with a touch of humor of course,” Kieffer added.
- Another nearby town named Rohrbach-lès-Bitche took preventative action and renamed its page Ville de Rohrbach on April 12.
- “As a precaution, so that our page is not suspended, since it can last several weeks or even months, we preferred to avoid any problem and remove ‘Les-Bitche’ next to Rohrbach, obviously temporarily, until this misunderstanding with Facebook can be resolved,” the town’s mayor, Vincent Seitlinger, told Radio Mélodie Monday.
- “I find it deplorable to see that today, a company like Facebook, can so easily suspend pages that are regular and official pages.”

- A FRENCH town called Bitche has been cancelled by Facebook – because it sounds like a sexist insult.
- Now other French places with names including Arse, Anus, Condom, and Pussy also risk being cancelled by the Facebook algorithms.
- Officials in the small community on the River Horn, on the German border, on Tuesday confirmed that the page "has been censored" since last month.
- “We’ve appealed but this can take a long while,” said a town hall spokesman in Bitche, which has a population of just 5000."
- In the meantime, they have renamed their Facebook page ‘Mairie 57230’ – a combination of the word for ‘town hall’ and their postcode.
- Valérie Degouy, a spokesperson for Bitche, told local radio: “I appealed on 19 March but [the page] hasn’t reappeared again. I have tried every way to contact Facebook, through the different forms, but there is nothing more to do.
- "I tried to send a private message on the Facebook France page, I left about 10 messages every day.
- "I was finally contacted and told that they were not in charge, that if I appealed, I would have to wait for a response from Facebook.
- “I already had problems when I created the town’s Facebook page. I could not enter the word Bitche, it was impossible.
- "I had to create a page that I had called Ville fortifiée, and change it afterwards, in the description, to say that it was the official page of the town of Bitche and point out at the same time, the user name was Ville de Bitche. At that time in 2016, it was allowed.”
- She added: “I created a new page and called it Mairie 57230. I would have liked to call it Mairie de Bitche but the word doesn’t work.
- "There is a logo of the city of Bitche which clearly shows that it is Bitche. The cover photo is the town hall.”
- Bitche is situated in an eastern area of France called Pays de Bitche, which means Bitch country.
- It has been fought over for centuries with the Germans, who call in Bitscherland.
- The Local Melodie Radio station reported that other towns in the Bitche area were reviewing their social media names, so as to avoid deletion.
- “Don’t ever call me Bitche again,” the station posted on its own Facebook site, apparently mocking the Facebook’s cancel culture.
- The America Embassy in Paris was once situated in Place de Bitche – Bitch Square – in honour of the town’s resistance during the Franco-Prussian War in 1871.
- But it was renamed United States Square after the Ambassador objected in 1881.
- The Bitche row is likely to lead to headaches in other French towns with embarrassing names.
- They include Condom, in south west France, and Orgy, in the centre of the country.
- There is also an Arse Stream (Ruisseau de l’Arse) and an Arse Waterfall (Cascade d’Arse).
- The village of Anus also exists in the Burgundy wine region of France, and there is a town called Pussy close to the Italian border.
- Condom once tried to twin itself with a town in the UK, but was denied due to nobody in Britain wanting to be linked with it.
- And Germany is home to a mountain called Wank - where visitors can find a mountain hut at the summit, called the Wank-Haus.
- Last year a village called F***ing was forced to change its name after locals became fed up with randy tourists having sex by the road signs.
- The Austrian village is now known by a new name - Fugging - after town hall chiefs’ patience finally snapped.
- Over the years, the village has been become an understandable draw for sniggering tourists, who make a point of stopping in to snap themselves by the signpost
- As well as having sex by the signposts, tourists have also been making off with them, leading the local authorities to use theft-resistant concrete when putting up replacements.
- The town’s name has long been a source of amusement in the English speaking world.

- The French town of Bitche, on the northeastern border with Germany, had previously caused embarrassment for the US embassy.
- Thursday 6 May 2021 11:06, UK
- Facebook has been criticised after taking down the official page for the French town of Bitche.
- Local broadcaster Radio Melodie reported that the page was taken down, forcing the municipal communications officer to create a new one under another name.
- Ms Valerie Degouy said the new page was named after the town's post code, Mairie 57230, as reported by Politico.
- Ms Degouy said: "I tried to reach out to Facebook in every possible way, through different forms, but there's nothing [I could] do," she said, adding she had "already had issues when I first created the page".
- Another of the commune's towns, Rohrbach-les-Bitches, renamed its page Ville de Rohrbach out of caution.
- In a post explaining the change, the account holder said: "Far from us the idea of denying the name of our beautiful village... [but] Facebook seems to be hunting the term associated with Rohrbach...

- As Politico reports, this is not the first time that the town's name has caused upset for Americans.
- Back in 1881, the US embassy was located on the Place de Bitche in Paris, named in honour of the town.
- The then ambassador, Levi Parsons Morton, complained about the name as it appeared to be embarrassing on the embassy's letterhead and Parisian authorities renamed the square Place des Etats-Unis.
- A spokesperson for Facebook confirmed to Sky News that the page was removed in error, and had since been "swiftly restored this morning, when we became aware of the issue".

- Facebook mistakenly took down the official page for a French town called Bitche, after its algorithms dubbed the name as offensive.
- The official page for Bitche, a town in northeastern France near the border with Germany, was removed on March 19, but has only just been addressed by Facebook.
- Facebook France said the mistake was made 'following an incorrect analysis on the part of our systems'.
- It has since apologised for the embarrassing error and restored the page.
- Earlier this year, Facebook apologised for banning users from mentioning National Trust beauty spot Devil's Dyke near Brighton after branding it ‘hate speech'.

- A Facebook spokesperson told MailOnline that the Bitche page was removed in error and was restored on Tuesday morning.
- The mistake – reported by local broadcaster Radio Melodie – forced Bitche municipal communications officer Valerie Degouy to create a new page under another name earlier this month.
- Degouy said the new page was named after the town's post code, Mairie 57230, to get past Facebook's automated moderating system.
- 'I tried to reach out to Facebook in every possible way, through different forms, but there's nothing [I could] do,' Degouy said.
- She added that she 'already had issues when [she] first created the page'.
- The town's original page is once again active, and on Tuesday posted a statement regarding the debacle.
- The statement, translated to English, reads: 'Facebook had censored our Bitche City page.
- 'We appealed and tried to contact Facebook through various means, including through contact forms and private messages on Facebook France's page.'
- Laurent Solly, President General Manager of Facebook France, personally contacted Bitche Mayor Benoît Kieffer to inform him that the page has been published again and to apologise for any inconvenience caused.

- 'What has happened to the town of Bitche demonstrates the insufficient and limited moderating tools that only the human gaze can appreciate,' he said.
- Kieffer did add, however, that Bitche would welcome Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg 'to discover our pretty fortified city'.
- As noticed by Politico, another town in the region, Rohrbach-lès-Bitche, took preventive measures and renamed its page 'Ville de Rohrbach'.
- The town said in a post of its own: 'We wanted to explain the name change of the page.
- 'Far from us the idea of denying the name of our beautiful village... but it is to see that Facebook seems to be hunting the term.
- 'We preferred to anticipate rather than risking a page closure.'
- Below is Bitche Mayor Benoît Kieffer's full statement translated from French.
- Facebook had censored our City of Bitche page.
- We have appealed and attempted to contact Facebook through various means, including through contact forms and private messages on the Facebook France page.
- On March 19, Facebook informed us that our Town of Bitche page was no longer published, on the grounds that it was 'in violation of the terms applicable to Facebook pages'.
- The city’s Facebook page was hosted in a data center located in Europe and in a hypothetical, we assume that our page has migrated to an Anglo-Saxon server which has set up moderations and algorithms that remove illegal and problematic content.
- The name of our city seemed to suffer from a misinterpretation.
- I accept that Facebook will put in place locks, police, comply with the prescriptions of the European Union, which intends to domesticate GAFA and better supervise practices, in particular in application of the 2020 European 'Digital Service Act' regulation.
- That Facebook gives pledges, takes responsibility, justifies its content and today plays its role of moderator and regulator of its social network.
- What happened to the town of Bitche demonstrates the insufficiency and the limits of the moderation tools that only a human eye can appreciate, especially with regard to the verification of sources.
- The amazing thing is that it lasted and that Facebook took so long to correct this incident.
- The CEO of Facebook France has just contacted me personally to inform me that the page for the town of Bitche has been published again and to apologise for the inconvenience that may have been caused.
- Today I send two invitations:
- - The first, to the Facebook 'institution': that of being transparent, but also, by obligation, to be an intelligent and fair tool
- - The second, I humbly address it to Mr. Mark ZUCKERBERG and to Mr. General President of Facebook France, whom I would be pleased, along with my fellow citizens, to welcome at Bitche to make them discover our pretty fortified city which has been illustrated in history at several times, but also to honor together, with them, the memory of the compatriots and of our American friends who, under the banner of the 100th Infantry Division, came, from South Carolina, liberate our city; our liberators who are then themselves named, with pride, the 'Sons of Bitche'

- Bitche's official page was removed for being 'in violation of conditions'
- Facebook has been criticised for temporarily removing the official page of the small French town of Bitche.
- The social network's algorithm confused the name of the town in Moselle, north-east France, with the English insult.
- Bitche's mayor said the Facebook page of the town (population 5,000) was removed on 19 March for violating site rules.
- Facebook said it had reinstated the page on Tuesday after spotting the error.
- "On 19 March, Facebook informed us that our page, Ville de Bitche, was no longer online, on the basis that it was 'in violation of conditions applying to Facebook pages'," the town's mayor, Benoît Kieffer, said in a statement (in French).
- "The name of our town seemed to suffer from a bad interpretation," he added.

- Bitche's mayor invited Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to visit "our pretty fortified town"
- After the page was removed, the town hall had to create a new page, Mairie 57230, named in reference to the town's postcode.
- Mr Kieffer criticised Facebook's methods for monitoring content.
- "What has happened to the town of Bitche demonstrates the insufficient and limited moderating tools that only the human gaze can appreciate," he said.
- The mayor said the president of French Facebook had contacted him on Tuesday to tell him the page had been reinstated and to apologise for the inconvenience.
- Mr Kieffer invited him, as well as Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, to visit Bitche "to discover our pretty fortified town".
- A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday: "The page was removed in error and was swiftly restored this morning, when we became aware of the issue."
- Another town in the region, Rohrbach-lès-Bitche, renamed its page "Ville de Rohrbach" on Monday.
- "Facebook seems to be hunting a term associated with Rohrbach… we'll let you imagine the reason," the town said in a post explaining the move.

- Facebook’s hater-in-chief The Algorithm has come for a quiet French town to bring down the ban hammer with literally no warning. The town of Ville de Bitche, population 5,000, has spent the month appealing to the authorities of Facebook France, who have mercifully reinstated the town’s page. In the meantime, Ville de Bitche set up an alternate page containing its zip code.
- “The name of our city seemed to suffer from a misinterpretation,” Ville de Bitche mayor Benoît Kieffer stated in a press release. The page was reinstated this morning, with a personal apology from the president of Facebook France.
- Ville de Bitche, located on the border between France and Germany, has persevered through strife, including a siege by Austrians in the Hundred Days War and later a Nazi occupation—casting a long shadow over whatever Facebook claims to be its accomplishments.
- While Facebook didn’t specify a reason for the takedown, the town safely assumed the culprit was Facebook’s anglophone algorithm. “[In] a hypothetical, we assume that our page has migrated to an Anglo-Saxon server which has set up moderations and algorithms that remove illegal and problematic content,” Mayor Kieffer wrote. This hypothesis still doesn’t explain why, elsewhere, Facebook appears to appreciate the word’s versatility and dynamism, allowing its appearance with clinical seriousness on show dog pages and the punchy long-running feminist publication Bitch Media.
- Touché, Zuckerberg, because Kieffer has invited you to visit the town to honor the South Carolinian infantry division, “Sons of Bitche,” who liberated the town from Nazis.
- In an email to Gizmodo, Facebook declined to confirm Zuckerberg’s next move.
- It confirmed the accidental removal, blaming an “incorrect analysis by our systems” and said that Facebook France has reached out to the city of Bitche this morning. Facebook did not specify whether the name was the issue.
- If the story sounds familiar, this is a thing: the “Scunthorpe problem” is a phenomenon named for the English town whose name includes a four-letter word which AOL’s detection system found objectionable. The town joins “Devil’s Dyke,” “Plymouth Hoe,” British pork meatballs “faggots,” and people whose last names contain “cum” or “shit.”

- Ville de Bitche in north-east France had fallen foul of social network’s algorithm
- Life’s a Bitche for one historic town in north-east France that has received an apology from Facebook after its page was shut down for apparently using offensive language.
- Bitche in the Moselle, population 5,000 and home to the Bitchois, fell foul of the social network’s algorithm, which deemed it insulting and removed it without explanation last month.
- On Tuesday, after reports of the Facebook suspension spread, the social network restored the Ville de Bitche page.
- The mayor, Benoît Kieffer, said in a post: “The name of our town seems to suffer from a bad interpretation … the most astonishing thing is that Facebook took so long to correct this. The president/director general of Facebook France has just contacted me personally to tell me the Ville de Bitche page is published again and to apologise for the inconvenience caused.”
- Facebook told the Guardian the page was unpublished because of an incorrect analysis by its systems and has now been restored.
- The town’s page disappeared from Facebook on 19 March without any warning or apparent reason. In the interim, town hall staff created a new page, Mairie 57230, the town’s postcode, to keep its residents up to date with local news and information.
- Before the page was reinstated, Valérie Degouy, a spokesperson for Bitche, toldthe local radio station Radio Melodie: “I appealed on 19 March but [the page] hasn’t reappeared again. I have tried every way to contact Facebook, through the different forms, but there is nothing more to do. I tried to send a private message on the Facebook France page, I left about 10 messages every day. I was finally contacted and told that they were not in charge, that if I appealed, I would have to wait for a response from Facebook.
- “I already had problems when I created the town’s Facebook page. I could not enter the word Bitche, it was impossible. I had to create a page that I had called Ville fortifiée, and change it afterwards, in the description, to say that it was the official page of the town of Bitche and point out at the same time, the username was Ville de Bitche. At that time in 2016, it was allowed.”
- She added: “I created a new page and called it Mairie 57230. I would have liked to call it Mairie de Bitche but the word doesn’t work. There is a logo of the city of Bitche which clearly shows that it is Bitche. The cover photo is the town hall.”
- After Facebook restored the town’s page, Kieffer said: “I and my fellow citizens would like to humbly invite Monsieur Mark Zuckerberg and Monsieur the president general of Facebook France to our lovely fortified town, which has distinguished itself in history several times.
- “Together, we can honour together the memory of compatriots and our American friends who under the flag of the 100 Infantry Division came from South Carolina to liberate our town: liberators who called themselves, with pride, the ‘sons of Bitche’.”
