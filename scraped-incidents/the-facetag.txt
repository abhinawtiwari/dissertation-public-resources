- Harvard student Yuen Ler Chow has created The Facetag, a networking app that enables users to scan fellow students' faces using facial recognition and to exchange contact details.
- Despite providing a privacy feature whereby a user must give permission before someone else accesses their profile, and storing userdata on Google Cloud, the app has raised privacy, ethics, and security concerns and led to a backlash amongst Harvard students, social media users, digital rights advocates and commentators.
- 'It's kinda weird how I see so many people scared over the fact that I'm collecting this data, but almost all the other social media apps collect way, way more' he argues.
- Chow claims 'FaceTag is the next Facebook.' 'I’m Zuck, but better' he claims, saying he aims to expand FaceTag to other colleges and communities.
