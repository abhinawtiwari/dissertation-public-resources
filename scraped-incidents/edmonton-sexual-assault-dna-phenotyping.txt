- The Edmonton Police Service (EPS) is under fire from Black and civil rights organisations for using a controversial DNA prediction technology to solve a 2019 sexual assault in which there no witnesses, surveillance video, public tips or DNA matches.
- Their investigation having gone cold, the police turned to Parabon NanoLabs to conduct DNA phenotyping, which uses a person’s genetic material to predict parts of their appearance such as eye, skin and hair colour, as well as facial features including shape.
- Police can use such information to narrow suspects and generate leads in criminal investigations.
- Parabon produced for EPS a composite 'Snapshot' of a five-foot-four Black man with dark brown to black hair and dark brown eyes based on trait predictions from DNA evidence collected from the victim.
- The police published the image of a suspect for circulation in the hope it would generate leads. However, it led to a significant backlash, with local communities accusing the police of stereotyping a Black suspect and stigmatising racial groups. Two days later, the EPS apologised and removed the image from its website and social media accounts.
- Like other DNA analysis tools, TrueAllele's Snapshot is an algorithmic black box 'the exact details of our method [which] have not been published', the company acknowledges, adding that it has 'attempted to be as transparent as possible by presenting our work at conferences and posting every single composite that goes public on our website, so people can draw their own conclusions about how well our technology works.'
- University of Calgary biological anthropologist and evolutionary biologist Benedikt Hallgrímsson told the New York Times in 2015 that forensic DNA phenotyping was 'a bit of science fiction at this point', and that Parabon 'oversell their ability to predict the facial-shape phenotypes.'

URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabon_NanoLabs
- Parabon NanoLabs, Inc. is a company based in Reston, Virginia, that develops nanopharmaceuticals[1] and provides DNA phenotyping services for law enforcement organizations.[2]
- Parabon NanoLabs, a subsidiary of Parabon Computation, a computing software provider,[3] was founded in 2008 by Steven Armentrout, Michael Norton and Christopher Dwyer.  In 2018 Armentrout was the chief executive officer and President of Parabon Computation.[1][4][5] Parabon NanoLabs has developed oncology therapeutics and synthetic vaccines using nanotechnology and DNA phenotyping.[1]
- Together with the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, the United States Army Research Office and the  National Science Foundation as part of a project in the Federal Small Business Innovation Research program, Parabon developed a computer aided design software called inSēquio Design Studio for nanoengineering DNA constructs.  This software was used to design and develop synthetic vaccines.[6]
- Snapshot DNA Phenotyping Service is the name of a DNA phenotyping tool developed by Parabon NanoLabs which creates composite face imaging sketches based on DNA samples.[7] The algorithms used to make the composites are not open source, however, which has attracted criticism from members of the scientific community.[7][8] Moses Schanfield, professor of forensic sciences at George Washington University, criticized the lack of any peer review, noting that there is no publicly available performance record for the product.[5] In a 2016 article the American Civil Liberties Union recommended only using genetic phenotyping "...where the link between genes and external characteristics is based on well-proven, peer-reviewed, widely accepted science, such as is apparently now the case with hair and eye color."[9] Skin color predictions have been reported to be somewhat reliable but not predictions of the shape of the face.[10]  North Carolina detectives felt Parabon's Snapshot DNA Phenotyping Service had been helpful in identifying Jose Alvarez, Jr. in 2015 as the killer of Troy and LaDonna French in 2012.[11] Privacy restrictions in 2019 on the use of GEDmatch for genetic genealogy may make DNA phenotyping more common.[12] Illumina, Inc. and Identitas AG are reported to offer similar DNA phenotyping services.[13]  The United States Department of Defense provided approximately $2,000,000 in development financing for Snapshot.[10]
- Parabon NanoLabs was awarded a two-year contract by the United States Department of Defense to develop a software platform dubbed 'Keystone' for the forensic analysis of DNA evidence.[12]
- In May 2018 Parabon NanoLabs appointed genealogist CeCe Moore as head of their genetic genealogy unit[14] with three genealogists working for her.
- In cooperation with American law enforcement, Parabon uploaded DNA evidence from crime scenes to GEDmatch in an attempt to identify perpetrators.[15]
- In November 2018 Parabon said they were working on 200 cases, 55% had produced leads[16][17] and in May 2019 they said were solving cold cases at the rate of one a week.[18]
- In May 2019, GEDmatch required people who had uploaded their DNA to its site to specifically opt in to allow law enforcement agencies to access their information. This change in privacy policy was forecast to make it much more difficult in the future for law enforcement agencies and Parabon to identify suspects and solve cold cases using genetic genealogy.[19][20]
- According to an article published by Los Angeles Times in November 2019, "[CeCe] Moore said Parabon has opened about 300 DNA searches and that the lab has solved almost 100 cases — though arrests have not yet been made in several dozen of those cases."[21] In May 2020 it was reported that Parabon had participated in nearly 500 cases with 109 suspect positive identifications.[3]
- In December 2019, it was announced that GEDmatch was sold to forensic, for-profit, DNA analysis company Verogen,[22] whose CEO Brett Williams vowed to make the database safer for its customers, including fighting search warrants.[23]
- In a May 2020 interview with Scott Fisher of the podcast Extreme Genes, Moore revealed that in her capacity as the genetic genealogy lead, she no longer uses GEDmatch exclusively because of the decline of profiles available to law enforcement. Moore stated, "So, it would be better obviously, if we still had access to the full [GEDmatch] database, that million plus profiles, but it hasn’t stopped us. Also, we are using Family Tree DNA more and more all the time. Parabon is not able to upload directly but the agencies we work with can get the raw data from us and upload it to Family Tree DNA and then come back with that login information for us. So, we’re also helping to solve some cases with Family Tree DNA matches now. And as you know, theirs is the opt-out situation where you’re automatically opted in if you’re a US customer, unless you choose to opt out."[24] This restricted direct-access limitation may be due to the fact that FamilyTreeDNA has their own genetic genealogy consultant, Barbara Rae-Venter, who solved the Golden State Killer cold case in May 2018.[25]
- On 26 May 2020, the ABC television network premiered The Genetic Detective,[26] featuring Parabon's Moore, Steven Armentrout, Ph.D., and Ellen McRae Greytak, Ph.D. The hour-long episodes feature cases that Moore's genetic genealogy team has worked on since she started with Parabon.
- The following list of case results may offer an overview of Parabon's increasing activity.
- The following cases include suspects who were identified and then arrested for the indicated offenses. All suspects are considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Convictions are highlighted in green.
- In the following cases, the suspect arrested for the offense subsequently confessed and was sentenced without going to trial.
- In these cases, the offender was identified, but died without ever being brought to justice. Although the percentage accuracy in the identification of these primary suspects is extremely high, the cases remain open because there can be no convictions.
- Unidentified remains of deceased individuals are given the names Jane Doe for females and John Doe for males. In cases where homicide is suspected, the identification of the remains is the first step in finding the deceased's killer. Not all Does are victims of homicide, however.
- If you wish to provide information anonymously, call or text Secret Witness at (775) 322–4900.[251]

- Edmonton police say they are using DNA phenotyping, for the first time in its history, in trying to solve a sexual assault.
- DNA phenotyping predicts physical appearance and ancestry from unidentified DNA evidence, and police use that information to narrow suspects and generate leads in criminal investigations.
- Det. Colleen Maynes says the method is a last resort after all other investigative avenues have been exhausted.
- “This was a vicious assault,” said Maynes, adding she doesn’t want to see the perpetrator act again.
- A woman lost consciousness after she was violently sexually assaulted by a man who followed her from a bus stop in the central Spruce Avenue neighbourhood in March of 2019.
- She sustained serious injuries and was found wearing only a shirt when it was -27 C.
- “This survivor deserves justice,” said Maynes.
- There were no witnesses, surveillance video, public tips or DNA matches in the case.
- Detectives enlisted DNA technology company Parabon NanoLabs in Virginia to help in the investigation. The lab has provided DNA phenotyping to help with other files in Saskatchewan and Ontario.
- Most DNA testing in Canada goes through the RCMP’s lab. Maynes said this can take a long time, as the RCMP deals with cases across the country and doesn’t have the resources or technologies that other labs do.
- “We are lacking with that technology here in Canada,” said Maynes.
- Paula Armentrout with Parabon said that since 2018, its labs have helped solve 230 violent crimes in North America, although not all of them used DNA phenotyping.
- DNA phenotyping is not exclusive to sexual assault cases. The analysis has also been used to find possible suspects in murder cases and to identify remains.
- With a computer-generated snapshot in the Edmonton sex assault case, DNA phenotyping determined the suspect to be a Black man with dark brown to black hair and dark brown eyes who stands about five-foot-four.
- Armentrout said the turnaround for this type of analysis is about 45 days after receiving a DNA sample.
- Police said the suspect’s description may impact a marginalized community. After consulting with community stakeholders and considering the severity of the assault and the threat to public safety, police released the details with a computer-generated image.
- Any leads generated from the image will require further investigative steps, said Maynes.
- “It is by no means an immediate path to accusing a suspect,” she said. “What it does is potentially give us leads in a cold case, and we can follow up with DNA testing from there.”

URL: https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-police-issue-apology-for-controversial-use-of-dna-phenotyping-1.6608457
- The Edmonton Police Service has issued an apology for publicizing the use of DNA phenotyping in attempting to identify a sexual assault suspect.
- Earlier this week, on Tuesday, Edmonton police released information and held a news conference about the use of phenotyping — predicting physical appearance and ancestry using unidentified DNA evidence — in a brutal 2019 sexual assault.
- A police investigation was unable to find any witnesses, CCTV, public tips or DNA matches and police said they turned to Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs as a last resort.
- Police paid Parabon $1,700 for the service.
- The news release included an image, since removed from the EPS website and social media, that shows a computer-generated visual of a Black man with short hair alongside information describing a person of East African descent.
- It was widely criticized as racist on social media.
- On Thursday, EPS posted a statement on its website from Enyinnah Okere, chief operating officer for its Community Safety and Well-being Bureau, taking responsibility for the news release.
- In the statement, Okere said the police service failed to balance the potential investigative value with the risks and unintended consequences for marginalized communities.
- "The potential that a visual profile can provide far too broad a characterization from within a racialized community and in this case, Edmonton's Black community, was not something I adequately considered," he said.
- He said police had tried to qualify the benefits and limits of the technique. In the Tuesday news release, police had pointed out that phenotype composites only produce scientific approximations of appearance not likely to be exact replicas.
- "We have heard legitimate external criticism and we have done our own gut checks internally to determine whether we got the balance right — and, as a leader, I don't think I did," Okere said at a news conference Thursday.
- "While the tension I felt over this was very real, I prioritized the investigation — which in this case involved the pursuit of justice for the victim, herself a member of a racialized community, over the potential harm to the Black community. This was not an acceptable trade-off and I apologize for this."
- Okere said EPS is taking steps in response, including removing the visuals from its website. The police service will review internal processes to better inform decisions going forward, he said.
- "We got that wrong and that's something that we're going to learn from moving forward," Okere said as he admitted he received a lot of pushback from the community.
- Okere did not rule out the future possible use of phenotyping in other cases.
- University of Alberta law Prof. Ubaka Ogbogu said he was surprised by the apology, but said that in his opinion, it showed a lack of self-awareness on the part of the police service.
- "It's not an apology. It's an explanation of why they did it," Ogbogu told CBC News. "What you've done is you've impacted the Black community as a whole … that image looks like people I know."
- Ogbogu said he doesn't think that removing the image from the Edmonton police website will reverse the harm that's already been done, especially since the story made international news.
- "It reinforces the view that Black people commit these crimes and that any generic Black man could be yanked from the streets and accused of doing something they didn't do," Ogbogu said.
- "It's reckless in a lot of ways."

- 
- Spearheaded by the Africa Centre, the letter lists support from eight Edmonton-based, Black-led organizations who said they’re “deeply disturbed” with use of the technology as an investigative tool.
- 
- “Our community feels traumatized, scapegoated and humiliated,” the letter said, adding that the practice both deepens historical mistrust and lowers confidence in policing.
- 
- 
- After a 2019 sexual assault investigation had gone cold, Edmonton Police Service (EPS) announced on Oct. 4 that it had sought assistance from a technology company in the U.S. to perform DNA phenotyping, which uses a person’s genetic material to predict parts of their appearance such as eye, skin and hair colour as well as facial features including shape.
- 
- The company, Parabon Nanolabs, produced a composite “snapshot” based on trait predictions from DNA evidence collected in the investigation, and police published the image of a suspect for circulation in the hope it would generate leads.
- 
- But rather than advancing the investigation, the image garnered community backlash for broadly characterizing a Black suspect, and stigmatizing as well as criminalizing racialized groups, police said.
- 
- Two days later, EPS announced that it would remove the image from its website and social media accounts. Enyinnah Okere, chief operating officer of EPS’s bureau for community safety and well-being, apologized for prioritizing the investigation over harm the image may have had on Edmonton’s Black community.
- 
- However, Okere gave no indication at the time that police would rule out the tool in future investigations. Rather, he said, EPS will be creating processes to ensure police use of the technology doesn’t disproportionately affect some communities.
- 
- 
- The letter, which was also addressed to Edmonton’s city council, expresses a desire to see elected representatives hold a public hearing on the matter, and issue a statement in support of ending police use of DNA phenotyping.
- 
- Sharif Haji, executive director of the Africa Centre, told Postmedia the groups aim to see both council and the commission in sync on ceasing the practice.
- 
- “It is viewed as part of systemic racism or discrimination that specifically targets certain populations,” he said, recognizing that while council doesn’t direct police, the commission provides police oversight and is responsible to council.
- 
- A 2019 scientific journal article on the topic reported discrimination against minority groups as one of the biggest risks in forensic use of the technology.
- 
- In an email statement to Postmedia, McDougall said the commission acknowledges community concerns about police use of DNA phenotyping, and is committed to ending systemic racism.
- 
- EPS is due to address the matter in Thursday’s police commission meeting, he said.
- 
- “We look forward to this opportunity to ensure accountability by asking (EPS) questions about this technology in a public forum,” McDougall said, adding that the commission reserves further comment on the topic before exploring it with police.
- 
- In response to the letter, Mayor Amarjeet Sohi gave no indication that council would hold a public hearing on the incident, but recognized that police use of DNA phenotyping can have unintended consequences for racialized communities.
- 
- “I was pleased to see EPS apologized to Edmontonians following their concerns about the technology,” he told Postmedia in a statement, “and I hope that it, or any other technology that could negatively impact marginalized communities, is never used now or in the future.”

- On Tuesday, police announced they used DNA phenotyping to generate and release an image of a Black male suspect sought in a violent sexual assault from March 2019. Police had only a limited description of the suspect, who was masked and wearing heavy winter clothing, and this procedure, described as “a last resort,” uses a person’s genetic material to predict parts of their appearance such as eye, skin and hair colour as well as facial features including shape.

- 
- But on Thursday, police said they are removing the image from the news release on its website as well as its social media accounts.
- 
- Enyinnah Okere, chief operating officer of Edmonton Police Service’s bureau for community safety and well-being, said his team commissioned the profile to advance the case in lieu of tips, leads and ultimately justice for the victim — a young woman left unconscious and nearly naked in -27 C weather.
- 
- “But we were not and are not oblivious to the legitimate questions raised about the suitability of this type of technology,” Okere told media at a Downtown news conference Thursday. “The potential that a visual profile can provide far too broad a characterization from within a racialized community — and in this case, Edmonton’s Black community — was not something I adequately considered.”
- 
- Community members criticized the “broadness” of the image and expressed concerns that it stigmatizes and criminalizes racialized groups, he said.
- 
- Okere also said police decided to release the image after the technology had been used to generate leads in other jurisdictions.
- 
- Parabon Nanolabs, the U.S. DNA technology company that produced the visual profile, boasts that its “snapshot genetic genealogy” has helped identify more than 230 persons of interest since it started offering the service in May 2018. As of Thursday afternoon, the snapshot generated for Edmonton police was still available on the company’s list of investigations.
- 
- However, a 2019 article in Deutsches Ärzteblatt International, the German Medical Association’s official international science journal, reports several concerns around forensic DNA phenotyping, such as discrimination against minority groups, invasion of privacy and exaggerated expectations from both users and the general public.
- 
- “Many experts see the greatest problem in the risk that forensic DNA phenotyping will be used in a way that discriminates against minority groups, particularly in societies where racism and xenophobia are now on the rise,” the article reported, adding that even supporters of the technology recognize it shouldn’t be used in police investigations before appropriate measures are in place to ensure it’s used transparently and proportionately.
- 
- “The training of forensic DNA experts and investigators is essential to ensure that the laboratory findings are correctly generated, interpreted, documented, and transmitted to the investigating authorities, and that the authorities understand them correctly and use them properly,” the article said.
- 
- Police Chief Dale McFee, who was also present at the conference, said while the technology was deployed for the “right reasons,” namely to generate leads, the image could end up confusing the investigation.
- 
- “Unfortunately, that describes way too many people in our community,” McFee said of the image, adding that a police investigation also requires a significant amount of subject matter expertise before an arrest.
- 
- Okere said Edmonton Police Service will review its processes to ensure its tools for informing future decisions to ensure they are “appropriate, robust and stress-tested.”

- For the first time, the Edmonton Police Service has used DNA phenotyping in the hopes of identifying a suspect in a violent 2019 sexual assault.
- After a lengthy investigation with no witnesses, and as “a last resort,” the EPS enlisted an American DNA technology company that specializes in advanced DNA analysis services. The company used DNA phenotyping to produce a “snapshot” composite sketch of the approximate appearance of the suspect based on DNA.
- DNA phenotyping is the process of predicting physical appearance and ancestry from unidentified DNA evidence, the EPS explained. Law enforcement agencies use the company’s Snapshot DNA Phenotyping Service to narrow suspect lists and generate leads in criminal investigations.
- The case in question dates back to March 10, 2019, when police said a woman was found yelling for help in the area of 103 Street and 114 Avenue at around 5:45 a.m. A woman in her mid-20s was found seriously injured and wearing only a shirt, according to police.
- Police said the woman was walking north on the west side of 101 Street between 2:30 a.m. and 5 a.m. There were a number of people at a nearby bus shelter who were picked up by a bus as she walked by. Police said after the bus left, an unknown man who was at the bus stop followed the woman as she carried on walking.
- Police said the man allegedly assaulted the woman, then pulled her into the field near St. Basil and Spruce Avenue schools where he violently sexually assaulted her.
- “She was just walking home and this suspect just randomly attacked her. It was a very violent occurrence where she was left in the middle of a field, in the snow, it was -27 C that night,’ said Det. Colleen Maynes with the EPS sexual assault section.
- “She sustained quite a few injuries and quite serious injuries.”
- Police said when the woman regained consciousness, she made her way to the area of 103 Street and 114 Avenue where a resident found her and called 911.
- In April 2019, police put out a plea to the public in hopes of identifying the suspect, whom police described as standing five feet four inches and wearing a black toque, pants and a sweater or hoodie at the time of the incident.
- Police said there were no witnesses, CCTV footage, public tips or DNA matches in the case. Because the suspect was wearing heavy winter clothing, police said the woman was only able to provide a limited description of the suspect.
- In what police call a “last resort” after exhausting all other investigative avenues, they enlisted the services of Parabon NanoLabs in Virginia.
- Using DNA evidence, the company produced trait predictions for the man’s ancestry, eye colour, hair colour, skin colour, freckling and face shape.
- By combining these attributes of appearance, a composite sketch was created, showing what the suspect may have looked like at 25 years old with an average body mass index of 22. Police said the default values were used because age and BMI cannot be determined by DNA.
- “It is important to note that DNA phenotyping composites are scientific approximations of appearance based on DNA, and are not likely to be exact replicas of appearance,” the EPS said in a news release Tuesday.
- “Environmental factors such as smoking, drinking, diet and other non-environmental factors — facial hair, hairstyle, scars, etc. — cannot be predicted by DNA analysis and may cause further variation between the subject’s predicted and actual appearances.”
- Police said the suspect may be older, have different body composition and may have facial hair or a different hairstyle than shown in the composite sketch.
- “This is essentially a last resort after all other investigative avenues have been exhausted,” said Maynes. “It is by no means an immediate path to accusing a suspect. What it does is potentially give us leads in a cold case, and we can follow up with DNA testing from there.”
- Maynes said she was pushed to do the DNA phenotyping because she believed she tried everything else that was available to them.
- “It’s not 100 per cent accurate but it at least gives us something to work with to generate leads and tips,” she said. “The public needs to get this person off the street so this offence doesn’t happen again.”
- In a statement, Parabon NanoLabs said since May 2018, its snapshot division has helped agencies throughout North America solve 230 violent crime cases.
- Doug King, a professor of justice studies at Mount Royal University, believes the technology can be a useful tool. However, he added when it comes to the use of any new technology, the benefits of using it have to outweigh any potential risks.
- “We see the composite picture and then we automatically then assume it’s an accurate composite picture,” King said.
- “By putting a composite together we fix it in people’s minds that this is what the person is supposed to look like. So you have to guard against that because then the issue becomes, ‘I see someone who looks like that — my next door neighbour.’ And it turns out it has nothing to do with that person.”
- King said some of the benefits of using the technology include narrowing down a list of suspects in any given crime. Or in this case, building a list of potential suspects. One of the risks comes if the composite isn’t particularly accurate.
- “If the composite isn’t all that accurate, you can run into the notion of racial profiling, particularly when the profile is a person of colour,” King said.
- In its news release, the EPS said “following consultation with community stakeholders, the EPS is aware of the impact this release may have on a marginalized community.
- “Due to the severity of the occurrence, the need to advocate for a victim of a violent sexual assault and in consideration of the public safety interest, investigators believe the release of this image based on DNA evidence is required in order to further the investigation. As always, any leads generated from the release of a composite image would require further investigative steps.”
- “It’s great that they reached out, but it still has to meet the standard of the criminal justice system and our relationship with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,” King explained. “I respect police officers and I’ll take them at their word, but sometimes they don’t see the issues through the right lens. So we always have to be a little bit skeptical.
- “In a court of law, to bring charges, you have to have more than mere suspicion. Right now, if the phenotype leads them to a particular group of individuals, it still relies on more police work. They have to go from suspicion to actual physical evidence.”
- EPS spokesperson Cheryl Voordenhout said the technology is also being used with missing persons cases and with helping identify unidentified human remains.
- Anyone with information can contact the EPS at 780-423-4567 or #377 from a mobile phone. Anonymous information can be submitted to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or online.

- Black-led agencies are calling on Edmonton police to stop using controversial DNA technology that they say demonizes and alienates vulnerable community members.
- Earlier this month, police apologized for circulating a generic image of a Black suspect in a 2019 sexual assault cold case but the service won't rule out using the technology that generated it.
- Phenotyping technology aims to predict physical appearance and ancestry using unidentified DNA evidence. It's a controversial practice questioned by genetic scientist
- "It is troubling to issue a generic image that renders large numbers of Black males suspect," states the letter sent to police commissioner John McDougall on Tuesday by the Africa Centre and seven other organizations including African Canadian Civic Engagement Council and Black Women United.
- "Our community feels traumatized, scapegoated and humiliated. An incident that demonizes and alienates the most vulnerable individuals and families of our community. The practice deepens historical mistrust and lowers confidence in our policing."
- DNA-assisted mug shots in law enforcement are based on dubious science. So why would Edmonton police use them?
- At a police commission meeting Thursday, police said the service has only used the technology once, as a last resort in a violent sexual assault case.
- "This is a Hail Mary for a woman that was left for dead … that's the lens that I'm using when I'm making that decision," said Enyinnah Okere, chief operating officer for the Edmonton Police Service's community safety and well-being bureau.
- Okere once again acknowledged the "unintended harm that came with the release of a highly generalized, computer-generated image."
- He said police are updating their ethics review process to ensure the use of technology is in the interest of public safety on a case-by-case basis.
- When asked, police were not able to provide data showing the success rate of the technology but said the release of the image had generated leads that could advance the case.
- The validity of those leads was put into question by activist Haruun Ali, who spoke at the meeting.
- He pointed to a photo posted on social media that juxtaposed an image of himself with the image released by police.
- "You can take any random Black man that you know, put him next to it and to be frank,  it will probably look similar to them," Ali said.
- "This is modern-day racial profiling."
- Commissioner Jodi Calahoo Stonehouse said the commission must come up with policy and legislation to protect citizens and their constitutional rights while using technology responsibly.
- "Sexualized violence against Indigenous women is disproportionate to non-Indigenous women and so when we see a tool that potentially can hold men who cause and who perpetrate against women accountable to their behaviours, that's an opportunity for justice," she said.
- Commissioners passed a unanimous motion directing police to provide a proposal for a committee that assesses the use of current and future technologies.
- In a statement to CBC, Edmonton Mayor Amarjeet Sohi called on Edmonton police to abandon the use of phenotyping technology as an investigative technique.
- All organizations funded by the city should approach everything they do with an "anti-racist lens," Sohi said.
- "The use of the unproven phenotyping technology in this case has led to unintended consequences for racialized people, specifically the Black community," Sohi said in the statement Thursday.
- "I am concerned about the effect it had on marginalized communities. I was pleased to see EPS apologized to Edmontonians following their concerns about the technology and I hope that it, or any other technology that could negatively impact marginalized communities is never used now or in the future."
