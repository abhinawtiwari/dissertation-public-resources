- Story at a glance
- A week after laying off dozens of journalists and editorial workers and replacing them with artificial intelligence, Microsoft’s robot editor confused two members of the British singing group Little Mix, who are both mixed-race.
- Singer Jade Thirlwall first called out the mistake on her Instagram story tagging MSN, where a story about her experience with racism was paired with a photo of singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock.
- “@MSN If you’re going to copy and paste articles from other accurate media outlets, you might want to make sure you’re using an image of the correct mixed race member of the group,” she wrote, adding, “This s— happens to @leighannepinnock and I ALL THE TIME that it’s become a running joke…It offends me that you couldn’t differentiate the two women of colour out of four members of a group…DO BETTER!”

- The article “Little Mix star Jade Thirlwall says she faced horrific racism at school” drew from an interview the 27-year-old gave on the BBC podcast “No Country for Young Women.” Thirlwall, whose mother is Egyptian and Yemeni and father is English, spoke about being bullied for her heritage growing up.
- Pinnock, who has Barbadian and Jamaican ancestry, later called out the mistake on her own social media.
- 
- It’s really disrespectful. Is it so hard to remember 2 out of 4 members of the group ? I don’t think so…We are worth more. If you want us to respect you, do the same. https://t.co/K91mUuCQKf

- A spokesman for Microsoft, which owns MSN, told the Guardian, “As soon as we became aware of this issue, we immediately took action to resolve it and have replaced the incorrect image.”
- In a previous story about the move to replace human editors with Microsoft’s artificial intelligence software, The Guardian reported former staff members’ concerns over potential mistakes like this one. A Guardian reporter later said on Twitter that unnamed staff members at MSN were ordered to remove The Guardian article on the mix-up once it was published.
- 
- As predicted: Soon after we published a story about Microsoft’s misfiring artificial intelligence editor, the robot journalist copied the story about itself from the Guardian onto MSN’s system. Human staff have now intervened to override the software and delete the article.

- Microsoft’s decision to replace human journalists with robots has backfired, after the tech company’s artificial intelligence software illustrated a news story about racism with a photo of the wrong mixed-race member of the band Little Mix.
- A week after the Guardian revealed plans to fire the human editors who run MSN.com and replace them with Microsoft’s artificial intelligence code, an early rollout of the software resulted in a story about the singer Jade Thirlwall’s personal reflections on racism being illustrated with a picture of her fellow band member Leigh-Anne Pinnock.
- Thirlwall, who attended a recent Black Lives Matter protest in London, criticised MSN on Friday, saying she was sick of “ignorant” media making such mistakes. She posted on Instagram: “@MSN If you’re going to copy and paste articles from other accurate media outlets, you might want to make sure you’re using an image of the correct mixed race member of the group.”
- “This shit happens to @leighannepinnock and I ALL THE TIME that it’s become a running joke,” she said. “It offends me that you couldn’t differentiate the two women of colour out of four members of a group ... DO BETTER!”

- What Thirlwall could not have known, according to sources at the company, is that the image was selected by Microsoft’s artificial intelligence software, which is already responsible for editing parts of the news site, which attracts hundreds of millions of readers worldwide.
- Microsoft does not carry out original reporting but employs human editors to select, edit and repurpose articles from news outlets. Articles are then hosted on Microsoft's website and the tech company shares advertising revenue with the original publishers. At the end of last month, Microsoft decided to fire hundreds of journalists in the middle of a pandemic and fully replace them with the artificial intelligence software.
- Asked why Microsoft was deploying software that cannot tell mixed-race individuals apart, whether apparent racist bias could seep into deployments of the company’s artificial intelligence software by leading corporations, and whether the company would reconsider plans to replace the human editors with robots, a spokesman for the tech company said: “As soon as we became aware of this issue, we immediately took action to resolve it and have replaced the incorrect image.”
- In advance of the publication of this article, staff at MSN were told to expect a negative article in the Guardian about alleged racist bias in the artificial intelligence software that will soon take their jobs.
- Because they are unable to stop the new robot editor selecting stories from external news sites, the remaining human staff have been told to stay alert and delete a version of this article if the robot decides it is of interest and automatically publishes it on MSN.com. They have also been warned that even if they delete it, the robot editor may overrule them and attempt to publish it again.
- Staff have already had to delete coverage criticising MSN for running the story about Little Mix with the wrong image after the AI software decided stories about the incident would interest MSN readers.
- One staff member said Microsoft was deeply concerned about reputational damage to its AI product: “With all the anti-racism protests at the moment, now is not the time to be making mistakes.” –Guardian

- By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge.
- Microsoft’s decision to replace human journalists with AI to run its news and search site MSN.com has been criticized after the automated system confused two mixed-race members of British pop group Little Mix.
- As first reported by The Guardian, the newly-instated robot editors of MSN.com selected a story about Little Mix singer Jade Thirlwall’s experience with racism to appear on the homepage, but used a picture of Thirlwall’s bandmate Leigh-Anne Pinnock to illustrate it.
- Thirlwall drew attention to the mistake on her Instagram story, writing: “@MSN If you’re going to copy and paste articles from other accurate media outlets, you might want to make sure you’re using an image of the correct mixed race member of the group.”
- She added: “This shit happens to @leighannepinnock and I ALL THE TIME that it’s become a running joke ... It offends me that you couldn’t differentiate the two women of colour out of four members of a group … DO BETTER!”
- According to The Guardian, the mistake was made by Microsoft’s new automated systems. The tech giant laid off the editorial staff of MSN late last month. These journalists were not tasked with writing stories, but selecting articles from other outlets to spotlight on the MSN homepage. Around 50 journalists were reportedly let go in the US and 27 in the UK.
- It’s not clear exactly what caused this error, but in an updated statement, Microsoft said it was not a result of algorithmic bias but an experimental feature in the automated system.
- A spokesperson told The Verge: “Whilst removing bias and improving accuracy remain an area of focus for AI research, this mistake was not a result of these issues. In testing a new feature to select an alternate image, rather than defaulting to the first photo, a different image on the page of the original article was paired with the headline of the piece. This made it erroneously appear as though the headline was a caption for the picture.”
- However, this is exactly the sort of mistake human editors are supposed to spot. Though, as Thirlwall’s comments make clear, this is far from the first time such errors have been made. Earlier this year, for example, the BBC was forced to apologize after using footage of basketball player LeBron James to illustrate news of the death of Kobe Bryant, both of whom played for the Lakers at different periods of time.
- Notably, The Guardian reports that the remaining human staff at MSN have been warned that critical coverage of the site’s automated systems is being published by news outlets. The staff were told that the AI may select these stories as interesting and place them on the MSN homepage. If this happens the human staff have been told to remove the stories.
- Update Jun 10th, 5:59AM ET: The story has been updated with a new statement from Microsoft.
- Correction: The story previously described Kobe Bryant and LeBron James as “teammates.” Although they played for the same team it was not at the same time.

- Hey, at least Microsoft's news-curating artificial intelligence doesn't have an ego. That much was made clear today after the company's news app(opens in a new tab) highlighted Microsoft's most recent racist failure.
- The inciting incident for this entire debacle appears to be Microsoft's late May decision(opens in a new tab) to fire some human editors and journalists responsible for MSN.com and have its AI curate and aggregate stories for the site instead. Following that move, The Guardian(opens in a new tab) reported(opens in a new tab) earlier today that Microsoft's AI confused two members of the pop band Little Mix, who both happen to be women of color, in a republished story originally reported by The Independent. Then, after being called out by band member Jade Thirlwall for the screwup, the AI then published stories about its own failing.
- So, to recap: Microsoft's AI made a racist error while aggregating another outlet's reporting, got called out for doing so, and then elevated the coverage of its own outing. Notably, this is after Microsoft's human employees were reportedly told(opens in a new tab) to manually remove stories about the Little Mix incident from MSN.com.
- Still with me?
- "This shit happens to @leighannepinnock and I ALL THE TIME that it's become a running joke," Thirlwall reportedly wrote in an Instagram story, which is no longer visible on her account, about the incident. "It offends me that you couldn't differentiate the two women of colour out of four members of a group … DO BETTER!"
- As of the time of this writing, a quick search on the Microsoft News app shows at least one such story remains.
- Notably, Guardian editor Jim Waterson spotted several more examples before they were apparently pulled.
- "Microsoft's artificial intelligence news app is now swamped with stories selected by the news robot about the news robot backfiring," he wrote on Twitter(opens in a new tab).
- We reached out to Microsoft in an attempt to determine just what, exactly, the hell is going on over there. According to a company spokesperson, the problem is not one of AI gone wrong. No, of course not. It's not like machine learning has a long history of bias (oh, wait). Instead, the spokesperson insisted, the issue was simply that Microsoft's AI selected the wrong photo for the initial article in question.
- "In testing a new feature to select an alternate image, rather than defaulting to the first photo, a different image on the page of the original article was paired with the headline of the piece," wrote the spokesperson in an email. "This made it erroneously appear as though the headline was a caption for the picture. As soon as we became aware of this issue, we immediately took action to resolve it, replaced the incorrect image and turned off this new feature."
- Unfortunately, the spokesperson did not respond to our question about human Microsoft employees deleting coverage of the initial AI error from Microsoft's news platforms.
- Microsoft has a troubled recent history when it comes to artificial intelligence and race. In 2016, the company released a social media chatbot dubbed Tay. In under a day, the chatbot began publishing racist statements. The company subsequently pulled Tay offline, attempted to release an updated version, and then had to pull it offline again.
- As evidenced today by the ongoing debacle with its own news-curating AI, Microsoft still has some work to do — both in the artificial intelligence and not-being-racist departments.

- Your guide to a better future
- "You might want to make sure you're using an image of the correct mixed race member of the group," Little Mix member Jade Thirlwall reportedly says.
- Microsoft's MSN.com is facing criticism after artificial intelligence software used to run some tasks on the news and search site reportedly had trouble distinguishing between two mixed-race band members of the British female pop group Little Mix. The reported mix-up comes after Microsoft last month replaced several human journalists with AI editors.
- The Guardian spotted this Instagram Stories post by Thirlwall.
- According to a Tuesday report in The Guardian, the AI software at MSN.com chose to republish and feature a story originally published by The Independent, about Little Mix singer Jade Thirlwall and her experience with racism. But instead of illustrating the story with a picture of Thirlwall, the AI software used an image of bandmate Leigh-Anne Pinnock. Both Thirlwall and Pinnock are women of color.
- "@MSN if you're going to copy and paste articles from other accurate media outlets, you might want to make sure you're using an image of the correct mixed race member of the group," Thirlwall said in an Instagram Stories post spotted by The Guardian. "This shit happens to @leighannepinnock and I ALL THE TIME that it's become a running joke ... It offends me that you couldn't differentiate the two women of color out of four members of a group ... DO BETTER!"
- A Microsoft spokesperson said the incorrect image was fixed as soon as the company became aware of the issue. The spokesperson wouldn't say whether AI software was responsible for the error.
- The AI journalists reportedly do work similar to that of their human counterparts, including spotting trending news stories, changing headlines, finding photos to accompany stories and managing the website's editorial calendar.
- CelebrityAgent, the talent agency that represents Thirlwall, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
- Studies have shown that facial recognition systems have a harder time identifying women and darker-skinned people, a situation that's led to concern among rights groups, lawmakers and others.

- Opinion: Microsoft can't get away with such avoidable errors
- With a global pandemic keeping us pretty occupied for the past few months, you may have allowed yourself to forget about that other apocalyptic danger – that is, unchecked artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, an AI program being put to use at Microsoft's MSN.com has brought it back into the spotlight.
- The story centers on an article published on MSN.com about Little Mix star Jade Thirlwall, incorrectly using a photo of another mixed-race band member, Leigh-Anne Pinnock.
- This would be bad enough a mistake for a human editor to make – not just because of its terrible timing amid worldwide protests against racial injustice – but it takes on a whole new flavor when the automated processes behind this article come to light.
- MSN.com doesn’t do its own reporting, preferring to repurpose articles from across the web and split resulting ad revenue with the original publisher, whose piece has been able to reach a wider audience. It may not be surprising, then, that Microsoft thought a lot of this process could be automated – not only sacking hundreds of staff during a pandemic, but also implementing an AI editor that automatically published news stories on MSN.com without any human oversight.
- Racial bias in AI is a well-documented issue, with the huge data sets used to train artificial intelligence software often seeing those programs duplicate human prejudices – which, under the uneasy guise of algorithmic ‘objectivity’ can easily go overlooked by AI-focused organizations. (For a truly dystopian example, check out this psychotic AI trained with data sets from Reddit.)
- But this error shows what can happen when an unfeeling AI is trusted with editorial oversight, something that requires empathy beyond an algorithmic sense of reader interest.
- According to Microsoft, the issue wasn't in facial recognition so much as the AI reordering photos from the original article: "In testing a new feature to select an alternate image, rather than defaulting to the first photo, a different image on the page of the original article was paired with the headline of the piece. This made it erroneously appear as though the headline was a caption for the picture."
- The most disconcerting thing about this story, though, is the extent of the role that Microsoft felt comfortable giving to an AI – with the ability to automatically publish stories without human curation, meaning no-one had the chance to prevent this mistake before it reached MSN.com’s readership.
- We’ve also learned that, while human staff – a term we can’t believe we’re having to use – were quick to delete the article, the AI still had the ability to overrule them and publish the same story again. In fact, that’s basically what happened – with the AI auto-sharing news articles concerning its own errors, viewing them as relevant to MSN.com readers.
- When contacted, a Microsoft rep relied that, “As soon as we became aware of this issue, we immediately took action to resolve it and have replaced the incorrect image.” We've yet to hear anything about these AI processes changing, though.
- While AI software may seem like a handy replacement for newsroom roles, we’ve seen that AI applications aren’t ready to take editorial responsibility away from human hands – and attempting to rush to an AI-driven future is only going to hurt the reputation of both Microsoft and online reporting further.

- Microsoft’s decision to replace human editors with artificial intelligence (AI) has caused more controversy after its AI technology confused images of two mixed-race members of Little Mix.
- At the end of last month, news emerged of the company’s plans to introduce its AI code in place of MSN.com staff who were in charge of selecting, editing and repurposing articles from other news outlets before sharing them to site.
- Shortly after an early rollout of the software was put in place, MSN posted a story about singer Jade Thirlwall and her personal experiences with racism. However, the image illustrating the article showed her fellow Little Mix member, Leigh-Anne Pinnock.

- A post shared by  Little Mix (@littlemix) on May 17, 2020 at 4:38am PDT
- 
- Both Jade and Leigh-Anne are mixed-race, and after seeing MSN’s blunder Jade took to social media to criticise the outlet.
- In a post on Instagram, she wrote:
- @MSN If you’re going to copy and paste articles from other accurate media outlets, you might want to make sure you’re using an image of the correct mixed race member of the group.
- This sh*t happens to @leighannepinnock and I ALL THE TIME that it’s become a running joke. It offends me that you couldn’t differentiate the two women of colour out of four members of a group … DO BETTER!
- According to sources from Microsoft, cited by The Guardian, the image used in the article had been selected by the AI software. The news outlet fired a number of its staff towards the end of last month in the hopes they could be replaced by the electronic system, though the failings in the AI are evident.
- A spokesperson commented:
- As soon as we became aware of this issue, we immediately took action to resolve it and have replaced the incorrect image.
- MSN does not post original articles, but hosts pieces repurposed from other outlets and shares advertising revenue with the original publishers. As staff are unable to stop the AI system from selecting certain stories, the remain human workers have been told to stay alert and delete any content they don’t want on site.
- One staff member apparently revealed Microsoft was deeply concerned about potential damage to the reputation of its AI product, saying:
- With all the anti-racism protests at the moment, now is not the time to be making mistakes.

- 
- It’s not exactly clear why the AI system selected the wrong picture for the Jade’s story – it could potentially have been down to faulty facial recognition or incorrect labelling of the photo – but needless to say the mistakes aren’t excusable.
