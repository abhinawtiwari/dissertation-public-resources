- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating a "violent" crash that involved a Tesla sedan and a tractor trailer late last week in Detroit. Investigators have not yet said whether Tesla's Autopilot, FSD or FSD beta may have contributed to the crash.
- The NHTSA said Monday in a statement, "NHTSA is aware of the violent crash that occurred on March 11 in Detroit involving a Tesla and a tractor trailer. We have launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash." Reuters previously reported the probe.
- The Detroit police department said in an email that the crash happened when a Tesla piloted by "an unknown male driver" hit a semi-truck and "became wedged under the trailer." A passenger in the car is in critical condition, and the circumstances of the accident still under investigation.
- The NHTSA has previously embarked on probes into more than a dozen crashes that were thought to involve Tesla's advanced driver assist systems.
- These systems include Tesla's standard Autopilot package, and a more advanced option marketed as Full Self-Driving, which is sold today for $10,000. The company's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (or FSD) technology do not make Tesla vehicles safe for operation without a driver at the wheel. Some customers who purchase the FSD option also get access to a "beta" version to try the newest features that are being added to the system before all bugs are worked out.
- Investigators have not yet said whether any of these systems were in use during or just before the March 11 crash in Detroit. However, Tesla vehicles with Autopilot have collided with stationary objects and large vehicles, including tractor trailers and fire trucks, on multiple occasions.
- A 50-year-old, Jeremy Beren Banner of Lake Worth, Florida, died when his Model 3 on Autopilot struck the side of a semi-trailer in Florida on March 1, 2019, resulting in the roof of his car being sheared off as it passed underneath.
- Tesla's Autopilot system, while it has changed significantly over the years, has been a subject of regulatory scrutiny since 2016 when an owner named Joshua Brown died driving his Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged around Gainsville, Florida. The vehicle also collided with a tractor trailer.
- Another federal vehicle safety watchdog that gives recommendations to NHTSA, the National Transportation Safety Board, recently called for clear and stringent rules for automated driving systems at a federal level. The board has pointed to Tesla's approach to automated driving systems as a reason why stronger safety requirements and clear regulation are needed.

- WASHINGTON – The U.S. auto safety agency said on Monday it is investigating a crash in Detroit on Thursday involving a Tesla that became wedged underneath a tractor-trailer and left a passenger in critical condition.
- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Monday it is “aware of the violent crash that occurred on March 11 in Detroit involving a Tesla and a tractor trailer. We have launched a Special Crash Investigation (SCI) team to investigate the crash.”
- The crash occured at 3:20 a.m. Thursday when a white Tesla drove through an intersection and struck a trailer, Detroit police said Monday.
- Both the driver and the passenger were taken to a local hospital, where the passenger was listed in critical condition. Police said the crash is still under investigation.
- WDIV-TV in Detroit aired video of a badly damaged Tesla crushed underneath a tractor-trailer and said the injured passenger was a 21-year-old woman.
- 
- NHTSA has previously launched around at least 14 SCI teams to investigate Tesla crashes that may be tied to the vehicle’s advanced Autopilot driver assistance system, but taken no action against the automaker as a result of those probes.
- It is not clear if Autopilot may have been a factor in the Detroit crash.
- Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
- Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016.
- NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board have probed other crashes in which a Tesla struck a trailer, including two fatal crashes in Florida.
- In a 2019 crash, a Tesla struck a tractor trailer and the roof was sheared off as it passed underneath the trailer and stopped three-tenths of a mile south of the collision. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene.
- In May 2016, a Tesla Model S driver was killed near Williston, Florida, using Autopilot when he slammed into a tractor trailer that also sheared off the vehicle roof.

- Photo (c) AdrianHancu - Getty ImagesThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating a crash in Detroit involving a Tesla vehicle that may have been in Autopilot mode. The vehicle reportedly drove beneath a semitrailer, critically injuring two people. Local police say they’re still investigating whether the driver was using the Autopilot feature or not.
- The agency called the incident a “violent crash,” one eerily similar to two previous crashes in Florida in which Teslas drove beneath tractor-trailers, causing two fatalities. In one of those, the regulators found that the Tesla Autopilot was not at fault.
- In both Florida crashes, the vehicles were being driven with the assistance of Tesla’s Autopilot feature, which is a partially automated driving software. When the company first released Autopilot, it said the feature was designed to “give you more confidence behind the wheel, increase your safety on the road, and make highway driving more enjoyable.”
- However, that was six years and several accidents ago. Now, the company has scaled back its language to say that Autopilot is “a hands-on driver assistance system that is intended to be used only with a fully attentive driver,” adding that it “does not turn a Tesla into a self-driving car nor does it make a car autonomous.”
- In its investigation of previous Tesla Autopilot-related crashes, the National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) cited the shortcomings of these new automotive technologies. “This tragic crash clearly demonstrates the limitations of advanced driver assistance systems available to consumers today,” said NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt.
- “There is not a vehicle currently available to U.S. consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to US consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when advanced driver assistance systems are activated. If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you’re not selling a self-driving car. If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don’t own a self-driving car,” Sumwalt said.
- Sumwalt recently went after the NHTSA for its “continued failure to recognize the importance of ensuring that acceptable safeguards are in place” when it comes to testing advanced driver assistance systems. He said conditions like roadway type, geographic location, clear roadway markings, weather conditions, speed range, and lighting conditions can all hinder the ability of these systems to operate safely.
- Despite these limitations, Sumwalt pointed out in a February 1 letter to the Department of Transportation that vehicle manufacturers can operate and test vehicles virtually anywhere. He said that’s only possible because the NHTSA has no requirements in place.
- Sumwalt cited Tesla’s recent beta version of its Level 2 Autopilot system, which is described as having full self-driving capability, as an example.
- “By releasing the system, Tesla is testing on public roads a highly [automated vehicle] technology but with limited oversight or reporting requirements. Although Tesla includes a disclaimer that ‘currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous,’ NHTSA’s hands-off approach to oversight of AV testing poses a potential risk to motorists and other road users,” he said.

- The US government’s highway safety agency is sending a team to Detroit to investigate a crash involving a Tesla that drove beneath a semitrailer.
- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says Monday night that a special crash investigation team will go to the city to investigate the “violent crash.” Two people were critically injured in the crash that happened last Thursday on the city’s southwest side.
- The crash circumstances are similar to two others in Florida in which Teslas drove beneath tractor-trailers, causing two deaths. In both crashes, in 2016 and 2019, the cars were being driven while using Tesla’s Autopilot partially automated driving software.
- Detroit Police Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood could not say if the Tesla driver was using the company’s Autopilot or “full self-driving” software. “It’s still under investigation,” she said.
- A message was left Monday night seeking comment from Tesla. The Palo Alto, California-based company has said previously that Autopilot and “full self-driving” are driver-assistance systems and that the driver must be ready to intervene at all times.
- But the company has been criticized by the National Transportation Safety Board for failing to adequately monitor drivers to make sure they are paying attention. The NTSB, which investigates crashes and makes recommendations, also criticized Tesla for allowing the system to work on roads that it can’t handle.
- In a Feb. 1 letter to the Department of Transportation, which includes NHTSA, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt urged the agency to enact regulations governing driver assist systems as well as testing of autonomous vehicles. NHTSA has relied mainly on voluntary guidelines for the vehicles, taking a hands-off approach so it won’t hinder development of new safety technology.
- He wrote that Tesla is using its owners to test “full self-driving” software on public roads with limited oversight or reporting requirements. “Because NHTSA has put in place no requirements, manufacturers can operate and test vehicles virtually anywhere, even if the location exceeds the AV (autonomous vehicle) control system’s limitations,” Sumwalt wrote.
- “Although Tesla includes a disclaimer that ‘currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous,’ NHTSA’s hands-off approach to oversight of AV testing poses a potential risk to motorists and other road users,” he wrote.
- Detroit police said in a statement that a white Tesla sedan drove through an intersection around 3:20 a.m. Thursday, struck the trailer and became wedged beneath it.
- Both the male driver and female passenger were taken to a local hospital. The woman was in critical condition Thursday, while the driver’s condition was not immediately known. Police said the information was preliminary and subject to change upon further investigation.

- The nation’s chief safety regulator is looking into a crash last week in which a Tesla ran into a tractor trailer leaving a passenger critically injured.
- The accident occurred in Detroit on March 11 at about 3:20 a.m.
- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posted Monday on its web site that it has assigned a special crash investigation team to look into the collision.
- A Detroit television station ran video showing the severely damaged Tesla that was crushed beneath the truck. The male driver and a 21-year-old woman passenger were taken to a local hospital and the passenger is listed in critical condition. The driver’s condition is unknown.
- Before this, NHTSA has opened more than a dozen investigations of accidents in which a Tesla crash may have been related to the company’s Autopilot driver assist technology. None of those inquiries has resulted in any citation or finding of fault against the electric vehicle manufacturer.
- Nicole Kirkwood, a sergeant with the Detroit Police Department, could not say if the driver had engaged the Autopilot system.
- The National Transportation Safety Board has called out Tesla for failing to adequately monitor drivers to make sure they are paying attention when such driver assist features are engaged.
- The company has stated that the Autopilot system and what it calls “full self-driving” do not eliminate the driver’s need to pay attention and be prepared to take control.
- Over the last four years, there have been three Teslas
TSLA
 involved in fatal crashes during which the Autopilot system was engaged.
- NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board have investigated other crashes in which Teslas have become wedged beneath tractor-trailer trucks.
- In 2019, a Tesla ran into a truck and the roof was sheared off as the car kept on going on the other side of the truck. The driver died.
- Last month, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt wrote in a letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation, which oversees both NHTSA and NTSB, that the agency establish regulations governing driver assist systems and the testing of autonomous vehicles.
- So far NHTSA has left it to automakers to develop guidelines.
- “Because NHTSA has put in place no requirements, manufacturers can operate and test vehicles virtually anywhere, even if the location exceeds the autonomous control system’s limitations,” Sumwalt wrote. The letter was dated Feb. 1, one day before the U.S. Senate confirmed Pete Buttigieg as Transportation Secretary.
- Buttigieg replaced Elaine Chao, who resigned during the final week of the administration of former President Donald Trump.
