- The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has been testing the collection and analysis of traveller biometrics, including fingerprints and facial images, since 2013.
- A February 2021 OneZero report based on the CPB's 2020 annual report (pdf), showed the agency failed to turn up a single example of an individual impersonating someone else at an airport, despite using facial recognition to scan 23+ million travelers’ faces at 30+ points of entry in 2020.
- The findings, OneZero's Dave Gershorn concludes, 'would seem to suggest that either there are very few imposters using fake credentials to enter the U.S. or that the CBP system is very ineffective at finding them.'
- Techdirt's Tim Cushing notes, 'Spending millions to deal with a minor problem by deploying tech that remains unproven shouldn’t be considered acceptable. Neither is the alternative: a system that rarely recognizes imposters, allowing government agencies to assume it’s less of a problem than it might actually be.
- In a September 2020 report (pdf), the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) took issue with the CPB over lackluster accuracy audits, poor signage notifying the public the technology is being used, and the paucity of public information on how its systems worked.

- U.S. Customs and Border Protection Statement for the Record for a July 27, 2022, hearing on, "Assessing CBP's Use of Facial Recognition Technology," before the House Committee on Homeland Security, Subcommittee on Border Security, Facilitation and Operations.
- U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) submits this statement for the record regarding CBP’s use of biometric identification capabilities as part of our efforts to secure our borders and facilitate lawful travel.
- The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is statutorily mandated to develop and implement an integrated, automated entry and exit data system to match records, including biographic data and biometrics, of noncitizens entering and departing the United States. For travelers arriving by air, DHS/CBP have collected fingerprints and photos of travelers’ faces for in-scope noncitizens1 during the primary inspection since 2004.
- Since taking over entry and exit operations in 2013,2 CBP has been testing various options to collect biometrics at arrival and departure. The results of these tests and the recent advancement of biometric facial recognition technology have provided CBP with a model for moving forward with implementing a comprehensive biometric exit solution.
- CBP’s biometric facial comparison technology standardizes, automates, and enhances manual processes by making them more efficient, accurate, and secure. The Traveler Verification Service (TVS) is the cloud-based, facial biometric matching service that is the foundation for CBP’s biometric verification processes at U.S. ports of entry (POE).
- TVS uses a high performing facial biometric algorithm to compare a live photo of the traveler against photographs from passports, U.S. visas, or photographs from other DHS holdings. Using data that travelers are already required by statute3 to provide, the automated identity verification process uses biometric facial comparison to verify identity and swiftly and accurately confirm others who may be inadmissible including those who have overstayed their authorized period of admission.
- To ensure TVS continues to use the highest performing algorithm, CBP engages with testing, research, and evaluation activities performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)4 and the DHS Science and Technology Directorate. Furthermore, CBP continuously monitors its biometric matching service and conducts a variety of statistical tests and manual evaluations to gauge algorithm results and ensure optimal accuracy and performance.
- CBP is aware of concerns regarding biometric facial comparison matching, specifically that non-match results may be racially or demographically biased in performance. CBP does not track race as a descriptor during traveler processing; however, CBP data analysts have performed extensive operational analytics on TVS matching that shows a negligible effect in regard to biometric matching based on country of citizenship, age, or gender while achieving an average technical match rate of 99.4 percent on entry and 98.1 percent on exit.5 No changes have been necessary as the matching performance has remained consistent for several years across multiple matching algorithms. From January 2017 through the end of June 2022, technical match rates remained high among citizens from various regions of the globe, for example: Africa 99.5 percent match rate; Asia 99.3 percent match rate; Central America 99.6 percent match rate; and Europe 99.6 percent match rate. If a traveler cannot be matched by CBP’s biometric facial comparison technology, the traveler will simply be processed through the traditional inspection process consistent with existing requirements for entry into the United States.
- CBP developed TVS to be scalable and seamlessly applicable to all modes of transport throughout the travel continuum. CBP has successfully implemented facial biometrics into the entry/arrivals processes at all international airports and into the exit processes at 32 airport locations. CBP also established facial biometrics at 26 seaports and all pedestrian lanes at both the Southwest Border and the Northern Border land POEs.
- Additionally, CBP’s biometric facial comparison technology is integrated in all CBP’s legacy Global Entry kiosks, reducing kiosk processing time by 85 percent,6 and CBP plans to deploy new Global Entry Touchless Portals at other locations around the country. These new Portals also utilize secure biometric facial comparison technology, are completely touch-free, and decrease processing time required by the biometric facial comparison technology by 94 percent to approximately 3.5 seconds per traveler.7
- CBP is also working on a technology solution to deploy facial biometrics to our land border vehicle lanes where we believe we will see our most significant enhancement to streamlining the arrival process. Testing will allow CBP to find the best technology solution to ensure high match rates in a more challenging environment.
- In total, more than 193 million travelers have been processed using biometric facial comparison technology, allowing CBP to biometrically confirm more than 1,500 individuals posing under a false or assumed identity.
- CBP is committed to traveler privacy, which is at the core of our biometric entry-exit efforts. CBP uses biometric facial comparison technology only at specific times and locations where travelers are already legally required to present proof of identity. CBP and its approved travel partners notify travelers through message boards and electronic signs, as well as audio announcements in some cases, that CBP or a travel partner, such as airline, airport, or cruise personnel, will be taking photos for identity verification purposes. The signage and announcements also notify eligible travelers of their “opt out” rights. U.S. citizens and select foreign nationals8 who are not required to provide biometrics and who wish to opt out of the new facial biometric process may simply notify a CBP officer, request a manual document check, and proceed with processing consistent with existing requirements for entry into the United States.9 CBP continually works with airlines, cruise line operators, airports, and other port facilities to incorporate appropriate notices and processes into their current business models and provides easy access to tear sheets on the CBP website.
- CBP has an ongoing public awareness campaign to increase traveler knowledge of the facial comparison program occurring when travelers arrive internationally at airports; these program awareness signs are posted at more than 20 airports and have appeared in national publications. CBP also provides briefings to personnel who are assigned to the Traveler Communications Center (TCC) and CBP Information Center to ensure they have the latest information to answer questions. As part of its outreach efforts, CBP launched an updated biometrics website10 on September 1, 2020, that explains and promotes facial comparison technology and biometrics information in a dynamic and interactive manner. The site also highlights CBP’s commitment to privacy protections, outlined in the DHS Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs),11 by publishing the current locations using biometric facial comparison technology, information on how to request alternative screening, copies of CBP’s privacy signage, and a link to TVS privacy documents.
- CBP provides details of its facial biometric entry-exit efforts through applicable Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) and Privacy Act Systems of Records Notices (SORN).12 CBP published its comprehensive PIA concerning TVS in November 2018, and a subsequent update in February 2021. The PIA explains aspects of CBP’s biometric use, as well as policies and procedures for the collection, storage, analysis, use, dissemination, retention, and/or deletion of data.13 The PIA and the public notices specifically highlight that all facial images of U.S. citizens used for facial biometric matching purposes are held in secure CBP systems for no more than 12 hours after identity verification, in case of an extended system outage or for disaster recovery.14 CBP strictly adheres to these requirements and a recent assessment by the DHS Office of the Inspector General found that CBP complied with biometric facial recognition policies to identify international travelers at airports.15 DHS also utilizes a PIA for its biometric testing, research, and evaluation activities performed by the DHS Science and Technology Directorate for DHS Components, including CBP, documenting the use, protections, and retention or deletion of test data.16
- These policies and safeguards also apply to CBP’s approved partners, such as airlines, airport authorities, or cruise lines, prohibiting them from retaining the photos they collect as part of the entry/exit program for their own business purposes. They cannot store images following transmittal to CBP, and the partner must allow CBP to perform security audits and penetration tests to evaluate cybersecurity and privacy postures to ensure compliance with this requirement. As stated in the TVS PIA, CBP developed business requirements and system-wide standards to document this commitment and private sector partners must agree as a condition of participation. To date, CBP has conducted eight assessments with one being completed, four currently addressing recommendations, and three having reports on findings being drafted. Four additional assessments are planned for the coming fiscal year. The CBP Privacy Division has also nearly completed a Privacy Evaluation, as noted in the 2021 TVS PIA update, to ensure that all parties, including airlines, airport authorities, and cloud providers, are in compliance with the required privacy protections. The evaluation is currently pending internal final review.
- CBP continues to integrate biometric facial comparison technology into its travel operations as part of its vision for a comprehensive biometric entry-exit system that avoids adding new processes; utilizes existing infrastructure; leverages existing stakeholder systems, processes, and business models; compliments passenger behaviors and expectations; and utilizes existing traveler data and existing Government information technology infrastructure.
- CBP is leading efforts, consistent with U.S. law, to transform how travelers interact with not only CBP, but also airports, airlines, cruise lines, and other government agencies with security functions such as the Transportation Security Administration, creating a seamless travel process that is both reliable and secure.
- Moving forward, CBP will continue to work closely with key stakeholders including NIST, Congress, industry, and our travel partners to ensure we share best practices and lessons learned, as we continue to seek the most innovative technologies, streamline our business processes, and strengthen our border security operations.

- This article was published more than 2 years ago
- Civil rights groups are pushing the Biden administration to take a stand against facial recognition technology, arguing the rapidly spreading software poses “profound and unprecedented threats” to Americans’ freedom and way of life.
- The American Civil Liberties Union and more than 40 other groups urged President Biden in a letter Tuesday to freeze federal use of facial recognition and block federal funds from being used by state and local governments to buy or access the artificial-intelligence tools.
- The groups say a Democratic-controlled government will be more receptive to their arguments of the software’s bias and privacy threats than the previous administration.
- But the advocates are certain to face resistance from law enforcement and other facial recognition proponents who argue that a technology widely used to unlock phones and confirm travelers’ identities should also be made available to scan for wanted fugitives and investigate crimes.
- The White House did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
- The groups argue that the continued expansion of facial recognition runs counter to Biden’s inauguration-speech declaration that the government should work to advance “equity, civil rights [and] racial justice.” The technology has been shown in research to return inaccurate matches more often when assessing people of color, and it has been faulted in three separate wrongful arrests of Black men who were falsely identified by a police facial recognition search.
- Facial recognition used to identify Lafayette Square protester accused of assault
- The technology’s developers and defenders argue that it is largely accurate and will improve over time. They caution that it should be used only as an investigative aid for officers looking for leads on whom to pursue, not as a primary piece of evidence.
- But the letter’s signers argue that the software poses a clear threat to civil rights, regardless of its accuracy, because it could be used by government authorities to silently track innocent people or surveil protests.
- “Even if the technology worked perfectly, it would facilitate the mass tracking of each person’s movements in public space — something intolerable in a free and open society,” the letter states. “We cannot allow its normalization.”
- Opinion: I was wrongfully arrested because of facial recognition. Why are police allowed to use it?
- The face-scanning software can be used to identify people from afar without their knowledge or consent, and it works by quickly comparing a search photo against a vast database of driver’s licenses, mug shots and other images.
- The software is widely used now to unlock phones, identify people in online photos and grant access at schools, stadiums and public housing complexes. Twenty of the country’s biggest airports also use facial recognition to scan travelers’ faces.
- But federal investigators and police departments have also used the software for years to help identify potential suspects, victims and witnesses caught on surveillance cameras or seen on social media. Neither Congress nor state legislatures has authorized the development of such systems, and no clear federal oversight or regulations govern their use.
- The technology has been banned or restricted by more than a dozen cities and states across the United States since 2019, including San Francisco, Boston, Portland, Ore., and Minneapolis. In December, New York became the first state to ban the technology’s use in schools until at least 2022, citing “serious and legitimate privacy concerns.”
- But some cities have stuck by the systems. In Detroit, where the police chief said the system was useful even though it almost never returned a perfect match without human guidance, city leaders last year approved further use of the software, saying it helped protect the public while empowering the police. (Nearly all of the more than 100 people whose faces were run through a facial recognition search last year were Black, police data shows.)
- FBI, ICE find state driver’s license photos are a gold mine for facial-recognition searches
- The backers of the letter Tuesday urged Biden to sign an executive order halting federal facial recognition use “so long as bias pervades these systems and as long as Congress has not acted to authorize” its use.
- They also pushed the White House to block state and local governments from using federal funds to buy or access the systems and to lend its support to a bill introduced last year by Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) that would place a moratorium on federal deployment of facial recognition and other “biometric surveillance systems.”
- As summer camps turn on facial recognition, parents demand: More smiles, please
- The signers include Amnesty International, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Freedom House and a number of other left-leaning activists, human-rights organizations and tech advocacy groups. But facial recognition has faced bipartisan criticism in Washington, including from congressional Republicans such as Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), who has said it poses dystopian threats of government overreach.
- Rohit Chopra, the former Federal Trade Commission head and Biden’s choice to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said last month that he agreed with calls to severely restrict the technology because it “is fundamentally flawed and reinforces harmful biases.”
- Local, state and federal law enforcement officials have revealed few details about how widely they use such software or how accurate the matches have been. A 2019 government audit found that the FBI’s facial recognition system, which analyzed more than 641 million photos from passports and other government databases, had been searched more than 390,000 times between 2011 and 2019.
- Oregon became a testing ground for Amazon’s facial-recognition policing. But what if Rekognition gets it wrong?
- The technology is also being increasingly deployed at U.S. travel hubs, with more than 23 million travelers scanned at 30 airports, seaports and land crossings last year, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, who called it “the way of the future” in a report last week.
- Fewer than 300 “impostors” have been caught by the systems since 2018, the agency said. Critics argue the trade-off is not worth it, given that the mass data gathering can also backfire: Government auditors said last year that 184,000 images of travelers captured as part of a CBP facial recognition program were stolen by hackers during a 2019 breach of a CBP subcontractor, with some of them later posted to the dark Web.
- CBP has promoted facial recognition as a quick and contactless way to confirm identification during the pandemic. And the Jan. 6 insurrection led a wave of federal investigators and amateur sleuths to use the software in hopes of identifying rioters who stormed the Capitol.
- But Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel with the ACLU, said she worries such uses may gloss over how the technology could further supercharge more surveillance in a “completely over-surveilled society,” where many already feel they are under close government watch.
- “The power of anything that is this dangerous, that is this biased, to track us across space and time for unknown periods,” she said, poses a threat to Americans’ liberty “to go to a protest, to go to a church, to go to your doctor without the government surveilling you.”

- Customs and Border Protection  used facial recognition tools to scan over 23 million travelers’ faces at 30-plus points of entry in 2020, and failed to turn up a single example of an individual impersonating someone else at an airport, per a Wednesday report by OneZero.
- The agency disclosed the statistics in its annual report for fiscal year 2020 (October 2019 to September 2020) released this month. The points of entry included airports, seaports, and pedestrian crossings. CBP facial recognition failed to flag a single imposter attempting to enter the country via an airport, and  managed to detect less than 100 imposters at pedestrian crossings. This would seem to suggest that either there are very few imposters using fake credentials to enter the U.S. or that the CBP system is very ineffective at finding them.
- As OneZero noted, Congress first mandated that the U.S. attorney general implement a tracking system for foreign citizens entering and exiting the U.S. in 1996, and the PATRIOT Act of 2001 expanded the requirement to include biometric signifiers like fingerprints, iris scans, or facial recognition. CBP kicked off its initiative to employ face recognition scanners as part of this program in 2013.
- Since 2018, according to public CBP documents, the agency has identified just seven air travelers as imposters via face recognition, and only 285 at land crossings. In its report, CBP noted that it had managed to increase the number of faces it scans despite overall passenger volumes for all modes of transportation dropping 42%  (54.2% for airports alone) during the coronavirus pandemic. CBP sounded an upbeat note about the technology:
- Despite the overall decrease in travel, biometric processing increased dramatically. CBP biometrically processed more than 23 million travelers using biometric facial comparison technology at entry, exit, and Preclearance locations with a match rate of more than 97 percent in fiscal year 2020. CBP sees biometric technology as the way of the future, a means of achieving faster processing times for travelers, and continuing the facilitation improvements that the agency has attained through other technologies and CBP’s Trusted Traveler programs.
- CBP is part of the Department of Homeland Security. DHS was budgeted $62 billion in fiscal year 2020 (actually spending $92 billion due to coronavirus-related disaster funds disbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency). CBP spent about $16.67 billion over the same time period. The Biometric Entry-Exit Program is funded through the collection of fees on certain kinds of visas, with Congress having allocated about $1 billion in spending for it over the 10-year period beginning in 2016. Coupled with other bloated CBP funding, this amounts to a massive expenditure of resources that could be directed elsewhere in the middle of a pandemic.
- Facial recognition has become increasingly common at the nation’s airports, where it’s touted as improving the effectiveness and efficiency of security screenings. However, the technology has been repeatedly shown to exhibit various kinds of racial and gender bias even when it does work, which it often doesn’t. It’s often unclear what kinds of privacy protections exist for travelers, and what protections there are vary between airports and airlines.
- The DHS inspector general released a report in September 2020 warning that DHS’s database of biometrics on more than 250 million individuals may not be secure; the report also singled out CBP for failing to protect 184,000 face scans from a data breach in 2018). CBP responded by blaming a subcontractor that “disregarded the terms of their contract and normal ethical business principles.” A report by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology released in 2017 argued that DHS does not have the legal authority to collect such scans from U.S. citizens in the first place, and that its implementation of face recognition is riddled with technical errors, is evaluated using bogus metrics, and raises serious concerns about privacy.
- In a separate report released in September 2020, the Government Accountability Office identified numerous issues with the CBP face recognition program, including that signs notifying travelers that their faces could be scanned and that CBP actively discourages passengers from being able to opt out. The GAO also found that CBP doesn’t stay on top of how accurate its face scans are; CBP only vets scans from two flights per airport per week and it takes up to weeks to detect problems.

- Your guide to a better future
- That's up by 4 million from 2019.
- Facial recognition tech is scanning more faces at borders and airports.
- US Customs and Border Protection used 
  facial recognition
 technology on more than 23 million travelers in 2020, according to a report published by the agency. That's up from the 19 million travelers CBP scanned with the tech in 2019.
- The biometric facial scans had a match rate of more than 97% last year, CBP said. The agency also noted that since 2018, officers have identified seven imposters at US airports and 285 imposters in land pedestrian settings.
- Critics of facial recognition technology have expressed several concerns with using it at airports. This includes the tradeoff between giving up your identity and privacy to zip through 
  security
, and the fact that research has shown facial recognition algorithms have error rates that vary depending on a person's race or gender, meaning some groups could face extra screening more often than others.
- In 2019, CBP dropped plans to require that US citizens go through a biometric face scan when entering or leaving the country, maintaining the right for people to opt out. The agency was also scrutinized for setting up facial recognition systems without proper vetting or regulatory safeguards, according to reports.
- CBP identified its first imposter using facial recognition tech in 2018: a man who tried to pose as a French citizen at Washington Dulles International Airport.
- CBP asserts that facial recognition "can have a direct, positive impact on the 
  travel
 industry's ability to resume operations following the pandemic," noting that, "using biometric technology, air and sea partners can replace current check in, security, and boarding processes that involve long lines, heavy personal interaction, and the handling of travel documents. Facial biometric technology encourages contactless travel that involves minimal physical contact and promotes social distancing."

- The use of facial recognition technology is often controversial in terms of privacy and bias issues, and some even suggest it should be banned. But ethical considerations aside, is it really that effective?
- Apparently not.
- U.S. Customs and Border Protection is one user of facial recognition technology. In 2020, a year that did see a drop in travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic, out of 23 million facial scans undertaken by CBP the net result of the technology attempting to identify imposters — those attempting to enter the U.S. using a false identity at airports — was zero.
- The results were disclosed by the agency in its annual report on trade and travel published earlier this month. The points of entry where CBP used the technology included airports, seaports and pedestrian crossings.
- Although the facial recognition technology did manage to detect fewer than 100 imposters at pedestrian crossings, as Gizmodo noted the overall results indicate either one of two things: Very few imposters use fake credentials to enter the U.S., or the CBP system is very ineffective at finding them.
- OneZero reported that the Government Accountability Office “lambasted” CBP over lackluster accuracy audits, poor signage notifying the public that the technology is being used, and little information on how the system worked in late 2020. The GAO also noted that CBP didn’t audit the technology’s efficacy until March 2020 and have put further audits on hold because of COVID-19.
- The lack of detection could be argued as a sign that the facial recognition technology is not working as well as it should, but others argue that other factors could be involved.
- “We should not assume that the CBP facial recognition tools have failed simply by a lack of imposter identification, as this may simply be the result of fewer individuals attempting to enter the country as a result of COVID,” Stuart Sharp, vice president of technical services at identity and access management service provider OneLogin Inc., told SiliconANGLE. “Nevertheless, while biometrics have a role to play in identification, it does face significant limitations.”
- When comparing a facial or fingerprint scan to the stored value, the system accepts a degree of variation, Sharp explained. “This is called the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) metric, which is the probability that the system will incorrectly identify a user as valid,” he said. “Realizing that facial recognition is simply verifying that the scan is ‘similar’ to the stored image, you can see that there is a real risk that the CBP tools are not detecting skillful imposters.“
- Josh Bohls, founder of secure content capture company Inkscreen LLC, said the system may not have identified anyone using false credentials. But I suspect the agency considers it a huge success in that it was able to collect a massive trove of images of visitors that can be directly linked to their passports,” he said. “This is the holy grail of artificial intelligence and machine learning system training data and will serve to improve the system dramatically over time.”

- According to an annual report released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), more than 23 million people were “processed” using facial recognition technology at entry, exit and preclearance locations (e.g., airports, seaports, pedestrian crossings, etc.) in 2020 — up 21% from 2019. Despite the increase, however, the system caught no imposters traveling through airports and fewer than 100 pedestrian imposters, OneZero’s Dave Gershgorn reported.
- At face value, this seems like a good thing: people are not trying to illicitly sneak through airports posing as other people, and now we’ve got the technology to A) prove it and B) dissuade future perpetrators. But in actuality, studies have shown that facial recognition is not as effective when considering a handful of demographics in particular — namely women and people with darker skin tones — which begs a fundamental question about its use: How can authorities justify implementing a potentially biased technology if it’s not even helping them identify any criminals?
- In 2019, The New York Times reported that, according to a study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, facial recognition systems falsely identified African-American and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more frequently than Caucasian faces. It also failed to identify women more often than men, and older adults more frequently than younger adults.
- “The program’s implementation has been met with skepticism from the Government Accountability Office (GAO),” Gershgorn wrote. “In late 2020, the oversight organization lambasted CBP over lackluster accuracy audits, poor signage notifying the public the technology is being used, and little information offered to the public on how its systems worked.”
- On the contrary, CBP has maintained the system has shown “virtually no measurable differential performance in results based on demographic factors,” but has thus far failed to provide any sufficient evidence to substantiate those claims, according to Gershgorn, who also pointed out that CBP suffered a data breach in 2019, when a rogue contractor downloaded nearly 200,000 facial-recognition images and leaked some of them into the public domain.
- Over the course of the past two years, facial recognition has helped to capture just seven imposters traveling through U.S. airports and 285 by way of land crossings, but it’s difficult not to question its application and subsequent effectiveness. CBP is adamant that it will be a critical component of restoring the travel industry to its pre-pandemic glory, though it is not immediately clear how or why that would be true.

- (Mis)Uses of Technology
- The CBP and DHS have released their annual report [PDF] covering trade and travel. It touts the agencies’ successes in these areas but raises some questions about the use of facial recognition tech to make the nation safer.
- Dave Gershgorn, writing for One Zero, points out the system the DHS and CBP claim is essential to national security isn’t doing much to secure the nation. And it’s not for a lack of input data.
- U.S. Customs and Border Protection scanned more than 23 million people with facial recognition technology at airports, seaports, and pedestrian crossings in 2020, the agency recently revealed in its annual report on trade and travel.
- The agency scanned four million more people than in 2019. The report indicates that the system caught no imposters traveling through airports last year and fewer than 100 new pedestrian imposters.
- There are two ways of looking at this — neither of which justify the DHS’s aggressive expansion of biometric collection at airports, border crossings, and any other place travelers might be found.
- This low number of imposters recognized could indicate the system is flawed — incapable of accurately doing the job it’s supposed to do: recognize faces. This is a problem inherent to every facial recognition algorithm being used anywhere. The tech tends to be most accurate when presented with white male faces. Everyone else is subjected to higher risk of being misidentified, which can lead to false arrests or being prevented from traveling.
- But it could also indicate imposters aren’t all that common — certainly not common enough to justify the erection of a mass surveillance system that gives travelers the option of giving up their biometric info or not traveling.
- The CBP only began tracking and publishing stats in 2018, trailing its biometric rollout by a couple of years. Since 2018, the government has caught less than 300 imposters. Over that same time period, it performed 50 million face scans. That’s a pretty terrible return on investment. But that’s not how the CBP portrays this in its report:
- Biometrics have proven an effective tool to combat the use of stolen and fraudulent travel and identity documents. Since the program’s inception, in 2018, CBP officers at U.S. airports have successfully intercepted seven impostors who were denied admission to the United States and identified 285 imposters on arrival in the land pedestrian environment.
- I guess it all depends on what your definition of “effective” is. The CBP’s expansive definition suggests literally any number above zero justifies the cost of the tech and its attendant surveillance creep.
- Of course, if the real purpose of the program is to create a massive database of facial photos and personal information, it’s been a tremendous success. And if that’s all the CBP and DHS expect from it, it will continue to perform this task with minimal interruption.
- But travelers and taxpayers should expect more from the DHS and its agencies. Spending millions to deal with a minor problem by deploying tech that remains unproven shouldn’t be considered acceptable. Neither is the alternative: a system that rarely recognizes imposters, allowing government agencies to assume it’s less of a problem than it might actually be.

- This low number of imposters recognized could indicate the system is flawed — incapable of accurately doing the job it’s supposed to do: recognize faces…
- But it could also indicate imposters aren’t all that common…
- These are both possible and are the most likely option by far. However, it is also technically possible that imposters have stopped coming because of the technology.
- Highly unlike, but a third possibility.
- Who are these imposters!? I want to talk to them, face to face to face.
- Of course, if the real purpose of the program is to create a massive database of facial photos and personal information, it’s been a tremendous success.
- Stated objectives are often wildly different from true objectives. In many cases, particularly when government is involved, they can be diametrically opposed. Just as we should always look at what politicians do rather than what they say, we should also always look closely at what any given program actually accomplishes, versus what we are told the program is supposed to accomplish.
- Was there a reason in them being Imposters?
Why they would try to come into the USA?
Any comments on that??
- … this article leaves at least one important question not quite addressed:
- CPB claims to have identified 300 imposters;
Was the use of computerized facial recognition technology actually the means by which these imposters were identified and caught?
- …something tells me this massive facial recognition array is accessible to China, Russia, private black hats and anyone else who wants to find out who cut them off on the freeway.
- I wonder if CBP’s own employees are in that database.
- I’d like to see the breakdown of how much of the stated successes were only possible to catch via facial recognition alone? How many of them would have been detected at a point where documentation was checked, fingerprints scanned, etc.
- I suspect the actual success numbers are probably even lower than what has been stated when the rest of the detection mechanisms are taken into account.
- So, you have the idea that they Dont have a list/computer display that can show every persons Passport with a picture of the persons? form both lands, canada and the USA? or any other combination??
- Our gov. is so far behind in tech, its laughable.
- How does this facial recognition work when everyone is wearing a mask?
- Less well.
- Facial recognition software can still analyze partial faces, such as the eyes. Mask and opaque glasses will hide your face even better, and there are shirts and accessories with patterns that confuse face-finding routines.
- Also facial recognition image capture depends sometimes on non-visible light (infrared?) and some hackers have used this as a means to project another face on their own, which fools some facial recognition software.
- If CBP has been on the cams all this time and still doesn’t know who the imposter is, then CBP is hella sus….
- when will the CBP stop lying to us with BS about impostors and tell the truth as to what the real reason for this civil rights violating software is for! it is not just the CBP that wants the CBP to have this tech, it is the rest of the alphabet mafia insisting they have have it. that way when any of the 3 letter mafia’s gets band from using it there will be others to fill the gap!

- The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) used facial recognition scanners in order to monitor the arrivals and departures of more than 23 million travellers at over 30 different entry points in 2020. However, these systems failed to detect a single example of an imposter. The US CBP agency revealed these statistics in their annual report for 2020.
- The facial recognition scanners are placed at a number of entry points including seaports, pedestrian crossings, and airports. The CBP’s facial scanners were unable to identify a single imposter attempting to enter a US airport. The scanners also were only able to detect under 100 imposters at pedestrian crossings.
