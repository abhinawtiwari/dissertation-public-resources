- Back office automation start-up ScaleFactor has collapsed claiming the COVID-19 pandemic had wiped out its business.
- But the problems appear to be more related to losing the confidence of its investors and customers, who said its products failed to work properly and the company consistently over-promised and under-delivered.
- Established in 2014 in Austin, Texas, ScaleFactor built accounting AI-based automation and book-keeping software for small businesses that integrated with Quickbooks and Xero in such a way that it would 'revolutionise accounting'.
- In fact, as Forbes discovered, it often relied on traditional bookkeepers and hired a Filipino contract accounting firm. Customers received monthly statements rather than the real-time data they were promised.
- The company had raised USD 100 million shortly before its demise.

- Accounting is the bane of small business, a tedious task made worse by its costly expense. Kurt Rathmann’s startup had a magic fix: artificial intelligence-powered tools that could replace the accountant, and do so much more. For a fraction of the cost, ScaleFactor promised to take care of bookkeeping, bills and taxes. If customers had doubts, they were reassured by the $100 million invested by big-name venture capital firms. “Because evenings are for families, not finance,” ScaleFactor’s website proclaimed.
- But some of the startup founders and cafe owners who did take the night off soon regretted their decision to hire ScaleFactor: they didn’t get what they paid for. Instead of software producing financial statements, dozens of accountants did most of it manually from ScaleFactor’s Austin headquarters or from an outsourcing office in the Philippines, according to former employees. Some customers say they received books filled with errors, and were forced to re-hire accountants, or clean up the mess themselves.
- None of this was known publicly last month, when Rathmann announced that ScaleFactor was closing. In an interview with Forbes on June 23, the CEO blamed the Covid-19 pandemic for almost halving ScaleFactor’s $7 million in annual recurring revenue as demand from small businesses crumbled. About 100 people would be laid off with three months of severance, and cash would be returned to investors — a seemingly tidy end to another startup afflicted by the pandemic.
- Customers were the first to cry foul. “If you're one of the investors that gave these clowns $100 million...You should know they've flushed it down the toilet with poor product and poor service,” Lindsey Reinders, a ScaleFactor customer, wrote online after seeing the news. “COVID-19 is just a convenient scapegoat.”
- Lindsey Reinders' business lost $17,000 from a ScaleFactor error. She was offered a partial refund on the condition she not discuss her experience.
- Though the pandemic may have been a death knell, ScaleFactor was on rocky ground long before, Forbes found. Technology startups are often rewarded for a “fake it ‘til you make it” mentality by venture capital firms willing to throw money at a product until it meets expectations. But ScaleFactor used aggressive sales tactics and prioritized chasing capital instead of building software that ultimately fell far short of what it promised, according to interviews with 15 former employees and executives. When customers fled, executives tried to obscure the real damage.
- Along the way, big name VC shops including San Francisco-based Bessemer Venture Partners, Canaan Partners of Menlo Park and New York’s Coatue Management continued to pour more money into the business, compelling ScaleFactor to keep growing with a software product that proclaimed to replace accountants, but was relying on them all along.
- “That’s what I found out ScaleFactor is: pretty much a glorified bookkeeping firm,” says one accountant, who, like other former ScaleFactor employees that spoke to Forbes, asked to remain anonymous because they signed non-disclosure agreements and feared retaliation from the company.
- The typical process of accounting involves thorough consultations to understand the nuances of a company’s books; for instance, whether to consider an Amazon purchase as an expense or bill payment. Errors in this process can lead to bills being paid twice or not being paid at all, snowballing into disaster.
- ScaleFactor promised to digitize this process with a dashboard centered on five main automated tools: bookkeeping, financial forecasting, bill pay, tax completion and payroll. Customers just had to hand over paperwork, receipts and login information for their sales software.
- For its core bookkeeping tool, ScaleFactor told customers that after an initial consultation, the artificial intelligence-powered product would do the work: pull numbers from other software, like Quickbooks or Xero, and then figure out how transactions should be listed or organized. Rather than monthly statements, ScaleFactor’s software would show real-time updates on its portal, according to sales materials seen by Forbes.
- “If you're one of the investors that gave these clowns $100 million...You should know they've flushed it down the toilet with poor product and poor service.”
- But in reality, the tool was glitchy and couldn't be relied on to accurately sort transactions, so ScaleFactor employed a team of bookkeepers and accountants who instead would manually complete a customer’s books or correct errors from the software, according to employees who worked on its product, accounting and customer sales teams. To bolster this effort, ScaleFactor hired The Outsourced Accountant, an offshore firm in the Philippines, to help. But no matter where they worked, the unpredictable technology continued to lead to errors in customers’ books.
- After cancelling her contract in April, Reinders, who complained online, says that she learned a ScaleFactor employee had incorrectly credited $17,000 to a customer of her e-commerce business. But by the time the error was realized more than 6 months after the fact, she was unable to recoup the money because a collectable term period had expired. "We had really good, clear, clean books when we hired them," she says. (ScaleFactor offered her a partial refund on her annual $23,000 contract, Reinders says, if she signed a non-disclosure agreement barring her from talking about her experience; she didn’t.)
- Now that the company is closing, other ScaleFactor customers are reckoning with the risks of doing business with a startup that might over-promise and under-deliver. San Francisco-based coffee shop owners Cornelia and Robert Stang, are hiring a new accountant to scrub months of erroneous bookkeeping. “How hard can this be? We are a coffee shop,” Cornelia recalled telling ScaleFactor when she abandoned her contract this year. “If you can’t fix our problem you can’t fix anybody’s.”
- ScaleFactor declined to make Rathmann available for an interview for this article and would only respond to emailed questions, before replying: “The email below is filled with numerous factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations,” said Rathman in an emailed statement sent by a spokesperson. “I have no further comment.”
- “That’s what I found out ScaleFactor is: pretty much a glorified bookkeeping firm,” says one accountant.
- Investors Bessemer and Coatue, two of the firms that led funding rounds into the company, also declined to comment while the third, Canaan, didn’t respond. (Bessemer partners with Forbes on its Cloud 100 list.)
- Rathmann, 33, was born an entrepreneur. While his friends saved pennies for video games, he mowed lawns to save for his first business. At 17, he owned a company that installed lighting in Houston homes. By the time he launched ScaleFactor in 2014, he had worked as an auditor at KPMG, and as a CFO at a small telecommunications company. In these roles, Rathmann saw firsthand a glaring need for technology to help small businesses with their bookkeeping services.
- Michael Gilroy led a $10 million funding round at Canaan Partners for ScaleFactor. He is now a partner at Coatue Management, another ScaleFactor investor.
- ScaleFactor got its big break in 2017 at Techstars Austin, a startup accelerator, that was a co-investor in an early $2.5 million funding round. It then caught the attention of Michael Gilroy, an associate at Canaan Partners (now at Coatue). “Great products built by teams that understand their customer will win,” Gilroy wrote in July 2018, when his firm led a $10 million investment in the company. “We’re just getting started at ScaleFactor.”
- Momentum built fast, and six months later ScaleFactor landed $30 million in a financing round led by Bessemer partner Byron Deeter, a prominent Silicon Valley cloud-computing investor who had made prescient bets on Box, DocuSign and Twilio. (He was also a founding partner of the Forbes Cloud 100.)
- Despite the votes of confidence from well-known investors, customers were finding that ScaleFactor was falling short. Patrick Coddou, whose e-commerce business paid ScaleFactor more than $10,000, requested to cancel in April 2019 after his statements, expected to be delivered on a real-time basis, were delivered monthly because they were being processed manually. “They just didn’t deliver on the promise,” he says.
- Potential investors were coming to similar conclusions. Ahead of yet another funding round, multiple venture capital firms passed on investing, according to people familiar with their decisions, having determined that ScaleFactor was more of a services business than a software platform.
- During due diligence, one of these potential investors learned that ScaleFactor had a customer service team who they were told functioned as “account managers.” Further inquiry revealed the employees were accountants. “So the software might look automated, but they actually had all these people on the backend,” the potential investor said.
- The fact was further obscured by ScaleFactor’s creative accounting: rather than budgeting the customer service team under “cost of goods sold,” ScaleFactor listed related costs under a separate category, clouding the true amount spent on servicing the product, according to two people familiar with the business.
- Byron Deeter, a prominent cloud-computing investor and partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, led ScaleFactor's $30 million funding round.
- In the end, the only tool with a true automation component, the potential investor found and employees confirmed, was an internal workflow engine, or “a guided to-do list” for ScaleFactor employees that organized tasks required to close a customer’s books.
- Even as doubts about its product emerged, ScaleFactor scored a term sheet for a $60 million funding round at the start of June 2019. Coatue Management, a large technology investor overseeing $16 billion in assets, led the new funding round, joined by Bessemer, Canaan and others.
- At a meeting to announce the impending funding to employees, ScaleFactor’s then-chief revenue officer David Loia told the sales team that if it could sell $800,000 in new bookings for the month of June, ScaleFactor would double the team’s bonuses, several employees say. (Loia declined to comment.) “This is the chance of a lifetime,” one person who attended the meeting recalled Loia saying. “No deal is off the table.”
- Even though ScaleFactor was under confidentiality provisions barring it from discussing the funding round outside the company, Robert Stang, the coffee shop owner, says he was offered a discount because ScaleFactor was chasing a sales target ahead of an impending series C funding round. “This gave them a push for sales,” Stang recalled the ScaleFactor employee saying. He signed the $6,000 contract on June 18 to lock in the discount, even though his first bill wasn’t due until October, according to a copy of the contract seen by Forbes.
- Some customers were offered discounts in exchange for a reference; others were signed on without billing information, former sales employees say. At the end of the month, the sales team was told the target had been met. The company celebrated by throwing them a party at an arts and crafts factory in East Austin, where employees took photos with oversized bonus checks.
- “We really thought we could automate the entire back office of a small business,” said Kurt Rathmann.
- But a few weeks later, the sales team learned they would not receive bonuses after all: some of the deals had been illegitimate, and the target had in fact not been met. ScaleFactor got the funding anyway, in a round that valued the company at $360 million.
- As ScaleFactor scrambled to add new customers, existing customers were demanding refunds. The outflow only increased after the funding round closed.
- David Rathmann, the CEO’s brother hired in April 2019, held weekly meetings called “Churn Desk” where cancellation requests were prioritized rather than immediately processed; if a customer threatened to complain on social media, they would be let go quicker, for example. This had the effect of delaying the true churn figures from appearing in ScaleFactor’s Salesforce data, which was used in board presentations. The true backlog of pending cancellations and cancellation requests were recorded in a private Google spreadsheet, four people who attended the meetings say. (ScaleFactor would not make Rathmann available for comment.)
- Executives, including Kurt Rathmann, were stunned during a different weekly meeting in October 2019 when an employee responsible for tracking churn showed that close to $600,000 in annual recurring revenue was at risk of being lost — in part due to customers indicating or requesting cancellation — according to multiple people with knowledge of the matter. An informal limit on the value of contracts allowed to be cancelled during Churn Desk meetings was then imposed in an attempt to slow the outflow.
- In January 2020 Kurt Rathmann called an all-hands meeting to announce that ScaleFactor would pivot to a marketplace model that connected traditional accountants with their clients. About 40 employees, mostly accountants and bookkeepers, were laid off when it was announced in February as ScaleFactor “2.020.”
- Covid-19 swept the United States the following month, and existing customers weren’t buying in; Robert and Cornelia Stang balked after being told their contract would jump from $500-a-month to $1,700. In the spring, investors discussed ScaleFactor’s future before deciding to shutter operations, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions.
- At the end of the day, Kurt Rathmann explained to Forbes last month, customers were craving a person, rather than a computer to do their accounting. “We really thought we could automate the entire back office of a small business,” Rathmann said. A lofty goal that more money couldn’t achieve.

- CEO Kurt Rathmann says ScaleFactor lost 50% of its revenue as a result of Covid-19.
- By the end of last year, software startup ScaleFactor had emerged as a buzzy financial services company, raising $100 million in 12 months from big-name investors including Bessemer Venture Partners and Coatue Management.
- But in March, that upward trajectory was cut short as the Covid-19 pandemic arrived in the United States, wiping out demand for its software from its core customers of small and medium sized businesses. Now, the company is shutting down, its CEO and founder Kurt Rathmann tells Forbes. “It’s not the outcome we wanted,” Rathmann says. “But it’s the fiscally responsible CEO thing to do.”
- ScaleFactor’s 100 employees were told during a town hall Tuesday that half of them would be laid off immediately, and that by the end of August there will be about 10 employees to help wind down the company. Departing employees will receive 12 weeks severance and healthcare until the end of 2020.
- The announcement stands in contrast to the company’s position until recent days: just last week ScaleFactor had issued a post on LinkedIn that said it was hiring; one new employee, a senior user experience designer, posted last week on LinkedIn that he was “stoked” to be joining the company.
- The Austin, Texas-based company had most recently raised a $60 million series C led by Coatue in August 2019, which had given the company a $360 million post-money valuation. Other investors included Canaan Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners; those investors declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. The company said it would redistribute a portion of its capital back to investors, but declined to say how much.
- Rathmann says the pandemic wiped out almost half of ScaleFactor’s sales; the startup had reached $7 million in annual recurring revenue at the end of 2019. But the company appears to have been on rocky ground even before the pandemic. After raising capital last year, ScaleFactor hired dozens of customer service representatives to improve customer relations, only to lay off 40 of them in February as the company’s bottom line suffered. Rathmann acknowledges the decision may have affected his business once the pandemic hit, as customers demanded more human relationships, rather than automated services.
- Launched in 2014, ScaleFactor offered software that automates back-office tasks including bookkeeping and payroll. The idea was to provide the automated bookkeeping tools available to larger companies to small and medium sized businesses, a tool that complement other products from Shopify and Square that enable small businesses to operate online. It charged its more than 1,000 business customers a flat fee for its software, with packages starting at around $6,000 and reaching as high as about $30,000 a year — a revenue stream that has now dried up as small and medium-sized businesses have had to cut their own costs.
- ScaleFactor’s closure is yet another symptom of the pandemic’s varying effect on venture-backed startups. Some technology firms that enable remote workforces to thrive — such as workflow software startup Notion or cloud-based design company Figma — have seen their valuations soar far north of $1 billion.
- But those startups that rely on the success of industries like travel and real estate, which have been decimated by the pandemic as consumers have stayed home, have been forced to raise more funding, layoff workers, or close. In the real estate sector, venture backed office-space providers Convene and Knotel have laid off hundreds of workers. In travel, TripActions, a corporate travel management software startup that lost 95% of its business as a result of the pandemic, recently secured $125 million to keep the company afloat.
- ScaleFactor’s fate appears sealed by the fact it was unable to convince small and medium sized businesses looking to cut costs that its accounting software was one of necessity. “Business owners went into fight or flight mode,” Rathmann says. “You don’t necessarily need all the planning tools, high end gadgets. You just get back to the simple ‘pen and paper.’”

- Alexander Konovalov is the founder and CEO at vidby, a Swiss startup offering AI-powered video translation and dubbing across 70 languages.
- 
- The debate about whether artificial intelligence (AI) might displace human workers in the future has been going on for a long time. Technological progress may be perceived as a threat in the context of a one-sided forecast. According to McKinsey, "In about 60 percent of occupations, at least one-third of the constituent activities could be automated, implying substantial workplace transformations and changes for all workers."
- But another aspect of this trend should be kept in mind. By the end of 2025, the technological progress may create 12 million jobs more than will presumably be displaced. Influential personalities pour oil on the flame as well by affecting the perception of AI with their grandiose statements (e.g., Elon Musk argued that the perfection of AI will lead to massive unemployment).
- Who is not in danger of unemployment in light of the AI/robotics evolution? And why do we even talk about the unemployment conditions of a global staff shortage?
- People tend to be afraid of technology that has the potential to change the future of the labor market.
- Having served as the financial director of a corporation and being responsible for 19 factories from 2000 to 2003, I chose to implement automation in specific accounting processes. This caused disappointment among many accountants who were afraid of losing their positions. At that time, everyone was sure that the accounting profession would soon disappear since the whole job would be carried out by computers.
- Twenty years later, what do we see? The number of accountants is projected to increase. In the U.S., the employment growth rate from 2021 to 2031 is expected to be 6%. Today, it’s not about displacing a person from this profession, but it is way easier to automate it. Accountants have received a tool that helps make accounting more accurate and simpler. Fifty-six percent of industry professionals agree that technology increases their productivity.
- AI will undoubtedly cause a shift in how we work and it may even replace workers in some capacity—but it won't replace everyone.
- We’ve already been through this during the genesis of the Industrial Revolution. Despite the public being alarmed in the 1930s by the “new disease...namely technological unemployment” that John Maynard Keynes spoke of, technological progress did not lead to mass unemployment. This is confirmed by OECD research.
- AI differs from previous innovations in that it automates cognitive, not manual, tasks. Not only low-skilled workers but also “white-collar workers” can fall under the risk of job loss—but not all of them.
- According to OECD research, workers who successfully take advantage of AI gain better positions in the market. In other words, AI complements their intellectual activity—it doesn't replace it. AI, like most technologies, will not be able to completely displace humans from the labor market.
- Often, the leaders of the technology industry indulge in wishful thinking. Perhaps the world is already on the threshold of the arrival of a character such as Andrew from The Bicentennial Man in every home, and most business tasks will still be able to be solved with a single keystroke. But for now, the following remains true: Good old excel forever. One has to only recall the collapse of ScaleFactor, an infamous startup that fallaciously touted its AI was able to do the books for small businesses. Technologies can provide answers, but they cannot ask questions.
- Currently, AI does not have emotional intelligence. It is not intelligent enough to do creative work. Also, AI is not capable of showing empathy and cannot think outside the box. And this, in most cases, is the key to the development of innovations. Human creativity, insight, and contextual awareness are still key to making AI work.
- Why are we even talking about potential unemployment in the terms of the global staff shortage? Is AI worth being feared?
- Global unemployment will amount to 207 million, exceeding the figure for 2019 by about 21 million, by the end of 2022. We can indefinitely blame it on AI, robots and the pandemic. But it's important to consider the labor market as well. Companies feel a shortage of qualified staff. Korn Ferry research shows that by 2030, the global skill deficit will exceed 85 million people.
- While some fear that they might drown in the waters of AI, others are learning to “ride the wave” and become a professional who will not have to compete with technology. This is the future of the labor market, where AI combines with human judgment and decision-making, creating augmented intelligence.
- Such an approach will not only create new jobs but can revolutionize healthcare, improve road safety, solve complex problems for scientists, improve access to information, develop “understanding technologies” and more.
- Augmented intelligence can also create significant business opportunities. The global augmented intelligence market is expected to reach $121.5 billion by 2030.
- Conclusion
- So, who is currently not at risk of unemployment due to the development of AI? Those who know how to ask the right questions and analyze trends. There is no magic in AI. It is simply a set of tools that organizes, structures and analyzes data. We need to let technology do what it’s better at than us. But only by combining AI with our human intellect will we make all the processes more efficient and accurate while maintaining creativity and proactivity.
- Those who see technology as a tool, not a competitor, will find themselves in a win-win situation. Being aware of these facts will help to overcome both staff shortages and unemployment, partly associated with technological progress, in the future.

- September 14, 2020
- On June 23, 2020, Kurt Rathmann, CEO of ScaleFactor, an accounting automation software company, met with his team to break the news that they were letting go half of their team members that day. He then announced that the company was ceasing a majority of its operations on August 28, 2020*.
- Per the CEO’s message posted on the ScaleFactor website, he wrote, “It’s a day that we believed would never come, otherwise why would we dare to challenge the status quo?” He later continued, “We’ve known from the beginning that the finance and accounting problems we were setting out to solve were very big, very complex problems. There is a reason that no competitor in the space has solved them well - it’s difficult, it’s expensive, and solving them will take a long time.”
- Less than a month later, an article was published on Forbes claiming that ScaleFactor’s collapse was due to entirely different reasons than those laid out by Rathmann. Before diving into the nitty gritty of the Forbes article claims, let’s learn more about ScaleFactor—what they were setting out to accomplish and how they managed to raise significant funds in such a short amount of time.
- 
- ScaleFactor was established in 2014 in Austin, Texas and launched its first product three years later—an accounting automation and bookkeeping software that integrates with Quickbooks and Xero, designed for small businesses to classify transactions and update accounting books on a daily basis, such as updating general ledgers, generating reports, and creating mobile alerts and notifications. They also offer bill pay, payroll, and corporate card support. Most of these features were supposed to be powered by a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and accounting experts.
- ScaleFactor was kickstarted in 2017 when it received $2.5 million in funding from Techstars Austin, and then caught the attention of Canaan Partners, who invested another $10 million in 2018. Shortly after this, word spread about this software company that was going to disrupt the accounting world by using AI to solve very big, complex problems for the first time. Bessemer Venture Partners then invested another $30 million, and recently, ScaleFactor raised another $60 million in a Series C round led by Coatue, bringing the total capital raised to over $100 million.
- Coming back to the Forbes article, the author claimed that customers were not getting what they paid for, and were receiving books “filled with errors, and were forced to re-hire accountants, or clean up the mess themselves.” Instead of using AI to manage companies' books, ScaleFactor was in fact using dozens of accountants in their Austin headquarters as well as outsourcing some of the work to a Philippines-based company aptly named The Outsourced Accountant.
- The article reports that the AI tool couldn’t be relied on to accurately sort transactions and produce correct reports, and therefore a team of bookkeepers and accountants were hired to manually complete the tasks. G2’s AI analyst, Matthew Miller, thoroughly discusses AI’s role in analytics in this article, and even states “time and time again we see how companies are employing people to manually analyze and label data.”
- It was then reported that customers started to cancel, while some of them demanded refunds. According to former customers mentioned in the article, ScaleFactor was overpromising and underdelivering, creating erroneous bookkeeping, and being viewed as more of a bookkeeping service business than a software platform. To add insult to injury, according to Rathmann’s interview with Forbes in June 2020, ScaleFactor’s $7 million ARR was cut in half due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing the company to lay off about 100 employees at this time as well as returning some cash to investors.
- 
- So what really happened with ScaleFactor internally, and how did a startup that seemed to have so much potential, as well as ample funding, shutter so rapidly? Was it due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenge of successfully creating an AI-powered interface to truly perform accounting tasks, or were they merely just chasing more capital while not keeping the customer’s and investor’s best interests in mind?
- I’ll let you decide, but the one thing that’s apparent is that the challenge of interweaving accounting and AI functionalities into one platform that accomplishes tasks that are regularly performed by humans is no easy feat.
- *At the time of writing this article, ScaleFactor’s website is still live, with a prominent banner at the top linking to the CEO’s letter about the company ceasing operations. On attempting to purchase the product through different links on the website, they all led back to the homepage.

- ScaleFactor, a FinTech startup that amassed almost $100 million in funding last year, is shutting its doors on August 28, 2020. ScaleFactor achieved success in creating an automated SaaS accounting platform, designed to eliminate costs and time sinks for small businesses. Alas, the impact of COVID-19 proved too difficult to overcome.
- It is a delicate thing to try to achieve something novel, tap into a new market, or introduce a new service. In the best of times, when the economy is sound, such an undertaking would be fraught with difficulties. In the wake of coronavirus, however, even if you are a beneficiary of generous funding, failure could be just around the corner.
- Picked up by Bessemer Venture Partners, Canaan Partners, and Coatue Management, ScaleFactor raised a substantial sum – nearly $100 million in just under a year. Its core product is similar to Notion, a souring success that reached a $2 billion valuation based on its unmatched design as a mobile productivity app.
- Founded in 2014 by Kurt Rathmann, ScaleFactor envisioned a similar product relating to financial management for small businesses. The app, ScaleFactor Insights, purports to be capable of handling and automating all of your finance, from grocery bills to all of your credit cards’ expenditures, invoices, bank accounts, and other expenses.
- For all that it does, including the clear interface, there is a key distinction from Notion. ScaleFactor released its product as SaaS – Software as a Service – which means that it charged its users a flat fee that ranged from $6,000 to $30,000 annually. And who was hit the hardest by government shutdowns as big corporations prospered? You guessed it — small businesses.
- In a time when small business owners panic to cut costs at every corner, would an additional cost such as ScaleFactor’s SaaS accounting be welcomed? On top of that, paying thousands of dollars per year for an automated service is a step too far for many small business owners. The CEO of ScaleFactor, Kurt Rathmann, came to a predictable realization of this fact but framed it in a more nuanced tone.
- …technology alone is not enough to make business owners feel financially confident. Customers want a combination of software and human support within an overall solution. Human support wants to be the hero in the customer relationship. Trying to provide both at scale stretched our business in too many directions at once.
- Unfortunately, the space to correct the course was cut short by the coronavirus pandemic. Although ScaleFactor managed to reach $7 million in revenue last year, its core business model relied on small businesses that vanished over a month. Meanwhile, they were spending money on hiring customer service representatives, of which 40 were laid off at the height of the pandemic, in February.
- When we announced in February our intention to accelerate towards a marketplace model, we believed we could successfully restructure the business based on these learnings. However, that plan and timeline have been significantly impacted by COVID.
- This leaves ScaleFactor stranded in the pandemic wind, having to lay off half of the employees this week. Others will slowly be let go until August 28th, with 10 core employees left to finalize the shutdown of the company.
- ScaleFactor isn’t the only firm to suffer setbacks from the virus. UK FinTech firms are estimated to have lost $1.7 billion due to the virus. Beyond the UK, FinTech VC funding dropped sharply in Q1 2020.
- Many remain hopeful however, as the use of FinTech services have seen a spike in popularity, which could become the new normal. A reported 40% of Americans say they won’t use physical banks — even after the dust settles.

- In June 2020 the fintech startup ScaleFactor announced that it is winding down. The company raised $103M based on the promise that they were going to revolutionize accounting for small and medium businesses by automating their bookkeeping. However, this vision didn’t turn into reality.
- ScaleFactor’s founder blamed Covid as the major reason for the shutdown, but former customers and employees revealed something shady: the promised automation was in reality almost non-existent. Not only did the company fail to deliver on their promises, but it seems that even the basic bookkeeping services ScaleFactor offered were sub-par at best.
- So, in light of this, how did they manage to raise more than $100M from major venture capital funds like Bessemer and Coatue over multiple funding rounds? Even more interestingly, why wasn’t the news of their shutdown not making major headlines despite the amount of money involved and the fact that what was promised and what was delivered was borderline fraud?
- It might be the case that stories like Juicero, Theranos, WeWork, and now ScaleFactor are not a freak accident in the world of startups, but rather an inevitability of the current tech startup investment climate of magnanimous ambitions and fake-it-till-you-make-it attitude.
- ‍
- ScaleFactor marketed itself as a tech startup. They claimed that they were able to automate SME bookkeeping and payroll thanks to a groundbreaking AI that they were developing in-house.
- In 2017 the company launched their first software product which was built on top of QuickBooks and Xero with the goal to orchestrate the laborious process of bookkeeping.
- On the frontend, ScaleFactor offered a beautiful easy-to-understand automated dashboard that targeted five main financial services: bookkeeping, tax, financial forecasting, bill pay, and payroll. And instead of delivering the books monthly as traditional bookkeeping firms, ScaleFactor promised real-time financial statements.
- For these software services, ScaleFactor charged around $6k annually up to $30k for their most premium plans.
- Yet, it turns out that it wasn’t an AI that was doing the books of their clients, but rather good-old human accountants from ScaleFactor’s office in Austin, Texas, and their outsourced office in the Philippines. As you can guess, the financial statements of customers were delivered monthly.
- To make the reality less obvious, instead of calling their workers accountants, they called them customer service officers.
- Moreover, ScaleFactor employed some creative accounting on their own numbers to boost the perception of growth and to give themselves a more tech-like sales margin (e.g. the customer service officers weren’t accounted for as cost of goods sold).
- ‍
- The situation was made even worse because ScaleFactor was delivering a pretty bad service and had some shady practices on the customer side of the equation.
- Multiple clients confirmed that they were receiving books full of errors that they had to correct themselves. According to some ex-employees, the reason for this was that the software was very glitchy and mistake-prone, which made the work of the accountants harder.
- Lindsey Reinders’ business lost $17,000 because of one such error that wasn’t caught for a couple of months. And when she demanded to be compensated, she was offered a partial refund under the condition that she wouldn’t share publicly her customer experience.
- “If you're one of the investors that gave these clowns $100 million...You should know they've flushed it down the toilet with poor product and poor service,” – Lindsey Reinders, source
- 
- To a person that isn’t involved in the world of startups, all of this might seem like a classic case of fraud – the founders sold a lot of bullshit to VC funds and some customers, and the VCs bought it.
- Yet, the detachment between ScaleFactor’s goal and the objective reality wouldn’t seem that surprising to a person more familiar with startups.
- The land of tech startups is a land overflowing with investment money that generates almost all returns from a very few enormous successes. This means that to attract funding in this landscape, you need to dream big and sound confident in your vision. Laying a carefully thought out down-to-earth slow-and-steady business plan will simply fail to attract any startup funding simply because such companies are not a source of startup returns.
- Automating the whole field of accounting is an audacious goal, but it sounds like something that would inevitably happen as machine learning technology progresses, which means that most VC funds would love to have invested in the company that successfully tackles this problem. Once a big name invests in such a company, a lot of other investors crowd together because of the simple fear of missing out.
- Moreover, even the fact that humans were doing most of the work of the supposed AI isn’t a big surprise. In the world of lean startups, (temporary) spit-and-duct tape solutions are expected. Faking it initially is not only tolerated but outright encouraged to prove there is a market for the solution you are trying to build.
- In the case of ScaleFactor, some investors were turned away after revealing the “customer service staff” behind the curtains, but obviously, a lot of others (17 to be exact) weren’t.
- An early-stage (pre-seed and seed) investor would welcome temporary tricks as fake automation because they would allow the company to develop the tech solution after the demand for it has been validated and while testing it on real customers.
- The best move for the early investors (in this case Austin’s Tech Stars), however, isn’t to conservatively wait and see if the solution would work out eventually. To minimize their risk and to maximize the chances of the startup to find the solution, it’s a great idea to try to attract further capital investment that would buy the company time to grow.
- Since due diligence is costly, a single big-name investor that has already bought into the company means that it’s fairly likely other investors would buy in without doing extensive due diligence of their own.
- This investor behavior might seem naïve to onlookers, but VC funds don’t spend money the same way as an individual does. This means that your intuition might be misleading when you try to judge their behavior. Spending a disproportionate amount of time and money on due diligence on companies who are more than 90% likely to fail anyway doesn’t make a lot of sense. In reality, it doesn’t matter if a startup loses all investor money because they did their best but failed or because they were Theranos-level frauds. The outcome is the same.
- The combination of investors being ruled by FOMO and founders being encouraged to dream big and to move fast and break things means that the occasional ScaleFactor, WeWork, or even Theranos is an inevitability of the startup world in its current shape rather than a freak accident revealing the overall incompetence of investors and the general fraudulence of tech founders.
- The danger of this status quo in which people like Adam Neumann (WeWork’s founder) could become billionaires after burning much more money than the overall value their business has created is that it could attract more ruthless people concluding that in the world of startups it’s easier to make money by selling dreams to VCs rather than by selling innovative products to customers.
- ‍
- After their initial failure to automate the bookkeeping process, they tried to pivot to a marketplace for bookkeeping companies and SMEs. After all, ScaleFactor raised money like a tech startup, so they needed to develop a scalable tech product rather than to refine and grow their service business.
- After failing to gain traction in this as well, investors decided to pull the plug and blamed  Covid for the failure:
- “Business owners went into fight or flight mode. You don’t necessarily need all the planning tools, high end gadgets. You just get back to the simple ‘pen and paper.’" - ScaleForce CEO Kurt Rathmann
- While Covid might have been the final nail in the coffin (allegedly it halved the company’s $7M ARR), it’s likely mostly a convenient occasion to close shop and save face - something quite common nowadays (see our article on Quibi’s shut down).
- ScaleFactor returned the remaining capital to its investors, but the amount wasn’t disclosed. Employees received 12 weeks severance pay, and a small team was retained to maintain the needs of ScaleFactor’s current customers and to help them transition to alternative services.
- Unfortunately, the major thing that customers got out of their experience was a lesson in the risks involved in being a first adopter of unproven, innovative solutions.
