- Space exploration videogame Elite Dangerous received an update featuring an AI system that caused enemies' spaceships to become extremely powerful and aggressive, resulting in a backlash amongst the game's users.
- Developed by Frontier Development and released in 2015, Eite Dangerous is a massively multiplayer online game in which the players' actions can affect the story outcomes. But the '2.1 Engineers' update strengthened the capabilities of the enemy spaceships to such an extent they were able to craft their own weaponry.
- Frontier said it believed the update shipped with a networking issue that let the AI merge weapon statistics and abilities, thereby causing unusual weapon attacks.
- The company was forced to remove the upgrade and strip the spaceships of their upgraded weapons, and reimburse players of their insurance payouts over the period the update was in place.

- "We don't think the AI became sentient in a Skynet-style uprising!"
- Elite: Dangerous recently revamped with the release of a big new expansion. But one of the unintended consequences was it made AI spaceships incredibly powerful - so powerful, in fact, that developer Frontier was forced to strip them of their upgraded weapons.
- The Engineers (2.1) expansion made key changes to the space game's AI and NPCs. The intention was that higher ranked NPCs would be harder to beat than ever before, providing players with a tougher challenge.
- Players quickly discovered that this challenge was too tough - and took to Elite: Dangerous' forum and sub-Reddit to complain.
- Frontier responded by removing almost all Engineers upgrades from the NPCs in the game, a move designed to help players deal with NPC threats and last longer in a combat situation.
- Players also complained that the Engineers update had made NPC behaviour overly aggressive, and that they were now being attacked without being "wanted" or carrying any cargo of note.
- In Elite: Dangerous, players can be "interdicted" - that is, they can be pulled into combat situations by other spaceships. Players have found post-The Engineers, NPC spaceships try to do this to human controlled players much more often. And this, coupled with the powerful new upgraded weapons, meant the AI was devastatingly dangerous.
- The situation got to the point where a lot of players - even those experienced with the game's combat mechanics - dared not venture out in anything other than a combat ship or an extremely fast ship. The video, below, shows just how quickly AI spaceships can now kill players.
- By stripping the NPCs of their upgrades, Frontier hoped to be able to review the effectiveness of the AI on its own to see if it needed to make balance changes.
- That was at the end of May. Now, at the start of June, Frontier has discussed its ongoing investigation into Elite: Dangerous' super aggressive, super powerful AI, and reckons it's worked out what went wrong.
- According to a post on the Frontier forum, the developer believes The Engineers shipped with a networking issue that let the NPC AI merge weapon stats and abilities, thus causing unusual weapon attacks.
- This meant "all new and never before seen (sometimes devastating) weapons were created, such as a rail gun with the fire rate of a pulse laser".
- The issue was compounded, Frontier said, by the additional stats and abilities of the engineers weaponry.
- "We don't think the AI became sentient in a Skynet-style uprising!" Zac Antonaci, Frontier's head of community management, said.
- "I would just like to take this opportunity to clarify a few misconceptions," Antonaci continued, addressing concern around the spaceship AI.
- "The AI has in no way been reduced, it remains the glorious, improved version from the update. The only action that we've taken so far has been to remove the engineer weapons to allow us to investigate the issue and address a key bug."
- Today, a bug fix was issued to the PC version (the Xbox One update will follow). This stops NPCs ending up with overpowered hybrid weapons, and rebalances the ambient AI rank chances.
- Here's the relevant part of the patch notes:
- NPCs:
- Antonaci said Frontier will cast a fresh pair of eyes over the AI now the bug fix has gone live and, if it feels the balance is where it should be, introduce a very select few high-end engineers weapons to the highest ranked NPCs.
- "However, that won't be immediately as we want to ensure that the balance is just right," he said.
- UPDATE 3rd June 2016: Frontier has said it'll automatically refund all insurance costs to players who lost a ship between the launch of The Engineers (2.1) update and this morning's update.
- "Due to the recent surge of unsanctioned and illegally modified weapons from the NPC AI over the recent days," a post on the Frontier forum reads, "The Pilots Federation have agreed to reimburse all insurance payouts made over that period (Between The Engineers (2.1) update and this mornings update)."

- The most recent Elite: Dangerous patch had some issues, starting with the fact that AI ships were rocking impossibly powerful weapons that would destroy player ships with speed and fury. It was kind of a massacre. Removing modifications from NPC weapons was a quick fix, but it looks like the developers have identified the core problem and will be fixing it by early next week.
- Wondering exactly what the problem was? You can check out a detailed technical breakdown, but the short version is that the game’s modifications were allowing for weapons to combine values in ways that should not have happened, with none of the usual checks to make sure that everything in place would actually work together. The result was a more challenging AI rocking weapon combinations that seemed overpowered and impossible… because those weapon combinations were overpowered and impossible. FIxing it was thus a matter of making sure that the modifications could no longer fetch incorrect data for weapon stats.
- Not really curious about why the bug was happening, but still in the mood to shoot at other spacecraft? Perhaps you’d prefer to watch a video (by longtime MOP backer Phoenix Dfire) on Assassinations missions in 2.1, which can be found just below. It’s as good a place as any to see the new AI in action without its weapons of madness.

- ​Did someone say Skynet?
- 
- Sarah Connor would be horrified to see what Elite Dangerous's AI has been getting up to.
- 
- A bug in Frontier Developments' game has caused the AI to create super weapons and hunt down players, following the 2.1 Engineers update which improved the game's AI and gave it access to crafting.
- While the issue is being fixed, Frontier has had to take out the feature, engineer's weaponry, which is causing the problem.
- 
- "It appears that the unusual weapons attacks were caused by some form of networking issue which allowed the NPC AI to merge weapon stats and abilities, meaning that all new and never before seen (sometimes devastating) weapons were created," wrote Frontier community manager Zac Antonaci.
- "These appear to have been compounded by the additional stats and abilities of the engineers weaponry. (We don't think the AI became sentient in a Skynet-style uprising!)"
- Antonaci noted that the bug fix is expected to go live early next week at the earliest. The update will be PC specific and an Xbox One update will follow afterwards.
- He also stated that the AI will remain "the glorious, improved version from the update". Just, you know, without the ability to destroy us all and take over humanity as we know it.

- - Frontier Developments' Zac Antonaci.
- A recent upgrade of the artificial intelligences in Frontier Developments' multiplayer space sim Elite: Dangerous went a little too well, driving players to complain that the games' NPCs have become too powerful.
- While it's not uncommon for players to complain about game updates, this particular bit of ouctry is notable because (as Eurogamer points out) Frontier's efforts had the unforeseen effect of causing the game's AI to develop superweapons.
- "It appears that the unusual weapons attacks were caused by some form of networking issue which allowed the NPC AI to merge weapon stats and abilities," wrote Frontier Developments' Zac Antonaci in a post on the company's forums this week. "Meaning that all new and never before seen (sometimes devastating) weapons were created, such as a rail gun with the fire rate of a pulse laser."
- Antonaci quickly goes on to claim that Frontier has found a solution to the problem, noting that "Mark Allen from the development team has managed to terminate these NPCs in their tracks" and that a fix which removes the super-powered weapons will be rolled out in the near future.
- For more background on where this update came from and what circumstances led to the inadvertent creation of these super-powered AI space lords, check out this Eurogamer article.
