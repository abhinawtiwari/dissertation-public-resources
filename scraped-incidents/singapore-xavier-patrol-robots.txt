- Singapore government's Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX) has announced it is conducting a three-week test of robots that will scan the Toa Payoh neighbourhood for 'undesirable social behaviours'.
- These behaviours include the congregation of more than five people, smoking in prohibited areas, illegal hawking, improperly parked bicycles, and riding motorised active mobility devices and motorcycles on footpaths.
- The agency says the robots will be used for surveillance and public education during the trial, and will not be used for law enforcement. It went on to argue that robots are needed to address a labour crunch in an ageing society with a smaller workforce.

- SINGAPORE, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Singapore has started trialing robots to patrol public areas and deter poor social behaviour in its latest effort to further augment its strong portfolio of surveillance tools.
- Ranked one of the safest countries in the world, Singapore has put two autonomous robots on trial to detect bad behaviour such as flouting of COVID-19 safety measures, smoking in prohibited areas and the improper parking of bicycles, Singapore's Home Team Science and Technology Agency said in a statement on Sunday.
- It said the two patrol robots, named Xavier, are equipped with cameras that can detect bad social behaviour and trigger real-time alerts to the command and control centre.
- The trial is taking place at an area with high foot traffic in central Singapore.
- The agency said that during the three-week trial, the robots would be used for surveillance and displaying messages to educate the public on proper behaviour. A spokesperson from the agency said on Monday the robots would not be used for law enforcement during the trial.
- "The deployment of Xavier will support the work of public officers as it will reduce the manpower required for foot patrols and improve operation efficiency," the agency said.
- Singapore's home affairs minister, K Shanmugam, said in August the city-state aimed to have more than 200,000 police cameras by 2030, more than double the current number of cameras deployed across the island state in Southeast Asia.

- Singapore is known for having stringent laws and for having surveillance cameras all over the city-state. In the future, it may also deploy robots to keep an eye out for rule breakers — in fact, Singapore has started testing a robot named Xavier, putting a couple of them to work by having them patrol and survey a public area with high foot traffic. Over the next three weeks, the robots will monitor the crowds of Toa Payoh Central to look for what the nation's authorities describe as "undesirable social behaviors." Those bad behaviors include the "congregation of more than five people," which goes against its COVID-19 safety measures.
- In addition, the Xavier robots will look for instances of smoking in prohibited areas and illegal hawking. It will patrol the vicinity for improperly parked bicycles and for any mobility device and motorcycle using footpaths and sidewalks, as well. If the robot detects any of those behaviors, it will alert its command center and then display a corresponding message on its screen to educate the public.
- The machines are equipped with cameras capable of providing their command center with 360-degree views. They're also capable of capturing images in dim lighting using IR and low-light cameras. Plus, the video they capture will be analyzed by an AI system to look for anything that may require human officers' response. To enable the machines to navigate the city autonomously, they're fitted with sensors that give them the ability to avoid both stationary and moving objects, including pedestrians and vehicles.
- Singapore already announced its plans to double the number of its surveillance cameras to 200,000 over the next decade. Officials believe these robots can help augment those surveillance measures further, though, and reduce the need for officers to do physical patrols.

- Singapore is testing robots that patrol the streets looking for "undesirable social behaviours."
- The two robots, called "Xavier," have cameras that give them a 360-degree field of vision, and will search for people smoking in public, flouting COVID-19 rules, or illegally hawking, Singapore's Home Team Science and Technology Agency announced Sunday.
- Data from Xavier's cameras feeds into AI video analytics software, the agency said. "Once Xavier detects any of the above, it will trigger real-time alerts to the command and control centre," the agency said.
- Public officers can then "activate additional resources to respond to on-ground situations when necessary," it said.
- The two robots will rove around the high-footfall area of Toa Payoh Central, and as well as alerting officers they will display messages that "educate" the public, the agency said.

- "The deployment of Xavier will support the work of public officers as it will reduce the manpower required for foot patrols and improve operation efficiency," the agency said in its statement.
- This isn't the first time Singapore has turned to robots to help police its citizens. In May 2020, officials deployed robotics company Boston Dynamics' dog-like robot Spot in parks to tell people to stay at least one metre apart.
- Other countries have tried integrating robots into law enforcement. In June 2019, California's Huntington Park police department deployed an egg-shaped robot named Robocop, which was essentially a mobile CCTV camera.
- In December 2020, the New York Police Department also trialed the Spot robot, but canceled its contract with Boston Dynamics in May after public outcry.

- One of the safest countries in the world, Singapore recently launched patrolling robots to thwart bad social behaviour on streets. Two such autonomous robots, named Xavier, fully-equipped with cameras and other surveillance tools were spotted in Toa Payoh, earlier this week.
- The Home Team Science and Technology Agency of Singapore have introduced these robots to raise surveillance fine those flouting Covid-19 safety protocols. The team also aims to reduce other issues like improper bicycle parking, illegal hawking and smoking in prohibited areas with the help of robot patrolling in the country. While the trail has received a green signal for three weeks, Singapore aims to strengthen surveillance with modern technology.

- Meanwhile, the autonomous robot Xavier is equipped with a 360-degree vision which is capable of scanning in the dark as well. These robots also feature pre-recorded messages like: 'Please do not smoke in prohibited areas such as covered walkways' to educate people on appropriate public behavior. Xavier is also equipped with real-time alerts (which are instantly sent to the command and control center) that are triggered when it detects any poor social behavior. While the main objective is to collect data to improve the system, the trial phase of these robots is being used to monitor, educate and raise awareness about the appropriate behavior in public.
- Deployed in Toa Payoh, Xavier has been equipped with various kinds on sensors to enable it to navigate through the busy streets while avoiding obstructions like vehicles and pedestrians while patrolling. Meanwhile, the spokesperson from Home Team Science and Technology Agency also highlighted the point that the deployment of Xavier will also help the government to reduce the manpower required to patrol the streets in Singapore.
- While Xavier is the first to patrol the streets, Singapore has deployed other robots like Matar, Swan, O-R3 and Spot to monitor water quality, promote the message of safe and social distancing and other activities in the past few months.

- A SINISTER robot is patrolling streets filming "undesirable behaviours" and sending videos to Singapore police in a new crackdown.
- Within seconds, the footage is sent to central command and fed into a video analytics system for processing.
- The culprit's actions are logged and the robots blurts out a message warning them to spot.
- For example, if someone's caught lighting up in a no-smoking zone, Xavier will crawl up and examine your posture, the outline of the cigarette in your mouth, and other visuals before it sending out a pre-recorded message to "not smoke in prohibited areas such as covered walkways".
- The menacing bot is being rolled on the streets Toa Payoh Central and will be used to chase down people ignoring no-smoking zones, illegal hawkers, motorcycle or e-scooter riders on footpaths and gatherings that exceed the current limit on group sizes.
- Xavier is the latest machine being used by Singapore cops to monitor streets since the outbreak of Covid-19.
- Last year, law enforcement authorities used the Multi-purpose All-Terrain Autonomous Robot (Matar) to patrol the National Day Parade and enforce Covid-19 restrictions at a government quarantine facility and foreign worker dormitory during the pandemic.
- They also used a robot known as O-R3 to enforce social distancing rules during the nation's circuit breaker lockdown last year and Spot, a four-legged robot that resembled a dog, at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.
- Spot was used to broadcast messages urging people to observe social distancing measures and had cameras that allowed it to estimate the number of visitors in the park at one time.
- Xavier has a 360-degree field of vision, better suspension, facial recognition software, can see in the dark, and will be able to alert cops in real time.
- This is the first time an anonymous robot is being tested in a busy public area and is said to involve five public agencies.
- Cops say Xavier will be used for "education and deterrence" rather than enforcement.
- Cheng Wee Kiang from the Home Team Science and Technology Agency, which is one of five agencies involved in the project, said: "We gave this robot a new lease of life and expanded its capabilities.
- "After we analyse the results, we will make the necessary arrangements to destroy the data."
- Xavier is fitted with sensors so it can avoid objects and is programmed to follow a pre-configured patrol route.
- Officer can also respond to incidents remotely using Xavier's two-way intercom.

- For the first time, Singapore is trailing ground robots on its streets to patrol and survey a public area with high foot traffic to augment the work of public officers and deter poor social behaviour.
- The trials are being conducted via joint project involving five public agencies, namely HTX (Home Team Science and Technology Agency), National Environment Agency, Land Transport Authority, Singapore Food Agency, and Housing & Development Board.
- Ranked one of the safest countries in the world, Singapore has put two autonomous robots on trial to detect bad behaviour such as flouting of COVID-19 safety measures, smoking in prohibited areas and the improper parking of bicycles, Singapore's Home Team Science and Technology Agency said in a statement on Sunday.

- Singapore's home affairs minister, K Shanmugam, said in August the city-state aimed to have more than 200,000 police cameras by 2030, more than double the current number of cameras deployed across the island state in Southeast Asia.
- Being one of the word’s most vaccinated countries, Singapore is taking new steps to slow a rampant increase in Covid-19 cases but can’t rule out returning to closing restaurants and restricting public life if serious infections continue to rise.
- “We have to slow down the transmission rate," Finance Minister and co-chair of the government’s virus taskforce Lawrence Wong said Monday. “We will attempt to do so without going back to another heightened alert. These are last-resort measures and we will try our best to refrain from using them, but we should not rule them out entirely."

- Trial of robots to police ‘undesirable’ behaviour such as smoking or breaching social-distancing rules
- Singapore has trialled patrol robots that blast warnings at people engaging in “undesirable social behaviour”, adding to an arsenal of surveillance technology in the tightly controlled city-state that is fuelling privacy concerns.
- From vast numbers of CCTV cameras to trials of lampposts kitted out with facial recognition tech, Singapore is seeing an explosion of tools to track its inhabitants.
- That includes a three-week trial in September, in which two robots were deployed to patrol a housing estate and a shopping centre.
- Officials have long pushed a vision of a hyper-efficient, tech-driven “smart nation”, but activists say privacy is being sacrificed and people have little control over what happens to their data.
- Singapore is frequently criticised for curbing civil liberties and people are accustomed to tight controls, but there is still growing unease at intrusive tech.
- The government’s latest surveillance devices are robots on wheels, with seven cameras, that issue warnings to the public and detect “undesirable social behaviour”.
- This includes smoking in prohibited areas, improperly parking bicycles, and breaching coronavirus social-distancing rules.
- During a recent patrol, one of the “Xavier” robots wove its way through a housing estate and stopped in front of a group of elderly residents watching a chess match.
- “Please keep one-metre distancing, please keep to five persons per group,” a robotic voice blared out, as a camera on top of the machine trained its gaze on them.
- Frannie Teo, a 34-year-old research assistant, was walking through the mall during the recent robot patrol trial.
- “It reminds me of Robocop,” she said.
- It brings to mind a “dystopian world of robots ... I’m just a bit hesitant about that kind of concept,” she added.
- Digital rights activist Lee Yi Ting said the devices were the latest way Singaporeans were being watched.
- “It all contributes to the sense people ... need to watch what they say and what they do in Singapore to a far greater extent than they would in other countries,” she told Agence France-Presse.
- But the government defended its use of robots, saying they were not being used to identify or take action against offenders during the tech’s trial, and were needed to address a labour crunch as the population ages.
- “The workforce is actually shrinking,” said Ong Ka Hing, from the government agency that developed the Xavier robots, adding they could help reduce the number of officers needed for foot patrols.
- The island of about 5.5 million people has 90,000 police cameras, a number set to double by 2030, and facial recognition tech – which helps authorities pick out faces in a crowd – may be installed on lampposts across the city.
- There was a rare public backlash this year when authorities admitted coronavirus contract-tracing data collected by an official system had been accessed by police. The government later passed legislation to limit its use.
- But critics say the city-state’s laws generally put few limitations on government surveillance, and Singaporeans have little control over what happens to the data collected.
- “There are no privacy law constraints on what the government can or cannot do,” said Indulekshmi Rajeswari, a privacy lawyer from Singapore who is now based in Germany.
