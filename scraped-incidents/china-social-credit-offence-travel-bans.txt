- BEIJING (AP) — Skipped paying a fine in China? Then forget about buying an airline ticket.
- Would-be air travelers were blocked from buying tickets 17.5 million times last year for “social credit” offenses including unpaid taxes and fines under a controversial system the ruling Communist Party says will improve public behavior.
- Others were barred 5.5 million times from buying train tickets, according to the National Public Credit Information Center. In an annual report, it said 128 people were blocked from leaving China due to unpaid taxes.
- The ruling party says “social credit” penalties and rewards will improve order in a fast-changing society after three decades of economic reform have shaken up social structures. Markets are rife with counterfeit goods and fraud. The system is part of efforts by President Xi Jinping’s government to use technology ranging from data processing to genetic sequencing and facial recognition to tighten control.
- Authorities have experimented with “social credit” since 2014 in areas across China. Points are deducted for breaking the law or, in some areas, offenses as minor as walking a dog without a leash.
- Human rights activists say “social credit” is too rigid and might unfairly label people as untrustworthy without telling them they have lost status or how to restore it.
- U.S. Vice President Mike Pence criticized it in October as “an Orwellian system premised on controlling virtually every facet of human life.”
- The ruling party wants a nationwide system by 2020 but has yet to say how it will operate. Possible penalties include restrictions on travel, business and access to education. A slogan repeated in state media says, “Once you lose trust, you will face restrictions everywhere.”
- Companies on the blacklist can lose government contracts or access to bank loans or be barred from issuing bonds or importing goods.
- Offenses penalized under “social credit” last year included false advertising or violating drug safety rules, the government information center said. Individuals were blocked 290,000 times from taking senior management jobs or acting as a company’s legal representative.
- Since the launch of such “joint punishment,” the system has caused 3.5 million people to “voluntarily fulfill their legal obligations,” the Information Center said. It said that included 37 people who paid a total of 150 million yuan ($22 million) in overdue fines or confiscations.
- The report gave no details of how many people live in areas with “social credit” systems.
- “Social credit” is one facet of efforts by the ruling party to take advantage of increased computing power, artificial intelligence and other technology to track and control the Chinese public.
- The police ministry launched an initiative dubbed “Golden Shield” in 2000 to build a nationwide digital network to track individuals.
- Human rights activists say people in Muslim and other ethnic minority areas have been compelled to give blood samples for a genetic database. Those systems rely on foreign technology. That has prompted criticism that U.S. and European suppliers might be enabling human rights abuses.
- This week, Waltham, Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. said it no longer would sell or service genetic sequencers in the Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang in the northwest following complaints they were used for surveillance.
- As many as 1 million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang are detained in political education camps, according to U.S. officials and United Nations experts. The government says those camps are vocational training centers designed to rid the region of extremism.

- SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China said it will begin applying its so-called social credit system to flights and trains and stop people who have committed misdeeds from taking such transport for up to a year.
- People who would be put on the restricted lists included those found to have committed acts like spreading false information about terrorism and causing trouble on flights, as well as those who used expired tickets or smoked on trains, according to two statements issued on the National Development and Reform Commission’s website on Friday.
- Those found to have committed financial wrongdoings, such as employers who failed to pay social insurance or people who have failed to pay fines, would also face these restrictions, said the statements which were dated March 2.
- It added that the rules would come into effect on May 1.
- The move is in line with President’s Xi Jinping’s plan to construct a social credit system based on the principle of “once untrustworthy, always restricted”, said one of the notices which was signed by eight ministries, including the country’s aviation regulator and the Supreme People’s Court.
- China has flagged plans to roll out a system that will allow government bodies to share information on its citizens’ trustworthiness and issue penalties based on a so-called social credit score.
- However, there are signs that the use of social credit scoring on domestic transport could have started years ago. In early 2017, the country’s Supreme People’s Court said during a press conference that 6.15 million Chinese citizens had been banned from taking flights for social misdeeds.

- It sounds like the plot line from an episode of Black Mirror set in a dystopian future, but China's “social credit” system has already seen over 12 million people slapped with domestic travel bans as punishment for bad behaviour.
- Nine million Chinese have been banned from buying domestic flights, and three million more from buying business class tickets in early trials of the scheme, under which citizens are rated on their compliance with social norms and rules.
- Behaviour that triggered the bans varied from obstructing footpaths with electric bikes to failing to pay fines.
- Zhang Yong, deputy director of the China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), said the trials were taking place across China’s provinces over the next two years.
- The social credit system is based on the government’s phrase “once untrustworthy, always restricted”, and is set to be tested further on the country’s train system from May 1, it was announced last week.
- From that date violating a new set of transport-related offences listed by the NDRC and China’s Supreme Court could result in travel bans.
- Smoking cigarettes in no smoking areas of trains, riding a train without a correct ticket and selling counterfeit tickets were among the offences listed, that could result in 180 day bans from buying train tickets.
- Mr Zhang said that the NDRC will "increase the intensity of joint rewards and punishments so that dishonest people will be punished and the faithful will be motivated".
- Those punished under the system will also be shamed online by having their names listed on a train ticket booking website for one week.
- Human rights groups are concerned that as the system is fully implemented around 2020, it may widen its use of apps and citizens’ social media behaviour to rate them, including using information about political allegiances.
- The Chinese government is watching the progress of Sesame Credit: a private credit system run by Ant Financial, a firm affiliated with Chinese retail giant Alibaba.
- The system judges users on behaviour such as how long they play video games for and what products they buy online, giving them a ‘score’ that many users share on Chinese social media. A spokesperson for Sesame Credit told The Telegraph that it does not share private user information with the government “unless compelled to do so for legal reasons”.
- Johan Lagerkvist, Chinese internet specialist at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, told Wired: "It is very ambitious in both depth and scope, including scrutinising individual behaviour and what books people are reading. It's Amazon's consumer tracking with an Orwellian political twist.”

- The Chinese state is setting up a vast ranking system system that will monitor the behaviour of its enormous population, and rank them all based on their "social credit."
- The "social credit system," first announced in 2014, aims to reinforce the idea that "keeping trust is glorious and breaking trust is disgraceful," according to a government document.
- The program is due to be fully operational by 2020, but is being piloted for millions of people already. The scheme is mandatory.
- At the moment the system is piecemeal — some are run by city councils, others are scored by private tech platforms which hold personal data.
- Like private credit scores, a person's social score can move up and down depending on their behaviour. The exact methodology is a secret — but examples of infractions include bad driving, smoking in non-smoking zones, buying too many video games and posting fake news online.
- 
- 1. Banning you from flying or getting the train.
- China has already started punishing people by restricting their travel.
- Nine million people with low scores have been blocked from buying tickets for domestic flights, Channel News Asia reported in March, citing official statistics.
- They can also clamp down on luxury options — three million people are barred from getting business-class train tickets.
- The eventual system will punish bad passengers specifically. Potential misdeeds include trying to ride with no ticket, loitering in front of boarding gates, or smoking in no-smoking areas.
- 2. Throttling your internet speeds.
- This is according to Rachel Botsman, an author who published part of her book on tech security on Wired last year. The exact mechanics aren't clear yet.
- According to Foreign Policy, credit systems monitor whether people pay bills on time, much like financial credit trackers — but also ascribe a moral dimension.
- Other mooted punishable offences include spending too long playing video games, wasting money on frivolous purchases and posting on social media.
- Spreading fake news, specifically about terrorist attacks or airport security, will also be punishable offences.
- 3. Banning you or your kids from the best schools.
- 17 people who refused to carry out military service last year were barred from enrolling in higher education, applying for high school, or continuing their studies, Beijing News reported.
- Citizens with low social credit would also be prohibited from enrolling their children at high-paying private schools, Botsman said. It's not clear whether this particular policy has been put into action yet.
- 4. Stopping you getting the best jobs.
- "Trust-breaking" individuals would also be banned from doing management jobs in state-owned firms and big banks.
- Some crimes, like fraud and embezzlement, would also have a big effect on social credit, Botsman reported.
- 5. Keeping you out of the best hotels.
- People who refused military service were also banned from some holidays and hotels — showing that vacation plans are fair game too.
- The regime rewards people here as well as punishes them.
- People with good scores can speed up travel applications to places like Europe, Botsman said.
- An unidentified woman in Beijing also told the BBC in 2015 that she was able to book a hotel without having to pay a cash deposit because she had a good score.
- 6. Being publicly named as a bad citizen.
- Naming and shaming is another tactic available. A a 2016 government notice encourages companies to consult the blacklist before hiring people or giving them contracts.
- However, people will be notified by the courts before they are added to the list, and are allowed to appeal against the decision within ten days of receiving the notification.
- It's not clear when the list will start to be implemented.
- A prototype blacklist already exists, and has been used to punish people.
- The scrolling list on the left shows individual's names alongside partially redacted ID numbers, while the one on the right shows company names.
- Li Xiaolin, a lawyer who was placed on the list in 2015, found himself unable to purchase plane tickets home while on a work trip, Human Rights Watch reported. He also couldn't apply for credit cards.
- There is also a list for good citizens — that will reportedly get you more matches on dating websites.
- The BBC said that Baihe, China's biggest dating site, is boosting the profiles of good citizens.
- They can also get discounts on energy bills, rent things without deposits, and get better interest rates at banks.
- These perks were available to people in Rongcheng, eastern China, whose city council rolled out a social credit system for its citizens and was profiled by Foreign Policy.
- Despite the creepiness of the system — Human Rights Watch called it "chilling," while Botsman called it "a futuristic vision of Big Brother out of control" — some citizens say it's making them better people already.
- A 32-year-old entrepreneur, who only gave his name as Chen, told Foreign Policy: "I feel like in the past six months, people’s behaviour has gotten better and better.
- "For example, when we drive, now we always stop in front of crosswalks. If you don’t stop, you will lose your points.
- "At first, we just worried about losing points, but now we got used to it."

- Some residents of a growing number of Chinese cities are benefiting from personal credit scoring systems provided by local authorities, easing access to bank loans and public services such as libraries and transportation.
- On the flip side, banks in Zhejiang province told a businessman in January that he was ineligible to borrow because of fines unpaid since 2012 for violating the one-child policy, according to creditchina.gov.cn, a government-backed social credit website.
- As personal credit ratings become ubiquitous in Chinese people’s everyday lives, criticism of the local rating systems is mounting. Applying nonfinancial data to credit decisions isn’t fair, and neither is using social credit scores to determine access to social services, some critics say. And the potential for data leaks from the massive scoring systems could put many millions of Chinese people at risk.
- “The idea of using a credit scoring system to fix all kinds of social issues is unrealistic and even harmful,” said Wang Lu, a former official at the central bank’s credit rating department.
- China is taking a unique approach to social credit scoring compared with developed Western economies in North America and Europe. In many countries, private, third-party companies such as Experian and TransUnion provide individual ratings for lenders, landlords and others based mostly on people’s financial histories.
- Some city authorities in China compile a wide range of public records related to people’s behavior, from borrowing histories to violations such as breaking nonsmoking rules and evading subway tickets. This generates profiles of individuals’ creditworthiness and links scores to people’s access to public services, welfare, school admission, employment, job promotions and business undertakings.
- Since the first 12 cities including Hangzhou, Nanjing and Xiamen initiated local personal credit scoring system in December 2017, nearly 20 cities have created similar official systems, and more are on the way. The local systems are part of an enduring national campaign following a 2003 central government initiative to build up social credit systems in China and make credit records an important part of social life.
- Last year, the central bank consolidated a range of private, third-party credit rating enterprises including Tencent Credit and Ant Financial Services Group’s Zhima Credit into a unified personal information platform called Baihang Credit Scoring. The system compiles credit ratings based on individuals’ financial histories for use by banks and other financial institutions.
- In the government work report to the March legislative meeting, Premier Li Keqiang reaffirmed efforts to set up social credit systems and proposed the idea of credit-based supervision as part of the government’s pledge to reform the social governance mechanism.
- In Fuzhou, the capital of the southern province of Fujian, a construction company recently found it could get a 10% discount on bank services, thanks to a sound Jasmine score for the company’s legal representative. The Jasmine score, named after Fuzhou’s city flower, is the city’s personal credit reference. A rising number of financial and public institutions in the city are using the Jasmine score for citizens, offering greater convenience to those with high scores.
- But the broad use of personal credit scores to determine people’s access to public services has raised fairness concerns. Some experts argued that the practice may abuse people’s rights by assessing personal credit using factors unrelated to trustworthiness.
- “The essential purpose of credit information is to help (financial institutions) assess customers’ risk exposure,” said Lai Jinchang, a tech expert at the World Bank's International Finance Corp., in a speech. “It should not be imposed with too many (other) factors.” Lai said the concept of a social credit system is an experiment in China that is unprecedented anywhere else.
- Heated debate
- Suining County in Jiangsu province was the first in China to initiate a personal credit scoring system in 2010. Rating residents’ credit by four levels, city authorities took into account a wide range of factors including contributions to local investment and records on spreading rumors online, which stirred debate over whether noncredit-related records should be included.
- In 2016, neighboring Suzhou launched its Osmanthus score, also named for the city flower, covering its 13 million people. Authorities collect data from local departments including public security, social welfare, civil affairs, commerce administration and family planning to analyze people’s creditworthiness. For instance, people get extra credit for participating in volunteer activities or deductions for traffic violations.

- Legal experts have voiced concern that local authorities may abuse the concept of credit in their rating systems. Liu Chunquan, a lawyer at the Shanghai Duan & Duan Law Firm, said credit scores should simply reflect individuals’ ability to make repayments rather than their character. “Otherwise, it will be misleading,” Liu said.
- A central bank official said some local governments have extended the idea of credit scoring by taking into account a broad range of factors that are actually unrelated to personal credit.
- “How does running a red light relate to personal credit?” one credit rating professional said.
- The use of credit scores in social management also drew the concern of some legal experts. Many cities with credit scoring systems have imposed punitive measures such as limits on public services for people with lower scores. Some cities have cited credit scores as a reason to deny people’s access to bank loans, public transportation or even their children’s school admissions, according to several legal experts.
- “What is their legal basis?” asked one expert.
- Local governments’ wide use of personal behavior records in measuring creditworthiness may create room for dodgy business, the credit rating professional said.
- A court in Changsha, Hunan province, recently tried a local police officer accused of accepting 42 million yuan ($6.3 million) in bribes for helping people erase their traffic violation records, a factor included in the local credit scoring system. A court decision is pending.
- The ways many local governments use the credit scores are too careless, experts said.
- “Authorities should use personal credit scores prudently, as it can have profound impacts on people’s basic rights,” said Wang Xinrui, a senior partner at Beijing Anli Partners. “It should be fully justified.”
- Much to do
- Governments’ massive collection of personal data for credit scoring has also raised concern over the protection of privacy. Whether local governments have the financial and technical capability to maintain and ensure the security of their huge systems for gathering personal information remains a question, several credit industry sources said.
- “If there are data leaks, it will not only cause huge economic losses but also hurt the governments’ reputation,” said an expert at the Ministry of Public Security.
- Experts are calling for clearer guidance to define the scope for local authorities to collect and use personal data.
- “There should be legal arrangements to spell out what kind of information can be collected and under what circumstances,” said Liu at Shanghai Duan & Duan. “The core issue is that personal credit should not be abused.”
- Currently, credit scoring-related businesses and activities are under the supervision of both the central bank and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). While the central bank oversees credit assessment in financial sectors under the 2013 Regulation on the Administration of Credit Investigation Industry, the NDRC supervises a broader range of credit-related business in the economy.
- But there are gaps and inconsistencies between regulations of the two authorities. For instance, the NDRC in October approved 26 agencies in a pilot program to provide credit scoring-related services, even though some of them were previously rejected by the central bank for credit scoring services.
- Industry insiders and legal experts are demanding unified regulations and an overarching law to govern the fledgling social credit-scoring sector. However, such legislation may not soon materialize.
- At this year’s national legislative meeting in March, the National People’s Congress listed social credit-related legislation among class-three agenda tasks, meaning the work isn’t ready and requires further study.

- Millions of people in China last year were barred from traveling and even getting a better job because of their failure to pay fines, among other minor offenses.
- China’s National Public Credit Information Center on Friday released a report that said it stopped 17.5 million people from buying airplane tickets and 5.5 million from hopping on a train in 2018 because they had low “social credit” scores. Another 290,000 people were stopped from getting a high-paying senior management job and 128 people couldn’t leave the country because they hadn’t yet paid taxes, according to the Associated Press, which obtained a copy of the report.
- Since 2014, China has been testing out a social credit system that takes points away from people for minor offenses. So, if people don’t pay fines on time, fail to pay their taxes, or even engage in false advertising, their social credit scores could drop. The Chinese government has called the social credit system an opportunity for its country to run more effectively and reduce poor behavior. The U.S. and its allies, however, have said that it infringes upon people’s rights and gives the government too much control.
- Chinese citizens living under the system have little leverage in improving their social credit scores without paying their fines. In addition to restricting travel and hurting job prospects, the Chinese government also uses its social credit system to limit access to education.
- For now, social credit systems are still being tested across the country. A national social credit system that covers every single citizen has yet to roll out. But some China-watchers believe it’s only a matter of time until that happens.
- According to the AP, state media coverage in China touted the report’s findings. The outlets also parroted the program’s slogan: “once you lose trust, you will face restrictions everywhere.”

- Children in China could reportedly be banned from going to elite schools if the social credit system judges their family as “untrustworthy”.
- The Chinese government has used the technology to block passengers from buying plane and train tickets for up to a year as a punishment for offences.
- Those who fell foul of the system have been accused of committing financial or legal wrongdoings.
- They could also face limits on their children’s education choices, which would restrict them to ordinary state schools, according to Liu Guixiang, a member of the Supreme People’s Court’s judicial committee.
- If the school’s fees are higher than those of normal schools, he said it is considered “luxury” spending, The Daily Mail reported.

- The children would then be restricted from attending if their tuition fees were paid by the person who has been discredited.
- Mr Liu also claimed the system would not punish anyone incorrectly or penalise family members in order to put pressure upon them, and called the Chinese legal system “very civilised”.
- The move to put citizens on restricted lists is in line with Chinese president Xi Jinping’s plan to construct a system based on the principle: “Once untrustworthy, always restricted.”
- Last year, US vice-president Mike Pence denounced it as “an Orwellian system premised on controlling virtually every facet of human life”.
- Offences include committing acts such as spreading false information about terrorism and causing trouble on flights, as well as using expired tickets or smoking on trains.
- People could also be punished for failing to pay fines or other financial wrongdoings.
