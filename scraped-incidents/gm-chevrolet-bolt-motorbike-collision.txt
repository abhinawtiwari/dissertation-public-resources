- 
- The Chevrolet Bolt or Chevrolet Bolt EV is a battery electric subcompact hatchback produced by General Motors under the Chevrolet marque. It was developed and manufactured in partnership with LG Corporation.[6] A rebadged European variant was sold as the Opel Ampera-e in mainland Europe, but was discontinued after 2018.
- Sales of the 2017 Bolt began in California in December 2016, with nationwide US and international markets release in 2017.[7][8] The Bolt was the U.S. second best selling plug-in car in 2017. Global combined Bolt/Ampera-e family sales totaled 112,000 units by the end of 2020.
- The Bolt was named the 2017 Motor Trend Car of the Year, the 2017 North American Car of the Year,[9] an Automobile magazine 2017 All Star, and was listed in Time magazine's Best 25 Inventions of 2016.[10]
- The Bolt has been subject to a number of recalls, with concerns over the battery pack spontaneously catching fire. In August 2021, GM issued a statement advising owners to park in open areas, at least 50 feet (15 m) away from other vehicles, due to the possibility of the battery pack catching fire.[11]
- The Bolt will be discontinued in late 2023 to make room for GM's "new generation of electric vehicles."[12]
- GM Korea began developing the Bolt in 2012 with a team of 180 people with the project code G2KCZ (G2 for Gamma 2nd-generation platform, K for hatchback, C for Chevrolet, and Z for electric car).[13][14] Its initial concept debuted at the 2015 North American International Auto Show.[15]
- As of June 2015[update], General Motors had tested more than 50 Bolt prototypes hand-built at the General Motors Proving Grounds in Milford, Michigan. The cars were tested at Proving Grounds and overseas for ride and handling dynamics, cabin comfort, quietness, charging capability, and energy efficiency.[16]
- Alan Batey, head of General Motors North America, announced in February 2015 that the Bolt EV was headed for production, and would be available in all 50 states.[17] GM also has plans to sell the Bolt in select global markets.[18]
- In January 2016, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the production version of the Chevrolet Bolt was unveiled. During GM CEO Mary Barra's keynote at the show, Chevrolet confirmed an estimated range of 200 miles (320 km) or more, an approximate US$30,000 price tag (after government incentives), and stated it would be available in late 2016.[19] Barra projected in February 2016 that the European version, marketed as the Opel Ampera-e (or Vauxhall Ampera-e in the United Kingdom), would enter production in 2017.[20]
- In March 2016, GM released photos and a short pre-production video of the Bolt at the company's Orion Assembly plant outside Detroit, testing manufacturing and tooling.[21]
The car's user interface was developed in Israel.[22]
- An unnamed source cited by Bloomberg News estimated that General Motors is expected to take a loss of US$8,000 to US$9,000 per Bolt sold. A GM spokesman declined to comment about expected profitability.[23] Opel refuted that in December 2016 and stated that GM has battery cell costs of $130/kWh, and industry is not yet optimized for mass production.[24] A UBS tear-down in 2017 suggested slightly smaller losses per vehicle, of $7418 on a base spec, or $5520 on a higher spec vehicle.[25] They estimate that by 2025 the Bolt will make a profit of about $6000 per vehicle.
- Final assembly takes place at GM's Orion Assembly plant in Orion Township, Michigan,[26] which received a US$160 million upgrade for Bolt production.[18] Manufacture of the battery, motor, and drive unit started in August 2016 at LG, Incheon, South Korea.[27]
- The car is designed for flexible production by having some of the battery in the same position as the fuel tank in internal combustion engine-powered cars, and is made on the same assembly line as the Chevrolet Sonic[28][29] at a combined rate of 90,000 per year.[30] Although the car is assembled near Detroit, it has only 20% domestic-parts content.[31]
- Analysts expected Bolt production at 22,000 per year, and Ampera-e at a few thousand.[32] Production may increase to 30,000 to 50,000 per year according to demand.[33] Regular production was expected to begin in October 2016 at 25,000-30,000 the first year.[34][35] Initial regular production had begun by early November 2016[36] at a rate of 9 per hour, gradually increasing to 30 per hour.[37] Retail deliveries began in California in December 2016.[7][needs update]
- Bolt production was halted on August 23, 2021, while battery production was redirected to replacements under a recall affecting the 140,000 Bolt EVs that had been produced up to that time.[38] Production was not restarted until April 4, 2022.[39]
- In January 2022, GM announced the Orion Township factory would be retooled at a cost of $4 billion to produce Chevrolet Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV pickup trucks, starting in 2024. The retooling would start immediately, and truck production is scheduled to start in 2024, while Bolt EV and EUV production would continue until retooling was complete.[40] The affordable segment targeted by the Bolt is expected to be filled by the Chevrolet Equinox EV as GM transitions its EVs to Ultium technology.[41]
- In November 2020, 50,932 Chevrolet Bolt vehicles of model year 2017–2019 were recalled due to potential fire risk.[42] According to GM, these vehicles contained high voltage batteries produced at LG Chem's Ochang plant that may pose a risk of fire "when charged to full, or very close to full, capacity".[43]
- As a precautionary measure, Chevrolet issued software updates that allow dealers to install a battery charge limit of 90% to their existing inventory while urging current 2017–2019 Chevy Bolt owners to enable the "Hill Top Reserve" option (2017-2018MY) or to set vehicle "Target Charge Level" (2019-2022MY) to 90%. A final software update was expected to remedy the charging capacity to 100% sometime in April 2021.[44] As of November 2020[update], the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has confirmed five known fires with two injuries and recommends parking recalled vehicles outside, away from homes, until they have been repaired.[42]
- On August 20, 2021, Chevrolet extended the recall to include all Bolt models (both EV and EUV) and model years (2017-2022) totaling the number of recalled Chevy Bolt cars to nearly 142,000.[45] GM will replace the recalled vehicles' batteries, citing manufacturing defects by its partner LG, which could be responsible for the shorting of deficient battery cells. Amid further investigation, GM says it will ramp up production of replacement battery cells with LG Chem, while seeking reimbursement for the recall from the manufacturer,[46] as GM expects the expense to be $1.8 billion.[47] LG Chem had to pay $1.9 billion to GM. Some of the recalled battery packs were repurposed in grid batteries.[48]
- Cars which have had the battery-replacement recall done have the 259 mi (417-kilometre) range of the 2020-up Bolt, and the new batteries are warrantied for 8 years from the date of installation.[49]
- The Bolt was designed from 2012 by a team of 180 people in GM's Korea[14] studio (formerly Daewoo Korea), as B-segment size[50] on its own platform, the GM BEV2.[51] It does not share elements with the GM Gamma platform cars like the Chevrolet Sonic/Spark.[52][53]
- The EPA classifies the Bolt as "small station wagon", with less than 130 cu ft of interior volume.[3][54] GM refers to the Bolt as a crossover and puts it under the category of SUV on its website.[55][56] The passenger volume is 94 cu ft (2,700 L), and cargo space is 17 cu ft (480 L)[57] (381 liter).[58]
- The Bolt's doors, tailgate, and hood are aluminum.[50] The driver can adjust the level of regenerative braking as the accelerator pedal is lifted.[59] The front seats are asymmetrical to maximize cabin volume while accommodating airbags.[60]
- GM planned for over-the-air software updates during 2017[61] but the feature was finally released to the Bolt in April 2018.[62]
- The Cruise AV is a Bolt EV-based autonomous vehicle developed and tested by Cruise Automation, whose majority owner is General Motors; GM acquired Cruise in March 2016.[63]
- Pre-production versions of the Bolt EV were built at Orion Assembly in March 2016 and sent to Cruise, who modified the cars by adding sensors in San Francisco.[64] The modified pre-production vehicles were photographed in San Francisco in May.[65] This fleet of 50 1st-generation (G1) Bolt EV-based Cruise AVs were tested starting from June 2016 in the San Francisco Bay Area and Scottsdale, Arizona.[63]
- With the acquisition by GM in March 2016, Cruise also began working with GM engineers to develop the 2nd-generation (G2) Cruise AV, which would be assembled alongside regular production Bolt EVs at Orion Assembly.[66] Externally, the G1 Cruise AV is equipped with two roof-mounted LIDAR sensors, has four small round headlights, and retains the Chevrolet "bowtie" logo on the front grille,[65][66] while the G2 has five LIDARs and has the same styling as the regular production Bolt.[67]: 7  A fleet of 130 G2 Cruise AVs were completed by June 2017, with an expanded, better-integrated sensor suite.[63] The G2 (and G3) Cruise AVs are equipped with five roof-mounted LIDARs, 16 cameras, and 21 radars (both long- and short-range as well as articulating).[67]: 7  The first G1 Cruise AV was retired and sent to the Henry Ford Museum in March 2019.[64]
- A prototype 3rd-generation (G3) Cruise AV was shown in September 2017; Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt stated the G3 AV was designed to incorporate redundant systems and was ready to be scaled up for mass production at the Orion Township factory.[68] In addition, the G3 AV uses fault-tolerant electrical, communication, and actuation systems unique to the automated vehicle and not shared with the Bolt EV.[66][67]: 11  With the completion of 50 G3 Cruise AVs in fall 2017, GM now considers the vehicle a separate model from the Bolt.[69] Externally, the G3 Cruise AV may be distinguished from the G2 by the color of the rooftop sensor package (black on the G2, white on the G3) and the two articulating radars: on the G2, these are black and replace the side rear-view mirrors on the G2; on the G3, these are white and are mounted just above the front wheels.[67]: 4, 13
- Members of the press were invited to ride in a G2 Cruise AV in November 2017; they reported the choices made by the car's programming were conservative, but the self-driving system had minimal disengagements over the short 2.4 to 3 mi (3.9 to 4.8 km) trips.[70][71] In January 2018, Cruise showed renderings and a prototype of its planned 4th-generation (G4) AV, which removed the traditional driver's controls such as the steering wheel and pedals[72] and largely retained the external features of the G2,[73] but further development of the G4 Cruise AV was canceled to concentrate on their next generation autonomous vehicle, the Origin, which was unveiled in January 2020 and lacks driver controls entirely.[74] The Origin is scheduled to be introduced in January 2023.[75] Cruise received approval to test cars without safety drivers on public roads in October 2020;[76] the first SAE Level 4 vehicles tested by Cruise were G3 AVs.[77] The safety driver was relegated to the passenger's (right-hand) front seat and did not have access to the traditional controls.[78]
- Later in 2021, a G2 Cruise AV nicknamed "Poppy" was filmed for a short promotional video while undergoing testing in San Francisco.[79] The California Public Utilities Commission approved Cruise's application in June 2022; with the permit, Cruise plans to start offering driverless revenue taxi services in San Francisco with Cruise AVs.[80]
- For the 2022 model year, the Bolt received a significant redesign to its front clip and its rear end, along with some parts of its interior. The front end carries new headlights, along with a new faux-grille and trim. The tail lights and the tailgate hatch also differ slightly from the previous model. For the interior, the shifter has been replaced with gear shifter buttons and the seats have been redesigned along with some of the interior detailing. Dimensions of the vehicle remain unchanged.[81]
- GM also added the completely separate Bolt EUV model to its electric vehicle lineup that year, which has an expanded wheelbase along with some enhanced key features.[82]
- The Bolt's battery uses "nickel-rich lithium-ion" chemistry, allowing the cells to run at higher temperatures than those in GM's previous electric vehicles, allowing a simpler[83] and cheaper[83] liquid cooling system for the 60 kWh (220 MJ) battery pack. The battery pack is a stressed member and weighs 960 lb (440 kg).[84] It accounts for 23% of the car's value,[57] and is composed of 288 flat "landscape" format cells. Cells are bundled into groups of three connected in parallel, and 96 groups connected in series compose the pack, which is rated at 160 kW peak power.[85] GM offers a battery warranty of 8 years / 100,000 miles (160,000 km), and has no plans for other battery sizes.[24]
- In October 2015, General Motors said they will purchase the Bolt's battery cells at a price of $145 per kilowatt hour from LG Chem, representing a minimum of $8,700 in revenue per car.[86] The cost is reportedly about $100 cheaper per kWh than the price LG was giving other customers at the time.[87][88] GM estimated a cell price of $130/kWh in December 2016.[24]
- While initially expected to share its lithium-ion battery technology with the second generation Chevrolet Volt,[17][89] the production version of the Bolt uses batteries with a different chemistry more suited to the different charge cycles of a long-range electric vehicle, compared to the more frequent charging/discharging of hybrids and short-range EVs.[90]
- The 2020 model year's battery capacity increased to 66 kWh because of a small change made to the battery chemistry that increased the EPA rated range by 21 miles (34 km).[5] Physically, the battery is 50.2 in (1,280 mm) wide, 71.1 in (1,810 mm) long, and 7.3 to 13.7 in (190 to 350 mm) high, weighing 947 lb (430 kg).[91]
- Other specifications include a 200 hp (149 kW) and 266 lb⋅ft (361 N⋅m) Interior Permanent Magnet electric motor, acceleration from 0–30 mph (0–48 km/h) in 2.9 seconds and 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in less than 7 seconds, and a top speed of 91 mph (146 km/h). The electric motor is integrated with a single-speed transmission and differential, to form a single modular drive unit that connects directly to the front axles. The single-speed transmission has a final drive ratio of 7.05:1.[92][93][94][95]
- The Bolt EV is tall hatchback design, with a curb weight of 3,580 pounds (1,620 kg).[96]  Despite its overall height of nearly 63 inches (1.6 meters), the center of gravity is under 21 inches (53 cm) above the ground, yielding surprisingly stable handling during cornering. The low center of gravity is due to under-floor mounting of the battery pack.
- Bolt uses the now-common kammback/hatchback low-drag body design, with sweeping curves leading to an abrupt back end. It was initially reported to have a drag coefficient of Cd=0.32[50] but GM says the final production vehicle has Cd=0.308.[97]
- Under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) five-cycle test methodology, the Bolt fuel economy is rated at 119 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpg-e) (17.6 kWh/100 km) for combined driving, 128 mpg‑e (16.4 kWh/100 km) in city and 110 mpg‑e (19 kWh/100 km) in highway.[3][98]
- The Bolt EV has a combined EPA-rated range of 238 miles (383 km).[3] For city driving, the EPA rated the Bolt range at 255 miles (410 km), and due to its relatively high drag coefficient, its range for highway driving is 217 miles (349 km).[99]  One Bolt owner was able to drive from McHenry, Maryland in the western part of the state to Ocean City, Maryland, a distance of 313 miles (504 km), on a single charge.[100]
- The Ampera-e has a certified range of 320 miles (520 km) under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test cycle with a full battery, and achieved a range of 240 miles (380 km) under the more strict Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedures (WLTP).[4] Opel expected the Ampera-e to achieve a NEDC range of about 500 km (310 mi).[101]
- Before the Tesla Model 3 was introduced in July 2017, the Bolt was the only plug-in electric car with a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of less than US$50,000 capable of delivering an EPA-rated range of over 200 miles (320 km).[102]
- As of the 2020 model year, the Bolt has an EPA all-electric range of 259 miles (417 km),[103][5] up from 238 miles (383 km) for the 2017–2019 model years, and EPA fuel economy rating of 119 mpg‑e (17.6 kWh/100 km) for combined city/highway driving.[3]
- All models of Bolt support standard SAE EV charging plugs, at Level 1 or Level 2 (AC). A factory option supports Level 3 (rapid DC) charging with the SAE Combo DC system. A portable Level 1 charging adapter is supplied with each Bolt, stowed in a special compartment under the hatchback floor. It is UL Listed to operate at 120 VAC in the US market but is capable of operating at 240 VAC.[104]
- Level 1 (110 VAC) charging supplies roughly 1 kW[58] and adds 3–5 miles (4.8–8.0 km) of range per hour of charging. Level 2 (240 VAC) charging supplies up to 7.2 kW[58] and adds 20–30 miles (32–48 km) of range per hour of charging. Level 3 charging with the factory-option 55 kW SAE Combo DC fast charging system[105] can add 150 miles (240 km) of range per hour. The Bolt user manual suggests fast-charging to only 80% charge to ensure consistent 50 kW charging.[29][106] The fast charge rate steps down to 38 kW at 56% charge and again to 24 kW at 68% charge. Above 85%, the charge rate varies from 16 kW to 0 kW.[107]
- The Bolt EV is delivered with self-sealing tires whose interior surfaces are coated with a sticky compound to automatically seal small leaks and punctures in the tread area.[108] There is no spare tire, nor is there a built-in place to store one.[109] The car is equipped with a digital Tire Pressure Monitoring System to warn the driver if a tire is leaking, and a portable air compressor kit is supplied as an optional part.[110]  Under the rear hatchback cargo deck, there is a space that can be used to store an undersized spare, and some owners carry a compatible Chevrolet Cruze spare tire there.[111]
- The EPA-rated range of 238 miles (383 km) was confirmed by automotive reporters driving a preproduction Bolt with a 60-kWh battery. Driven under different driving modes with the air conditioning on, the trip between Monterey and Santa Barbara was completed with an energy consumption of 50.1 kWh, representing an average efficiency of 21.1 kWh/100 mi (160 mpg‑e; 13.1 kWh/100 km). A total of 237.8 miles (382.7 km) were driven, with the Bolt's display showing 34 miles (55 km) of range remaining.[112] Several other journalists conducted a preproduction Bolt test drive on the same route, and all reported similar results regarding the Bolt EPA-estimated range.[113][114][115][116][117]
- As part of its debut at the 2016 Paris Motor Show, Opel reported driving an Ampera-e without recharging from Piccadilly Circus in London to Porte de Versailles in Paris, the venue of the exhibition. The rebadged Bolt traveled 259 miles (417 km) with 50 miles (80 km) of range remaining.[101][118]
- Pre-production versions of the Bolt EV were built in March 2016 and sent to Cruise Automation, which modified them as test vehicles for autonomous driving.[121] The modified pre-production vehicles were photographed in San Francisco in May.[65]
- Ordering began in California and Oregon in mid-October 2016.[122] Production for the model year 2017 began in November 2016.[123][36] The first three Bolts were delivered in the San Francisco Bay Area on December 13, 2016,[7] and a total of 579 units were delivered in 2016.[124] Availability was rolled out gradually across the United States, and by August 2017 the car was available nationwide.[7]
- Demand profile did not exactly match predictions, leading GM to slow production in July 2017.[125]  However, in the last months of 2017 Bolt demand rose rapidly; by October, it outsold any other model of electric car, including those from Tesla.[126] Sales totaled 23,297 units in 2017, making the Bolt the U.S. second best selling plug-in car in 2017 after the Tesla Model S (≈26,500).[124][127] In California, the Bolt listed as the top selling plug-in car with 13,487 units delivered, ahead of the much more expensive Tesla Model S, listed second with 11,813.[128] The Bolt also led the state's subcompact segment in 2017, with a market share of 14.7% of all new cars sold in this category.[129] As of February 2018[update], cumulative sales in the American market totaled 26,477 units.[124]
- In January 2019, GM reported that 2018 US sales for the Bolt totaled 18,019, down 22% from the previous year. (US sales of the Tesla Model 3, on the other hand, jumped from 1,764 in 2017 to 139,782 in 2018.[130]) The combined sales of the Bolt and Volt also triggered the start of the full $7,500 tax credit phase out in Q4 2018, prompting the tax credit to reduce to $3,750 in April 2019 and $1,875 in October 2019 before disappearing entirely April 2020.[131]
- The Bolt has been available in Canada since the beginning of 2017. A total of 4,025 Bolt EVs were sold in Canada in 2020.[124]
- In South Korea, General Motors opened the order books on March 18, 2017, and all 400 units of the first allotment were sold out in 2 hours.[132]
- The European version began production in February 2017.[20][133]
- The Ampera-e launch in the Norwegian market was scheduled for April 2017, when 13 were registered.[134][135] Deliveries to retail customers[29] began on May 17, 2017.[136] Over 4,000 cars were ordered in Norway, with some to be delivered in 2018.[133] Registrations totaled 1,121 units in 2017.[137]

- The Ampera-e was first offered for sale in Norway, the first country in Europe where it was marketed, at a starting price of 299 900 kr (€33 500) in December 2016, higher than that of the Nissan Leaf and BMW i3. Availability was limited, as the Ampera-e and Bolt both were assembled at the same Orion Township factory.[138] Three months later in March 2017, Groupe PSA agreed to acquire Opel, the English twin sister brand Vauxhall and the European auto lending business from General Motors as GM exited the European market;[139] the acquisition was completed in November.[140]
- By October 2017, European sales had expanded into Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Germany; there were 4,000-5,000 orders for the Ampera-e in Norway alone, which has a population of 5.2 million.[141] However, dealers in Europe were asked to completely stop accepting orders for the Opel Ampera-e at the same time, as the entire annual allotment for Europe had been sold and the earliest possible delivery date was pushed to 2019.[142][143] The starting price was raised to €46 699 in November.[144] The fact that Opel was limiting orders of the Ampera-e in Norway, its most promising market, led to speculation that GM was planning to discontinue the model in Europe.[145] GM previously has been accused of purposefully sabotaging its EV1 programme,[146] most notably in the 2006 documentary film Who Killed the Electric Car?.[147]
- In February 2018, it was reported that 1,971 Opel Ampera-e had been sold in Europe to date.[148] Deliveries in Norway trickled at fewer than 100 units per month in 2018.[149] For comparison, in 2018, the Hyundai Kona Electric, equipped with a 64 kWh battery and offering comparable range to the Ampera-e, was offered for sale in Norway. The entire yearly allotment, 2,500 vehicles, was sold out almost instantly.[150]
- In 2018, it was virtually impossible to order the car in Europe[citation needed] although in November 2018, it was reported to be on sale in the Netherlands for €46 699, possibly as a way to reduce overall emissions of the cars sold by Opel/Vauxhall.[151] Sales records show that, as of February 2019, fewer than 5,000 Ampera-e vehicles were ever delivered in the entirety of Europe.[152] Even though the Ampera-e could be ordered and bought in the Netherlands in 2019, its steep price was still an issue. In early 2020, the importer lowered the price to €34,149,[153] which brought it closer to the official American MSRP, but still remained thousands of USD more than Americans were actually paying for the car.[154] This was enough to put the car in the top 10 of bestselling cars in the country (regardless of the powertrain), and make it #1 among electric cars.[155][156][157] However, the 2020 price reduction was an incentive to sell the remaining stock;[153] as of 2020, Opel refuses to import any more Bolt/Ampera-e into the Netherlands and Germany.
- Opel/Vauxhall offered the Opel Crossland X, a gasoline- or diesel-powered crossover utility vehicle with styling mildly reminiscent of the Bolt, using a platform developed by Groupe PSA under a partnership with GM predating the acquisition.[158] Under PSA, Opel/Vauxhall announced plans to offer EVs based on the Opel Corsa and the Peugeot 208, both being smaller cars than the Bolt.[144][159] The Corsa-e went on sale in March 2020.[160]
- The Bolt won the 2017 Motor Trend Car of the Year award,[161] the 2017 North American Car of the Year,[9][162] the 2017 AutoGuide.com Reader's Choice Green Car of the Year,[163] 2017 Popular Mechanics Automotive Excellence Awards Car of the Year[164] and the Green Car Reports Best Car To Buy 2017.[165]
The Bolt also ended up Car & Driver's '10 Best Cars' list for 2017.[166] The Chevy Bolt also won the 2017 Green Car of the Year awarded by the Green Car Journal.[167] It was also named by Time among its list of 25 Best Inventions of 2016,[168] and among Popular Science's 10 Greatest Automotive Innovations of 2016.[169] The Bolt EV beat out the Cadillac CT6 and Jaguar XE to win the Detroit Free Press award for Car of the Year.[170] Automobile included the Bolt in its 2017 All Star list.[171]
- In 2015, Chevrolet acknowledged confusion between two vehicles with a similar-sounding names; Bolt and Volt.[172]
- Chevrolet's marketing chief, Tim Mahoney, subsequently announced GM would keep the Bolt name.[173]
- Autoblog projected similar confusion among European customers where the Opel Ampera-e (the Bolt variant) is just one letter off from the Opel Ampera, the previous-generation Chevrolet Volt sold in Europe – suggesting the names could confuse customers who think the new all-electric hatchback is closely related to the old plug-in hybrid hatchback.[174]
- Tata Motors has had a car named the Bolt on the market since 2014, and has registered the trademark in India and other countries.[175]

- General Motors is in a race to be the first company to mass produce self-driving cars, but a recent crash with a San Francisco motorcyclist has illustrated the tricky challenge of assigning blame when an autonomous vehicle gets in an accident.
- As self-driving cars take to the roads in increasing numbers, collisions with standard vehicles are inevitable, experts say, as are lawsuits.
- San Francisco commercial photographer Oscar Nilsson sued GM on Monday, after a Dec. 7 collision with a Chevrolet Bolt that aborted a lane change while driving autonomously.
- The crash highlights an important issue raised by autonomous technology: Self-driving vehicles may not behave like those driven by humans, and that may complicate investigations into who’s at fault.
- “That’s going to continue to be a huge area where we’re going to have problems,” said John Simpson, spokesman for nonprofit Consumer Watchdog, a frequent critic of speedy deployment of autonomous vehicles.
- GM’s subsidiary, Cruise, has since August been testing a self-driving car service in San Francisco with human back-up drivers behind the wheel, as required by the state.
- Nilsson’s lawsuit claims he was riding behind one of GM’s autonomous Bolts on Oak Street, when the car, with its back-up driver, changed lanes to the left. When he rode forward, the Bolt suddenly veered back into his lane and knocked him to the ground, according to the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.
- The San Francisco Police Department’s report on the incident blamed Nilsson for passing a vehicle on the right when it wasn’t safe, but Nilsson’s lawyer Sergei Lemberg disputed that finding.
- “I don’t know what a police officer can tell, after the fact,” Lemberg said Tuesday. “I don’t know that it’s fair to blame this act on the completely innocent person who’s just driving down the road and gets hit.”
- The police report, said Lemberg, actually supported holding GM responsible. It noted that after the Bolt determined it couldn’t make the lane change, and began moving back while Nilsson was passing on the right, the Bolt’s backup driver tried to grab the wheel and steer away, but the collision occurred simultaneously.
- “Why don’t these folks just take some responsibility?” Lemberg said.
- A crash report filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles by GM provided a much different view of the accident. The company acknowledged that the car, in autonomous-driving mode in heavy traffic, had aborted a lane change. But GM said that as its car was “re-centering itself” in the lane, Nilsson, who had been riding between two lanes in a legal-in-California practice known as lane-splitting, “moved into the center lane, glanced the side of the Cruise … wobbled, and fell over.”
- In an emailed statement Tuesday, GM noted that the police report concluded Nilsson was responsible for the accident.
- “Safety is our primary focus when it comes to developing and testing our self-driving technology,” GM said.
- The firm has been running a “Cruise Anywhere” program since August for employees, which allows them to hail automated Cruise vehicles and be driven anywhere in San Francisco. It was unclear whether the vehicle involved in the accident was part of this program.
- It was also unclear if the Bolt in question was one of the “third-generation” automated vehicles described last fall by Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt as “the world’s first mass-producible car designed to operate without a driver.” Those vehicles were intended to be used in the “Cruise Anywhere” program, Vogt wrote in a Medium post.
- Companies operating autonomous vehicles are likely to settle quickly in crash-related lawsuits when the technology appears to be at fault, and fight mightily when they believe the driver of the ordinary vehicle to be responsible, said Stanford researcher and University of South Carolina School of Law professor Bryant Walker Smith.
- “There might be data that might tend to show fault or no fault,” Smith said.
- Such data — which may include video and other driving information from the autonomous vehicle — could aid investigators. Simpson of Consumer Watchdog said it should be publicly disclosed whenever a self-driving car crashes.
- GM’s testing in San Francisco highlights the firm’s progress in the race to mass produce self-driving cars. While Google took an early lead in autonomous driving with a program now spun off into its own company, called Waymo, GM’s manufacturing capabilities and other advantages have allowed it to catch up, according to a report by market-research firm Navigant Research in January.
- Autonomous-vehicle firms competing for success in a new market are bound to face legal thickets when accidents happen.
- In the San Francisco accident, GM’s crash report said the Bolt was traveling at 12 mph, while Nilsson had been driving at 17 mph. After the collision, Nilsson “got up and walked his vehicle to the side of the road” and “reported shoulder pain and was taken to receive medical care.”
- Nilsson claimed in his lawsuit that he suffered neck and shoulder injuries, which will require “lengthy treatment,” and that he had to go on disability leave. He’s seeking unspecified damages.

In California, autonomous vehicle test drivers must have good driving records and successfully complete a test-driver training program administered by the carmaker, DMV spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez said.
- Self-driving test cars could turn up almost anywhere on California’s roads.
- “Companies with permits are allowed to test on any California public roadway — they don’t tell us which ones they are testing on,” Gonzalez said.
- General Motors and its Cruise subsidiary have had a permit to test autonomous vehicles on California roads since June 2015, and have 110 vehicles and 300 test drivers approved for testing, according to the DMV.

- Two vehicles reportedly engaged in self-drive modes - a Tesla Model S and a General Motors Chevy Bolt - have been involved in separate road accidents in California.
- Culver City's fire service said the Tesla had "ploughed into the rear" of one of its fire engines parked at the scene of an accident on Monday.
- The car's owner subsequently claimed it had been in Autopilot mode at the time.
- The GM incident resulted in a collision with a motorbike in San Francisco.
- The rider says the car - which was using GM's Cruise Automation technology - caused him serious injury and is now suing GM, according to local newspaper The Mercury News.
- GM has alleged the motorcyclist was at fault. The event dates back to December, but has come to light only now.
- Car-makers suggest self-drive technologies should make the roads safer, but at present California requires a driver to remain behind the wheel so they can retake control at short notice.
- However, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles is currently considering new regulations that would allow tests on public roads without a human sitting in the driver's seat.
- The US National Transportation Board (NTSB) has said it will investigate the Tesla crash.
- According to a tweet by the Culver City Firefighters, the Model S was travelling at 65mph (105km/h) when the impact occurred.
- "Amazingly, there were no injuries," an official said.
- Tesla has the ability to analyse data gathered by its vehicles' on-board computers to determine the cause of crashes, and has shared information with the press about previous high-profile accidents.
- However, for now the car company has limited itself to saying that "Autopilot is intended for use only with a fully attentive driver" and that it has instructed drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel while employing it.
- The NTSB previously investigated Tesla after a Model S crash in 2016 in which the driver died.
- It held the company partly accountable saying the Autopilot system had given the victim "leeway... to divert his attention to something other than driving".
- Since the accident, Tesla has introduced an update that brings its cars to a halt if they detect a driver's hands are not on the wheel.
- The Chevy Bolt accident was on 7 December during the morning commute.
- The injured motorcyclist, Oscar Nilsson, is a commercial photographer who had previously worked with GM and other car brands on commercial projects.
- According to an accident report filed by GM, its vehicle had been changing lanes when the gap ahead closed.
- While the Chevy Bolt had been re-centring itself in the original lane, GM said, a Honda motorcycle travelling at a faster speed had moved into the car's way, glanced off its side, wobbled and fallen over.
- "Safety is our primary focus when it comes to developing and testing our self-driving technology," a GM spokesman told the BBC.
- "In this matter, the SFPD [San Francisco Police Department] collision report stated that the motorcyclist merged into our lane before it was safe to do so."
- However, Mr Nilsson disputes this account and alleges the car "suddenly veered" into his lane.
- His lawyer has further alleged the Chevy's back-up driver had tried to grab the wheel to prevent the accident but was too late to do so.
- "Why don't these folks take some responsibility?" the lawyer told the Mercury News.
- Mr Nilsson claims he has suffered neck and shoulder injuries, adding he has had to take sick leave, and is claiming damages.
- Details of the legal dispute have emerged a week after GM published its annual self-driving safety report.
- It also announced that it hoped to deploy test vehicles with no steering wheel or pedals as soon as next year.

- Two recent crashes raise questions over the readiness of self-driving technology
- &#151; -- A San Francisco man is suing General Motors after a collision between his motorcycle and a self-driving Chevrolet Bolt.
- Oscar Nilsson claims in his lawsuit that he was driving behind a Bolt in San Francisco in December when the car began to change lanes. As Nilsson attempted to pass the Bolt, the self-driving vehicle "suddenly veered back into Mr. Nilsson's lane," knocking him to the ground, the lawsuit alleges.
- Nilsson claims in his suit that he suffered injuries to his neck and shoulder, forcing him to take time off work.
- General Motors has a different version of events leading up to the crash.
- The company says in a statement to ABC News that the motorcyclist merged prematurely into the Bolt's lane.
- "Safety is our primary focus when it comes to developing and testing our self-driving technology. In this matter, the SFPD collision report stated that the motorcyclist merged into our lane before it was safe to do so,” GM said in its statement.
- The San Francisco Police Department crash report did not assign blame for the collision, and no citations were issued at the crash scene.
- The news of the lawsuit comes as a federal investigation has been launched into more recent crash, on Jan. 22, involving a Tesla and a fire truck in Southern California.
- In that incident, a Tesla Model S struck the rear of a Culver City fire truck that was parked on the side of a freeway in West Los Angeles while first responders tended to a victim of an unrelated traffic collision, according to a collision report from the California Highway Patrol.
- The driver of the Tesla Model S said the "autopilot" feature of his car was engaged prior to the collision, according to the highway patrol report. No one was injured in the crash.
- The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.
- ABC News reached out to Tesla for comment but has not heard back.
- But speaking in general and not in regard to this particular crash, Tesla and independent experts both say that a driver using the current autonomous technology needs to remain ready to take over control of the vehicle at any time.
- "Some of the cars say they have autopilot; that does not mean that the driver can check out," National Safety Council President and CEO Debbie Hersman told ABC News.
- Hersman is also a former board member of the NTSB.
- Elon Musk, co-founder and CEO of Tesla, has echoed that statement, previously telling ABC News, "The responsibility remains with the driver."

- Motorcyclist Oscar Nilsson might not have been going fast when he and an autonomous Chevrolet Bolt EV collided, but he was quick to point the finger and assign fault to the prototype vehicle. A General Motors spokesperson indicated that, based on the police report, the automaker does not believe its vehicle was to blame. Now Nilsson is suing GM.
- The accident happened in San Francisco, where GM has been testing vehicles equipped with self-driving technology developed by its Cruise Automation division. Unlike the Las Vegas autonomous-shuttle crash in November, during which a truck backed into a stationary self-driving bus, both Nilsson and the Bolt EV were in motion when this accident occurred.
- The accounts of the event, which occurred on December 7, are a point of contention in the lawsuit. According to the accident report filed by GM, the Bolt EV was driving in the center of a three-lane street in front of Nilsson on his 1996 Honda S90 motorcycle. The car attempted to change into the left lane, but when it sensed the gap was too small, it corrected back into the center lane. There is no indication of how turn signals were or weren’t used. At the same time, Nilsson, who had been lane-splitting the center and right lanes, accelerated into the center lane. The Bolt, at 12 mph, bumped Nilsson, going 17 mph, and Nilsson fell off his motorcycle. One of Cruise Automation’s human Autonomous Vehicle Trainers was in the front seat when the events unfolded, but, as the GM spokesman told C/D in an emailed statement, “the San Francisco Police Department report stated that the motorcyclist merged into our lane before it was safe to do so.”
- The lawsuit alleges, however, that “The self-driving vehicle suddenly veered back into Mr. Nilsson’s lane, striking Mr. Nilsson and knocking him to the ground.” Nilsson is claiming his neck and shoulder were injured during the accident and will need “lengthy treatment” that have “forced” him to take a leave of absence from work. The lawsuit is seeking more than $75,000.
- The autonomous Bolt EVs that GM has been deploying for testing are reliant on cameras, sensors, radar, and computing power that could lend information to the incident, but it is unclear if or how that information could be used in such a lawsuit. With more and more companies launching testing for self-driving vehicles, this type of accident and determining who is at fault will be a hot topic—one that will rely on both humans and computers to sort out.

- By  Zac Estrada
- A motorcyclist involved in a crash last month in San Francisco with a Cruise Automation self-driving vehicle filed suit against that company’s parent and maker of the vehicle, General Motors.
- Oscar Nilsson’s suit over the Dec. 7, 2017 crash, The Mercury News reported Tuesday, claims he was injured while riding behind a Cruise Automation Chevrolet Bolt that had someone in the driver’s seat, but who did not have their hands on the steering wheel. When the car started to change into a left lane, it abruptly returned to the initial lane and collided with Nilsson, who now says the crash resulted in injuries that have forced him to take disability leave from work, according to The Mercury News.
- But details of the crash in a report filed by GM to the California Department of Motor Vehicles contradicts Nilsson’s claim. The automaker reported the Bolt, operating in autonomous mode in heavy traffic, stopped a requested lane change from the center lane to the left lane because a vehicle decelerated and the gap was deemed too small than initially thought. While the Bolt was trying to center itself in the initial lane again when Nilsson, “wobbled and fell over,” while trying to lane split. The damage to the Bolt was a, “long scuff on passenger side of the vehicle,” according to the DMV report.
- ‘In this case the motorcyclist merged into our lane before it was safe to do so.’
- “At Cruise, we test our self-driving cars in challenging and unpredictable environments precisely because by doing so we will get better, safer AV technology on the roads sooner,” a spokesperson from the automaker wrote in an email to The Verge. “In this case the motorcyclist merged into our lane before it was safe to do so.”
- GM reported the Bolt was traveling at 12 mph at the time of the collision, while Nilsson was going faster than the flow of traffic at approximately 17 mph. The report also states Nilsson got up and moved his Honda motorcycle to the side of the street to exchange information with the vehicle operator, complained of shoulder pain and was taken to get medical care.
- News of the suit comes just days after GM said it would release a Level 5 autonomous vehicle – without a steering wheel or pedals – in 2019. In November, the automaker said it would also launch a self-driving rideshare service, also in 2019. Even before Nilsson’s crash, the Cruise vehicles had been in 13 crashes that were reported to the California DMV, Reuters reported in October.

- This article was published more than 5 years ago
- A California motorcyclist has filed a lawsuit against General Motors, accusing one of the manufacturer’s robot-operated vehicles of “negligent driving.”
- Oscar Willhelm Nilsson claims he was traveling down a San Francisco street last month when a Cruise AV aborted a lane change and swerved into his lane. The car struck him, “knocking him to the ground,” in a crash that left him injured and unable to work, according to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco this week.
- The Cruise AV was operating in self-driving mode at the time of the crash, the suit alleges, but a backup driver was sitting in the front seat of the vehicle with his hands off the wheel.
- A San Francisco Police Department report, however, puts the blame on Nilsson. According to the report, Nilsson tried to pass a vehicle before it was safe.
- Nilsson’s suit is one of the first involving an autonomous vehicle. Though manufacturers say self-driving vehicles will dramatically reduce traffic accidents and motor vehicle fatalities, experts are already warning that there will probably be many more accidents involving robot-operated cars, a type of accident that raises unresolved questions about responsibility and restitution.
- A Tesla owner’s excuse for his DUI: The car was driving
- As of last week, the California Department of Motor Vehicles alone lists 54 autonomous vehicle accident reports dating to 2014, most of them minor accidents in which other drivers were at fault. Two Teslas were involved in separate crashes in California last week. Both drivers claimed that the vehicles were on autopilot, a feature that gives the vehicles semi-autonomy but still requires the driver to be responsible for the car.
- A Model S driver who appeared to have ignored numerous warnings inside his Tesla, according to a federal report, was killed in an accident in 2016. The National Transportation Safety Board report said the driver was overly reliant on the vehicle’s autopilot before his fatal crash.
- But in future wrecks involving automated vehicles, experts say, manufacturers could see their liability increase.
- “When crashes occur it’s much less likely that there’ll be a human to blame in a lot of instances and it’ll be much more likely that it can be argued that the automated system can do better,” said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and an expert on the law of self-driving cars.
- Smith said investigators will likely determine fault by asking how humans would have performed in a similar circumstance and whether how comparable the automated system performed around the same time.
- “Data will be crucial to these cases,” Smith added. “Investigations will increasingly turn on digital data stored locally or remotely — from the vehicles involved, other vehicles, personal devices, and surrounding infrastructure. Sometimes these data will provide certainty [allowing investigators to “replay” a crash] and sometimes they will actually introduce new uncertainty.”
- In a report filed with the California DMV, GM disputed Nilsson’s account of the crash.
- “As the Cruise AV was re-centering itself in the lane, a motorcycle that had just lane-split between two vehicles in the center and right lanes moved into the center lane, glanced the side of the Cruise AV, wobbled and fell over,” the report claims, noting that the Cruise AV was traveling with the flow of traffic at 12 mph and the motorcycle was traveling at approximately 17 mph.
- The report states that crash resulted in a “long scuff on passenger side of the vehicle.”
- “The motorcyclist was determined to be at fault for attempting to overtake and pass another vehicle on the right under conditions that did not permit that movement in safety,” the report says, adding that Nilsson claimed he had shoulder pain.
- Reached by email, a GM spokesperson said safety is the company’s “primary focus” during the development and testing of self-driving technology.
- “In this matter,” the spokesperson added, “the SFPD collision report stated that the motorcyclist merged into our lane before it was safe to do so.”
- GM’s latest car gives up steering wheels, pedals — and human control
- The suit arrives on the heels of GM’s announcement that the company has submitted a petition to the Department of Transportation this month asking for permission to deploy self-driving Cruise AV’s. A fourth-generation autonomous vehicle based on the Chevy Bolt EV, the vehicles lack a steering wheel, pedals and human backup drivers.
- The manufacturer is touting the vehicle as the world’s “first production-ready vehicle” built with the sole purpose of operating “safely on its own with no driver.”
- GM — already testing driverless vehicles in San Francisco and Phoenix — is one of several companies testing level 4 vehicles — those that are autonomous to a degree. A California-based autonomous vehicle start-up called Zoox and Alphabet’s Waymo have also tested level 4 cars.
- Nilsson’s suit seeks unspecified damages, as well as the cost of attorney’s fees and punitive damages. Reached by email, Nilsson’s lawyer, Sergei Lemberg, claims that the police report actually supports his client’s claim, not GM’s.
- He said the police report states that the AV driver saw Nilsson before the crash but didn’t have enough time to grab the wheel and swerve.
- “Absolutely we dispute it,” he said, referring to GM’s side of the story. “As far as the technology is concerned, I’m troubled that GM shifted the blame to my client. The maneuver by the autonomous car was unpredictable and dangerous.”

- Oscar Nilsson ‘knocked to ground’ in San Francisco as company tested self-driving cars
- General Motors is facing one of the first lawsuits to involve an autonomous vehicle, after a collision between its Cruise self-driving car and a motorbike in California.
- Motorcyclist Oscar Nilsson is suing GM stating that the Chevrolet Bolt, which was operating in autonomous mode with a backup driver behind the wheel, “suddenly veered back into Nilsson’s lane, striking Nilsson and knocking him to the ground”.
- The accident happened on 7 December in heavy traffic in the Hayes Valley district of San Francisco, with the GM vehicle reportedly travelling at 12mph and the motorcycle 17mph. The accident report filed with the California disputes Nilsson’s claims.
- The report states that the autonomous vehicle was driving in the centre of three one-way lanes. It attempted to move into the left lane when the available space was truncated by braking traffic, causing the GM car to abort its move and return to the centre of the middle lane.
- “As the Cruise AV was re-centring itself in the lane, a motorcycle that that had just lane-split between two vehicles in the centre and right lanes moved into the centre lane, glanced the side of the Cruise AV, wobbled and fell over,” says the report. “The motorcyclist was determined to be at fault for attempting to overtake and pass another vehicle on the right under conditions that did not permit that movement in safety.”
- Nilsson was able to walk his motorbike to the side of the road before exchanging information with the GM car’s occupants and receiving medical care for shoulder pain.
- Nilsson’s lawyer Sergei Lemberg disputed the report. He told Mercury News: “I don’t know what a police officer can tell, after the fact.
- “I don’t know that it’s fair to blame this act on the completely innocent person who’s just driving down the road and gets hit.”
- GM said that it intentionally tests its self-driving vehicles in challenging conditions. A GM spokesperson told Jalopnik: “Safety is our primary focus when it comes to developing and testing our self-driving technology. In this matter, the San Francisco Police Department collision report determined that the motorcyclist merged into our lane before it was safe to do so.”
- The company has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco since August, allowing employees to hail the cars with a backup driver behind the wheel. Its cars were involved in six no-fault collisions in September.
- As more self-driving cars take to the streets, lawsuits such as Nilsson’s are inevitable, but it highlights the dilemma of autonomous vehicles: who pays in the case of an accident.
- Testing vehicles are clearly operated by the company developing the technology, in this case GM, but once the vehicles are bought and owned by individuals the picture of who is to blame becomes much more murky. Should the driver, who may or may not be in direct control of the vehicle at the time, have responsibility for all operations of the vehicle?
- It’s likely that the vehicle’s collection of data as part of its operation that could be used to prove fault, but whether the companies operating them will want to set a precedent and give up that data remains to be seen.
- Professor Bryant Walker Smith, from the University of South Carolina’s School of Law, told Mercury News that he expects companies to settle suits quickly if they believe their technology is at fault, but fight fiercely should human operators of other vehicles be at fault.
- GM is not the only traditional automotive manufacturer racing to challenge the likes of Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber with self-driving technology. A collision involving a car from Ford’s autonomous vehicle firm Argo recently sent two people to hospital.

- Two major car manufacturers are under fire after collisions involving their motors while using hi-tech features. So will the new technology really make UK motorways safer?
- DRIVERLESS cars are due to appear on UK roads by 2021, with the promise of making our motorways safer and more efficient.
- Experts have claimed the introduction of self-driving motors will reduce road deaths by removing human error from the equation.
- But as manufacturers ramp up testing in the race to become the first to generate a fool-proof autonomous car, instances of the technology going wrong are starting to raise eyebrows about its safety.
- Back in 2016, Tesla CEO Elon Musk famously stated "the probability of having an accident is 50 per cent lower" using the manufacturer's Autopilot feature compared to full human control, but recent incidents have seen the technology come under fire.
- Following a collision with a Tesla Model S electric car and a fire engine in California on Monday, the driver allegedly told investigators he was using Autopilot at the time.
- The system, which keeps a vehicle centred in its lane at a set distance from cars in front of it and also can change lanes and brake automatically, is now under investigation in the US for the second time.
- Tesla wouldn't say if Autopilot was working at the time of the crash, but said in a statement Monday that drivers must stay attentive when it's in use.
- The Model S Autopilot is "Level 2" on the self-driving scale - where "Level 5" motors can operate autonomously in nearly all circumstances.
- Level 2 automation systems are generally limited to use on interstate highways in the US, but drivers are supposed to continuously monitor vehicle performance and be ready to take control if necessary with these models.
- Monday's collision is not an isolated incident after several other high-profile cases of road accidents involving self-driving cars from different manufacturers in recent years.
- Level 1: The first level of autonomy means the driver remains in control of the car the entire time. Steering and acceleration can be controlled by the car. These systems are already on sale and include self-parking and lane assit
- Level 2: These require drivers to pay attention to their surroundings and be prepared to "take control of the vehicle in specific situations". Drivers have to keep their hands on the wheel just in case, too. Tesla Autopilot currently displays this level.
- Level 3: These cars can make decisions for themselves without the need for driver inputs in certain situations. The Audi A8 can offer this tech - regulation permitting - with the ability to drive itself up to 37mph and goes on sale next year.
- Level 4: These are true "driverless cars" that can navigate without any driver help and can independently indicate, brake and steer. These won't be on sale until 2021 at the earliest.
- Level 5: The end goal is a car that doesn't need a driver at all - there might not even be pedals or a steering wheel. Google is currently developing an example of this with its Waymo project.
- General Motors is currently facing a lawsuit over a San Francisco collision which saw a motorcyclist knocked off his bike by a Chevrolet Bolt performing a lane change while in self-driving mode.
- Oscar Nilsson is suing the motor manufacturer over the December incident, which he claims was the fault of the semi-autonomous technology.
- One of Google's driverless cars was involved in a shunt when it pulled into the path of an oncoming bus back in February 2016.
- Uber was forced to pull their self-driving cars from the road in March last year, too, after a test vehicle ended up on it side while attempting to make a turn.
- Volvo also delayed its DriveMe driverless trials until 2021 over safety fears the tech wasn't ready for public use.
- The first fatal road accident involving a self-driving car occurred in May 2016, when 40-year-old Joshua Brown was killed after his Tesla Model S collided with a truck in Florida.
- Brown was allegedly watching a Harry Potter film while operating his car in the Autopilot mode.
- The US National Transportation Safety Board in September determined that design limitations of the Tesla Model S Autopilot played a major role in a May 2016 fatal crash in Florida involving a vehicle operating under Autopilot - but it blamed the crash on an inattentive Tesla driver's overreliance on technology and a truck driver who made a left turn in front of the car.
- According to a recent investigation, the driver had his hands on the sedan's steering wheel for only 25 seconds out of the 37.5 minutes the vehicle's cruise control and lane-keeping systems were in use prior to the crash.
- Tesla has taken steps to prevent drivers from using Autopilot improperly, including measuring the amount of torque applied to the steering wheel and sending visual and audio warnings.
- If the warnings are ignored, drivers would be prevented from using Autopilot, the company has said.

- General Motors has agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by a motorcyclist who alleged in January that one of the automaker’s self-driving Chevy Bolts knocked him off his bike in a California crash. The settlement for the case, the first known to involve an autonomous car crash, comes as GM moves to quickly accelerate the development of its self-driving technology.
- Oscar Nilsson filed a lawsuit against General Motors Monday concerning a collision between Nilsson…
- The accident dates to early December, when California resident Oscar Nilsson claimed he was riding behind one of GM’s autonomous Bolts when, suddenly, the car veered into his lane and knocked him to the ground. A safety driver was at the wheel of the Bolt during the Dec. 7 crash, according to the complaint, which happened in downtown San Francisco.
- GM acknowledged the aborted lane change in a crash report filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, but didn’t admit fault and offered a different narrative,  claiming Nilsson had been riding between two lanes when he “moved into the center lane, glanced the side of the [car]… wobbled, and fell over.”﻿
- Nevertheless, Nilsson said in the suit that the accident required him to take disability leave for shoulder and neck injuries. His complaint represented the first lawsuit to be filed over a crash involving a self-driving car, at a time when many questions remain unanswered over who should be held liable in a crash.
- But however it would’ve panned out won’t be known. On Wednesday, GM and Nilsson’s attorneys told a federal court the matter had been settle.d
- “The parties anticipate finalizing all details and filing a joint stipulation for dismissal with prejudice within thirty (30) days, or before June 29, 2018,” the filing said.
- Sergei Lemberg, an attorney for Nilsson, told Jalopnik: “The case has been resolved to my client’s satisfaction.” A GM spokesperson confirmed the deal: “The parties have mutually agreed to resolve a lawsuit filed by a motorcyclist following a minor traffic incident in late 2017.”
- The settlement puts aside a possibly thorny legal issue for GM as the automaker moves to speed up the development of its autonomous car technology. The company received a major endorsement Thursday from technology investment firm SoftBank Vision Fund, which announced plans to invest $2.25 billion in GM’s self-driving car division.
- GM kicked off 2018 with the introduction of a driverless Bolt that has no brakes or a steering wheel, and said it wants to deploy the cars for a driverless ride-hailing service by 2019. It’ll have to overcome immense concerns from the general public, which remains skeptical of autonomous vehicles, even more so after recent fatal crashes involving a self-driving Uber and a semi-autonomous Tesla Model X. A week after the deadly Uber crash, one of GM’s Bolts received a ticket in San Francisco for being too close to a pedestrian.

- Motorcyclist Oscar Nilsson might not have been going fast when he and an autonomous Chevrolet Bolt EV collided, but he was quick to point the finger and assign fault to the prototype vehicle. A General Motors spokesperson indicated that, based on the police report, the automaker does not believe its vehicle was to blame. Now Nilsson is suing GM.
- The accident happened in San Francisco, where GM has been testing vehicles equipped with self-driving technology developed by its Cruise Automation division. Unlike the Las Vegas autonomous-shuttle crash in November, during which a truck backed into a stationary self-driving bus, both Nilsson and the Bolt EV were in motion when this accident occurred.
- The accounts of the event, which occurred on December 7, are a point of contention in the lawsuit. According to the accident report filed by GM, the Bolt EV was driving in the center of a three-lane street in front of Nilsson on his 1996 Honda S90 motorcycle. The car attempted to change into the left lane, but when it sensed the gap was too small, it corrected back into the center lane. There is no indication of how turn signals were or weren’t used. At the same time, Nilsson, who had been lane-splitting the center and right lanes, accelerated into the center lane. The Bolt, at 12 mph, bumped Nilsson, going 17 mph, and Nilsson fell off his motorcycle. One of Cruise Automation’s human Autonomous Vehicle Trainers was in the front seat when the events unfolded, but, as the GM spokesman told C/D in an emailed statement, “the San Francisco Police Department report stated that the motorcyclist merged into our lane before it was safe to do so.”
- The lawsuit alleges, however, that “The self-driving vehicle suddenly veered back into Mr. Nilsson’s lane, striking Mr. Nilsson and knocking him to the ground.” Nilsson is claiming his neck and shoulder were injured during the accident and will need “lengthy treatment” that have “forced” him to take a leave of absence from work. The lawsuit is seeking more than $75,000.
- The autonomous Bolt EVs that GM has been deploying for testing are reliant on cameras, sensors, radar, and computing power that could lend information to the incident, but it is unclear if or how that information could be used in such a lawsuit. With more and more companies launching testing for self-driving vehicles, this type of accident and determining who is at fault will be a hot topic—one that will rely on both humans and computers to sort out.
