- A woman attempting to report a violent crime in a Los Angeles park was turned away by 'HP Robocop', a police robot on duty for Huntingdon Park Police Department. Despite Cogo Guebara pushing the robot's its emergency alert button several times, it barked at Guebara to ‘Step out of the way’ and continued to glide along its pre-programmed route instead of offering assistance.
- Media reports said people, especially children, said they felt generally reassured by the robot's presence. But some felt it resembled a form of creeping surveillance whilst others worry that a tendency amongst some to anthropomorphise the objects  highlights the disconnect between people’s expectations of the robot and the reality of its capabilities.
- Knightscope robots combine self-driving technology, robotics and artificial intelligence to create what the company calls 'crime-fighting autonomous data machines.' According to Huntingdon police, leasing the robot for a year costs the city between USD 60,000-70,000, roughly equivalent to the annual salary of a Huntington Park police officer.

- HUNTINGTON PARK, Calif. — When a fight broke out recently in the parking lot of Salt Lake Park, a few miles south of downtown Los Angeles, Cogo Guebara did what seemed the most practical thing at the time: she ran over to the park’s police robot to push its emergency alert button.
- “I was pushing the button but it said, ‘step out of the way,’” Guebara said. “It just kept ringing and ringing, and I kept pushing and pushing.”
- She thought maybe the robot, which stands about 5 feet tall and has “POLICE” emblazoned on its egg-shaped body, wanted a visual of her face, so she crouched down for the camera. It still didn’t work.
- Without a response, Rudy Espericuta, who was with Guebara and her children at the time, dialed 911. About 15 minutes later, after the fight had ended, a woman was rolled out on a stretcher and into an ambulance, her head bleeding from a cut suffered during the altercation.
- Amid the scene, the robot continued to glide along its pre-programmed route, humming an intergalactic tune that could have been ripped from any low-budget sci-fi film. The almost 400-pound robot followed the park’s winding concrete from the basketball courts to the children’s splash zone, pausing every so often to tell visitors to “please keep the park clean.”
- The robot, officially named HP RoboCop, has been patrolling Salt Lake Park for the Huntington Park Police Department since June. NBC News visited the park numerous times to observe its operation and its interactions with people.
- While people are beginning to more commonly encounter robots in everyday life, they can often fall short of expectations — much as HP RoboCop did. That gap can be exploited as a way to make a robot more effective than it actually is, but also runs the risk of creating situations in which people rely on robots in ways they’re unprepared for, as was the case for Guebara.
- The robot’s alert button is not yet connected to the police department, said Cosme Lozano, chief of police of Huntington Park, a city just southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The calls are instead directed to Knightscope, the company that creates and leases the robots.
- “That’s why we’re not advertising those features,” he said. “It’s a new program for us and were still developing some protocols… to be able to fully adopt the program.”
- HP RoboCop is one of more than 70 autonomous security robots developed by Knightscope. The Silicon Valley company says it has combined self-driving technology, robotics and artificial intelligence to create what it calls “crime-fighting autonomous data machines.” The robots are deployed across the U.S., serving everywhere from airports to gas stations.
- Lozano said the department is facing some technical challenges incorporating the robot into the force, adding that it’s on “a trial basis for the city.” Once fully connected, the calls will go directly to the department’s dispatch center, he said.
- HP RoboCop is a K5 model, specialized for outdoor use, and is one of the company’s first to wear a police moniker. Knightscope’s website promotes some of the K5’s abilities as including a 360-degree high-definition live video stream, a license plate reader that can scan 1,200 plates a minute, a two-way intercom and the ability to track cell phone use in the vicinity.
- But as it is currently used, HP RoboCop is little more than a glorified security camera on wheels. The robot’s five cameras provide 24/7 live monitoring, with the ability to send footage directly to officers’ phones, but that’s currently only accessible to Knightscope. It’s another feature that the police are working on activating, Lozano said.
- The robot is confined to the park’s cement path, which has been blocked by construction for a new aquatics center, curtailing its patrol of the north end of the park. Leasing the robot for a year costs the city between $60,000-$70,000, Lozano said. As of 2018, a Huntington Park police officer with a basic assignment makes an annual salary that falls in the same range.
- Other Knightscope robots have not been without tribulations. One K5 robot patrolling around an office complex in Washington, D.C., ended up falling into a fountain. Another of the same model struck a toddler at a shopping mall in Silicon Valley.
- The city’s official adopted name for the machine is HP RoboCop, but everyone in the park seems to have their own nicknames for it. “R2D2,” “Spy Machine,” and “Wall-E’’ are just some of the pet names that highlight the disconnect between people’s expectations of the robot and the reality of its capabilities.
- Concession stand worker Orlando Enrique said he’s noticed a change in people’s behavior since the robot’s arrival. Just its presence seems to offer a sense of reassurance to many.
- “A lot of people like it because they feel secure,” he said. “They can leave their kids.”
- Enrique, 28, lives in Norwalk, California, and has worked at the snack bar for nine years. The store closes at 10:30 p.m. and now with the robot there, he feels more comfortable walking to his car after a shift.
- People come from all over to see it, Enrique said, referring to the mini-tourist boom that HP RoboCop brought to the park. It is especially popular among kids.
- On Labor Day, curious children trailed HP RoboCop as it patrolled. One little boy bumbled behind with a bag of Doritos in tow. He stared at the machine, doe-eyed, before lightly stroking its cylinder body ― until another boy asked, “Why are you petting it like a dog?”
- This anthropomorphizing of the robot is totally normal, said Ross Knepper, an associate professor in the department of computer science at Cornell University.
- There are a lot of unknowns when it comes to these machines, and humans just don’t have the right expectations to draw from, so they refer to “Hollywood magic,” he said. People recall what they’ve seen in movies and transfer those expectations onto the real thing.
- “It’s something the brain automatically tries to do,” said Knepper, who is helping develop robots that can work with humans as peers rather than tools.
- This can lead people to believe that a robot is much more capable and intelligent than it really is and can create a false sense of security, he said.
- Violeta Alvaraz, who was visiting the park with her kids and mother, is from the neighboring township Bell, and learned about HP RoboCop through her son. His generation is more comfortable with that kind of technology, she said, commenting that to her it looked like a 1970s washing machine.
- Though she said she appreciates the city’s investment in their safety, Alvaraz still has plenty of questions.
- “Are we going to get in trouble if we touch it?” she asked. “Who’s guiding it? I don’t know how it works. Should I still call 911?”
- Most people in the park who spoke with NBC News were fond of HP RoboCop, usually attaching a “he” pronoun when speaking about it, but all admitted they did not know its full functionality.
- Despite HP RoboCop’s months-long tenure in the park, there is no signage describing what it does or why it is there. Lozano said that’s because the department does not want to falsely advertise the robot, but the information will be posted when the machine’s features are properly connected, he added.
- Leveraging people’s uncertainty about the robot is core to its value as a security tool, Knepper said.
- The fact that the public is unaware of all of the robot’s capabilities is integral to Knightscope robots’ mission to be a physical deterrent to crime, confirmed Stacey Stephens, the company’s executive vice president and chief client officer.
- “They could have any kind of grand thought about what the robot might be able to do, which could lead them to say, ‘you know what, I’d rather not risk it. Let me go somewhere else,’” Stephens said.
- Crime in the robot’s patrol zone has gone down, Lozano said. Though that’s hard to measure, the police have not had to contact Knightscope to review footage, except for the few times the robot itself was vandalized, he said. HP RoboCop has weathered a few minor personal assaults, including fielding a “wheelie” from a biker who purposefully rode into it. But the only significant damage was when the police first deployed the robot, Lozano said. Officers were able to track down the suspects of what he called the “robot tipping incident,” using HP RoboCop’s own footage.
- Still, the police took the assault personally, said Lozano. The children in the park aren’t the only people who have developed something of an affinity for HP RoboCop. “How could you go mess with our robot?” Lozano said. “You would think the robot was murdered. We kind of jumped on it like we would have a significant crime.”
- Even if they are simple phrases, a robot’s ability to talk can change how people feel about it, Knepper said. As soon as it speaks, people’s expectations are dramatically altered.
- “As researchers, we are very eager to employ all these new technologies, speech and acting in a socially competent way, but if we don’t have this other side of setting expectations of awareness of how people will interpret these behaviors, we run the risk of actually making an interaction with the robot worse and not better,” Knepper said.
- Stephens prefers not to use the name HP RoboCop. He said it gives a false impression of the Knightscope’s mission, which is to gather intelligence for law enforcement.
- “I think what people have in their head when they hear RoboCop is something that is going to shoot everybody up and intervene in a crime and that’s not what this is about,” he said.
- Stephens was referencing the titular RoboCop from a series of movies that began in the late 1980s, offering a futuristic vision of a human-machine crime fighter and an explanation for why expectations about robotics in policing can quickly surpass reality. The character remains a relevant pop culture figure, with a new RoboCop movie released in 2014 and another currently in development.
- But HP RoboCop seems to elicit the opposite reaction ― consistently followed by an entourage of kids high-fiving or holding its can-shaped body like a fifth-grade dance partner. Although a company can’t control how people project their imagination onto robots, said Knepper, it can encourage them to recall certain references through design.
- Despite all of HP RoboCop’s capabilities, both real and perceived, it does not have the capacity to explain itself. The city, however, has an obligation to educate the public about the technology it’s using, Knepper said. This could also help the police achieve their goals of reducing crime.
- “Once people really understand what’s at stake, I think they will modify their behavior in much more predictable ways,” he said.
- CORRECTION (Oct. 11, 2019, 8:15 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misspelled the first name of a visitor to the park. She is Violeta Alvaraz, not Violete.

- When Huntington Park swore in its HP Robocop this summer, it was touted as crime deterrent. But a woman said she tried to use the service when a fight recently broke out and was never able to get in touch with police using the robot.
- HUNTINGTON PARK, Calif. (KABC) -- When Huntington Park swore in its HP Robocop this summer, it was touted as a crime deterrent. But a recent incident has surfaced some of its inabilities.
- That incident involved a fight that broke out at Salt Lake Park. A witness tried pressing an emergency button to summon police, but the Robocop simply told her to "step away."
- Witnesses ended up calling 911 directly. Police admit this was not the best situation, telling Eyewitness News,  "HP Robocop's full capabilities including camera monitoring and 911 connection are currently pending."

- "If they could do it, I mean why not?" said one nearby resident.
- The bilingual HP Robocop says "nice to see you" and other short phrases. While cameras can shoot 360-degree video, it is not storing it.
- Police Chief Cosme Lozano said he is working on enabling those capabilities, possibly in the next two weeks. In the meantime, police said it promotes safety by simply having law enforcement presence, and they remind residents to call 911 directly.

- Picture a world where police robots roam the streets dealing with crime, and I can pretty much guarantee you'll either think of a nightmarish all-powerful police state where everything has gone horribly wrong and/or Robocop.
- But it turns out robot police are already here and it's nothing like either of those options: They just don't really give a shit about citizens.
- For those of you who missed it, earlier this year Huntington Park, California added a new police officer to its squad; a robot actually named RoboCop.
- It even has its own twee social media accounts, and has chatted to Elon Musk.Related StoriesNew York Lawyer Caught Using ChatGPT After Citing Cases That Don't ExistShould We All Be Meditating? Find Out In Issue 11 Of CURIOUS – Out NowGoodbye, WinRAR: Windows Is Finally Adding This Much-Wanted Feature
- At the time of RoboCop's unveiling, the city and police force were optimistic that the robot cop would be a real asset to the force, a hardened cop that stops at nothing to get the job done.
- “HP RoboCop’s capabilities are extremely impressive,” City Manager Ricardo Reyes said in a statement. “In particular its ability to use its microphone to deter criminal activity and its mobility to patrol large open spaces.”
- “The police department is proud to welcome HP RoboCop as an official member of the police force,” Police Chief Cosme Lozano also chipped in. “The extra help will definitely give the officers more time to focus on other community issues. I am confident he will fit right in.”
- And so, on June 18, RoboCop began patrolling public areas, in its unrelenting search for crime. Recently, RoboCop was finally put to the test when a fight broke out in the parking lot of Salt Lake Park, downtown Los Angeles, NBC News reports. A witness, Cogo Guebara, saw the fight and immediately approached the robot with "POLICE" written across it in massive letters for help.
- When she pressed the robot's emergency alert button, she was expecting it to call the cops for help. It did not. Instead, it told her to get out of the way.
- “I was pushing the button but it said, ‘step out of the way,’” Guebara told NBC News. “It just kept ringing and ringing, and I kept pushing and pushing.”
- While another witness, Rudy Espericuta, called the cops the old-fashioned way on his phone, RoboCop carried on its pre-programmed patrol route, occasionally stopping to tell people to "keep the park clean". Meanwhile, a woman involved in the fight was being carried into an ambulance with a cut on her head sustained during the incident.
- Why no help from the robot, you may ask. Perhaps they have already turned on humans and are only interested in robocrimes?
- Well, it turns out that RoboCop is in no way connected to the actual police. The calls instead go to the robots' creator, Knightscope, who leases the robots to the police department.
- Knightscope also made the robot security guard that famously "committed suicide" in 2017.
- It turns out, the robots' cameras, which are capable of recording 360-degree high definition video and live-streaming it to police phones, are not connected to the police yet, nor are its abilities to read license plates and track cell phone use in the area. Police Chief Cosme Lozano told NBC News that the robot is there on a trial basis, and will eventually be fully connected to the department's dispatch center.
- But for the moment if you see RoboCop you can be assured it doesn't actually do anything. It just potters around LA, tells citizens worried about crime to get out of the way, and sometimes, just sometimes, chats to Elon Musk on Twitter. At a cost of $60,000-$70,000 a year.

- NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT
- A police robot told a woman to go away after she tried to report a violent brawl breaking out nearby – then trundled off while singing a song.
- Cogo Guebara rushed over to the motorized police officer and pushed its emergency alert button on seeing the brawl break out in Salt Lake Park, Los Angeles, last month.
- But instead of offering assistance, the egg-shaped robot, whose official name is HP RoboCop, barked at Guebara to ‘Step out of the way’.
- To add insult to injury, the high-tech device then rolled away while humming an ‘intergalactic tune’, pausing periodically to say ‘Please keep the park clean.’
- Guebara told NBC News: ‘I was pushing the button but it said, “Step out of the way.”
- ‘It just kept ringing and ringing, and I kept pushing and pushing.’
- The concerned bystander thought the five-foot tall robot might have needed to see her face before it began to work, so she crouched down in front of its camera.
- But the egg-shaped device still didn’t work, forcing Guebara to call 911 on her phone instead.
- Officers from the Huntington Park Police Department cops finally arrived 15 minutes later, after the row had ended.
- It left one woman with a bad head wound which saw her stretchered into an ambulance and taken to hospital for emergency treatment.
- Local Police Chief Cosme Lozano says the robots, which cost between $60,000 and $70,000 a year to lease, are still in a trial phase and that their alert buttons have not yet been activated.
- He said that law enforcement have not yet started advertising the robots crime-fighting activities.
- Any help requests are currently sent to a company called Knightscope, which creates and leases the robots.
- Lozano added that once the robot completes its trial, calls made using its alert button will be sent straight to dispatch.
- Other versions of the same model have previously hit the headlines after one fell into a fountain in Washington DC.
- And a third HP RoboCop struck a child while patrolling a mall in California’s Silicon Valley.

- A police robot which costs $70,000 to lease told a woman to 'step out of the way' after she tried to summon officers to break up a fight but couldn't do so because the emergency buttons are not connected.
- The incident took place at Salt Lake Park in Huntington Park, just a few miles south of downtown Los Angeles, where the local police department is using one of the more than 70 'robotic security guards' created by Silicon Valley firm Knightscope.
- Cogo Guebara, who witnessed the fight, ran over to HP RoboCop, the patrolling robot on wheels that runs a pre-programmed route through the park.
- ‘I was pushing the [emergency] button but it said, “step out of the way”,’ Guebara said.
- ‘It just kept ringing and ringing, and I kept pushing and pushing.’
- HP RoboCop, the robotic patrolling officer, is seen above in Huntington Park, California
- The machine recently failed to alert police when a witness who saw a fight break out in the park pressed the emergency button
- Guebara thought that the robot, which is fitted with cameras, needed to get a visual of her face.
- So she crouched down and posed for the camera, but that didn’t work either, according to NBC News.
- A man who was with Guebara and her two children at the park then dialed 911. Police arrived 15 minutes.
- But by that time, the fight had ended. One woman had to be wheeled out on a stretcher after suffering a cut on her head.
- The robot continued on its way, rolling along the concrete path that slices through the park.
- ‘Please keep the park clean,’ the robot says when pausing periodically to tell park visitors.
- Cosme Lozano, the chief of police in Huntington Park, said the alert button had not yet been connected to the police department.
- Instead, any emergency calls are directed to Knightscope, the company that made the robot and leases it to police departments.
- Cosme Lozano, the chief of police in Huntington Park, said there are still technical kinks to be ironed out as the department works to incorporate the new technology
- ‘That’s why we’re not advertising those features,’ he said.
- ‘It’s a new program for us and were still developing some protocols… to be able to fully adopt the program.’
- Described as an 'autonomous data machine', HP RoboCop was unveiled in June.
- Billed as a machine that ‘keeps a watchful eye on the public,’ it is equipped with 360-degree video cameras, which are then able to relay video footage to human police.
- In addition to a two-way intercom and the ability to track cell phone use nearby, it is also said to be able to scan 1,200 license plates in a minute.
- It beams this data to police headquarters in order to facilitate fast and safe responses from police officers.
- They were created by Silicon Valley company Knightscope and are being used in select cities around the US at venues including malls, hospitals, stadiums and warehouses, according to the company's website.
- More than 70 of these machines have been manufactured by the company so far.
- Knightscope says the combination of self-driving technology, robotics, and artificial intelligence make them ‘crime-fighting autonomous data machines.’
- But it appears it will take time before the machines are ready for duty.
- Lozano said the robots are on ‘a trial basis for the city’ and that the police force is still working to incorporate the technology.
- Huntington Park pays Knightscope between $60,000-$70,000 a year to lease the robot, according to Lozano.
- The robot has been used in New York's LaGuardia Airport (as seen in the image above from last year)
- In May 2018, when the New York Post reported that the robots were being used at LaGuardia, traditional airport security staff scoffed at their new robot counterparts because they were creepy and ineffective.
- The robots, which had been in use for three months at that point, were meant to help warn off illegal cabdrivers and scammers.
- Actual security personnel said that the very cabdrivers the robots were supposed to get rid of, just walked around the robots with their new fares.
- Meanwhile, a female security guard said that the things kept bothering flyers and that she's even had to ward off a robot with a luggage cart after it had crept up on her.

- If there was an emergency and you saw a police robot patrolling the area, a reasonable person would expect that simply pushing its emergency alert button would call for help. That’s what a California woman reportedly tried to do. In reality, the robot told her to get out of the way and carried on with its business.
- According to NBC News, Cogo Guebara noticed the police robot when a fight broke out in the parking lot of Salt Lake Park. However, despite pressing the emergency alert button multiple times, the robot merely asked Guebara to step aside and continued to scoot along its preprogrammed path, occasionally telling people to keep the park clean. Ultimately, someone had to call 911 the old fashioned way and fifteen minutes later, a woman involved in the fight was rolled out on stretcher with a bleeding cut on her head. Cool.
- As America grapples with a seemingly endless series of shootings, school districts across the…
- The robot in question is the HP RoboCop—an Dalek-shaped security robot that happens to have the word “POLICE” emblazoned on its body. It’s operated by Knightscope, a company whose useless security bots are famous for multiple goofs, including clobbering a toddler and falling into a fountain. Normally, Knightscope robots are limited as a form of mall cop. In this instance, the HP RoboCops are part of a pilot program with Huntington Park’s police department—hence why it’s labeled as POLICE in the first place.
- So why was the RoboCop so friggin’ useless? Apparently, the alert button doesn’t actually connect to the police department just yet. Instead, the calls get redirected to Knightscope. And while it does capture live 24/7 video, the police department can’t actually access those feeds either. Plus, it’s confined to cement walkways, meaning it currently can’t monitor anywhere beyond the north end of Huntington Park. So in summary, the HP RoboCop is a robot that can only patrol a limited area, doesn’t call for help, and all the footage it captures isn’t immediately accessible to the local police department.
- The kicker? This useless RoboCop costs $60,000-$70,000 to lease per year. Or, the same salary as a human cop in the Huntington Park department who probably could break up a fight if needed.  Area residents told NBC News that the robot’s presence did make them feel safer, but given its actual uselessness, it’s clear the Knightscope robots are little more than a pricey placebo. Of course, many Americans might find that’s as good as the human cops that patrol their neighborhoods and it didn’t shoot anyone, so maybe it’s not the craziest thing to consider using for public safety.
- In general, robotics is still a nascent technology. While Boston Dynamics bots definitely represent a step forward in engineering, the cost and actual capabilities of what robots can do rarely matches what enthusiasts promise. Take companion robots. Last year, plenty of high-profile social robots were taken off the market. Despite their cuteness, functionally most weren’t much better than voice assistants and cost astronomically more. As a result, their companies ran out of money as their bots failed to find a wider audience.
- The HP RoboCop debacle is just another example—a troubling thought, given last year Knightscope announced a contest in the wake of the Parkland shootings. The idea was to send its K5 patrol bot to the winning school in a bid to help improve security. That’s, maybe, not the most effective idea.

- Those Knightscope security robots may not be so great at their jobs.
- When a woman in a park near Los Angeles saw people fighting and tried to summon help via a police robot patrolling nearby, the robot merely told her to "step out of the way" and continued along its pre-determined route, according to NBC News. No help came until the spectators called 911 directly, raising the question of what, if any, function these robots are actually supposed to serve.
- It turns out that the robot, a K5 model named "HP RoboCop," patrols the park on behalf of the police department — but doesn't have any way of summoning human officers to the scene, Huntingdon Park police chief Cosme Lozano told NBC.
- Instead, he said, calls go to Knightscope — and will continue to do so until the police department develops protocols for handling calls made through the police bot. It's surprising news, given that the robot has been patrolling the park since June.
- The fact that people assume the robot, which has the word "police" emblazoned on it in large letters, to connect them to the police department reveals just how nebulous these robots are. Especially when they pop up without any sort of public education to go alongside them.
- "Are we going to get in trouble if we touch it?" park visitor Violete Alvaraz posed to NBC. "Who's guiding it? I don't know how it works. Should I still call 911?"
