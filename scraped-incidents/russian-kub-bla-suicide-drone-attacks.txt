- The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reports that Russia appears to be using Kalashnikov ZALA Aero KUB-BLA loitering drones in its war with Ukraine. Per Kalashnikov, KUB-BLAs are able to select and strike targets through inputted coordinates or autonomously, with the system capable of 'real-time recognition and classification of detected objects' using AI, according (pdf) to the Netherlands-based peace organisation Pax for Peace.
- Open source intelligence together with images released by the Russian government indicate AI technologies are being used widely in the Russia-Ukraine war, raising concerns about the ethics and accuracy of so-called 'killer robots'.
- The Ukrainian air force has also been using Bayraktar TB2 drones during the war to devastating effect.

- JSC Kalashnikov Concern (Russian: Конце́рн Кала́шников, tr. Kontsérn Kaláshnikov, IPA: [kɐnˈt͡sɛrn kɐˈɫaʂnʲɪkəf]), known until 2013 as the Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant (Russian: Иже́вский машинострои́тельный Заво́д (ИЖМАШ), tr. Izhévsky mashinostroítelny Zavod (IZhMASh)),[4][5] is a Russian defense manufacturing concern and joint-stock company headquartered in the city of Izhevsk in the Republic of Udmurtia as well as the capital city of Moscow. The concern designs and produces a wide range of civilian and military weapons including assault rifles, sniper rifles, designated marksman rifles, machine guns, squad automatic weapons, hunting rifles, shotguns, guided artillery projectiles, and a wide range of other precision weapons including remote controlled weapon stations, unmanned vehicles and military robots.[6][7][8]
- The Kalashnikov Concern produces about 95% of all small arms in Russia and supplies to more than 27 countries around the world, making it the largest firearm manufacturer in Russia. Notable products include the Kalashnikov (AK) assault rifle series, the RPK light machine gun series, the Dragunov SVD semi-automatic sniper rifle, the SKS semi-automatic carbine, the Makarov PM pistol, the Saiga-12 shotgun, and the submachine guns Vityaz-SN and PP-19 Bizon. These firearms, except for the SVD, SKS and the PM, were based on the famous AK series, due to its reliability to endure harsh conditions, low production costs, availability in nearly every geographical region, and ease of use.[8][9]
- As of 2018, 26% of the Concern's shares belong to Rostec, while 74% of the company belongs to private investors (Alexey Krivoruchko, Andrei Bokarev and Nikolaos i. Panagogiannopoulos).[10]
- The Concern contains three firearm brands: "Kalashnikov" (combat and civilian weapons), "Baikal" (hunting and civilian guns), and "Izhmash" (sporting rifles). The concern is developing new business lines that include remote weapon stations, unmanned aerial and ground vehicles, and multi-functional special-purpose boats.[11]
- An armory in the city of Izhevsk was established by the order of the Emperor of All Russias Alexander I on 10 June 1807 and Andrey Deryabin, the chief mining engineer of the city's iron works, was put in charge with both construction and operation. Architect Semyon Emelianovich Dudin and Deryabin both developed a general long-term plan of further complex growth of the armory. The armory would be located at the bank of the Izh River, mainly due to the proximity of iron works, which immediately solved all the raw material supply problems.[8][12][13]
- Deryabin employed Russian and Udmurtian plowmen living in the city. At that time, plowmen were to migrate to the armory and work there. Settlements nearby were released from this rule, but had to provide the armory with wagons, horses and harnessing. Deryabin also hired foreign armory specialists to guide the Russian craftsmen. In 1807, the Armory produced 7 long guns, 5 pair of pistols, and 6 backswords.[12]
- The first weapons developed by the armory were the No. 15 17.7mm muskets, produced in the autumn of 1807. In 1808, the musket was later mass-produced for infantry equipping. The plant supplied the Imperial Russian Army with over 6,000 of the No. 15 17.7mm muskets. The armory also produced rifles, muskets, carbines, and flint blunderbusses for cavalry in 1809. The venture also produced pistols and gun parts and remelted trophy weapons. Firearms were produced at a rapid pace for the Russian Army during the Napoleonic Wars, mainly in the French invasion of Russia, even though construction of the armory had not been finished yet. During the first four years, the factory produced 2,000 long guns. In 1814, the output grew up to 10,000 guns and almost 2,500 backswords. By 1830, the armory achieved the desired annual output of 25,000 long guns and 5,000 backswords.[8][12][13]
- Ten stone plants, several wooden constructions and a towered main building for the armory were erected in 1811–1816. By 1817, construction of the main armory building had been finished. It had 4 floors and was one of the first multistory industrial buildings in Russia. The manufacturing process was multilevel: it began with rough preparatory works (at lower floors) and finished with assembly of arms (at higher floors).[12][citation needed]
- Starting in the 1830s, the armory started manufacturing "Gartung" short rifles, "Phalis" breech-loading rifles, and boarding guns for the Baltic Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy. In 1835, the armory transferred cold steel production of swords and lances to Zlatoust, focusing mainly on firearm production. In 1844, the armory started upgrading current guns into more rapid firing percussion muskets. The armory also started using the caplock mechanism for its products in 1845. During the Crimean War, Izhevsk supplied the Russian Imperial Army with 130,000 rifles, with a third of them grooved. By 1857, 50 years after the creation of the armory, over 670,000 flintlock firearms, over 220,000 percussion firearms, over 58 thousand rifles, as well as a plentiful number of swords and lances were produced.[12][13][citation needed]
- In 1867, the armory was reorganized into a lease and a private commercial enterprise. At this time, the armory was retrofitted and equipped with steam-engines, new machines, and an open-hearth furnace. This allowed the armory to produce more breech-loading weapons for the Russian Imperial Army, notably the "Krnk" and "Berdan" type rifles. The Berdan rifle was the most widely produced firearm at the plant during the time as well, indirectly allowing Russia to approach the European industrial empires' level of armaments.[12]
- By 1870, production rate at the armory exceeded both the armories of Tula and Sestroretsk. Later, when the methods of high-quality steel production were well mastered, Izhevsk became the source of gun barrels and barrel receivers for Russian plants. For example, armory enterprises in Tula used annually up to 360,000 barrels from the armory at Izhevsk. In 1884, the plant was later returned to the state and became Izhevsk Gun and Steel Factories (IGSF). In 1885, IGSF started manufacturing hunting weapons and tools. In 1891, IGSF started mass-producing the Mosin–Nagant rifle. The IGSF also started using DC generators to produce electricity to illuminate the plant as well as to power the machines. The IGSF was the only Russian enterprise that produced firearms for all branches of the Russian military. Thanks to the IGSF, Izhevsk became a large industrial center in Russia.[12][citation needed]
- During the First World War, IGSF supplied the Imperial Russian Army with over 1.4 million new rifles and approximately 188,000 remelted shoulder weapons. Prior to the Russian Revolution, the IGSF took leading positions of the Russian defense industry in terms of manufacturing and manpower capacity. By 1917, about 34,000 people worked at IGSF. In 1918, a design bureau was established in the IGSF.[12][13]
- After the formation of the Soviet Union in 1922, large changes came to the IGSF. The state's first hunting gun factory was opened on the enterprise's premises in the same year. The IGSF required more highly trained personnel in order to accommodate new production and to work on newer machines. Thus, by 1929, IGSF-bound personnel had to be trained at the Izhevsk Technical School. In 1930, a new open-hearth furnace was put into operation and in-house production of machines at the factory was launched.[12]
- More re-organization took place in the 1930s, including the conversion of the IGSF into a Chief Designer Bureau, as well as the adoption and production of several new models of firearms: a modified Mosin–Nagant rifle design of 1891/1930, the battle rifle AVS-36, made by Sergei Simonov, and the SVT-38 self-loading rifle and the TT pistol, made by Fedor Tokorev. This gave rise to a flow line method of production. In 1938, the conveyor belt was implemented into the assembly of gun barrels and other parts, greatly increasing the production rate of firearms for the Soviet Army. In 1933, a New Design Bureau, "BNK", was established at the factory to develop and modify firearms. Today, the bureau is named the "Armory Design Center" (KOC). In the bureau's lifetime, about 300 models of small-arms, air ordnance, sport, hunting weapons, and other types of equipment were developed, most of which was in series production at the plant. In 1939, the main plant of the IGSF, Plant No. 180,was split into two independent enterprises: Metallurgical Plant No. 71 and Engineering Plant No. 74, which manufactured weapons. Engineering Plant No. 74 would later be renamed the Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant, or simply, Izhmash.[12]
- During World War II, Engineering Plant No. 74 served as the main firearm manufacturer for the Soviet Armed Forces. Since Operation Barbarossa left the Soviet Union in a very desperate position, the plant produced as many firearms as it was physically capable of, more firearms than its lifespan for 92 years prior. From 1941 to 1942, the plant set up mass production of Vasily Degtyarev's PTRD anti-tank rifle, Sergei Simonov's PTRS-41 anti-tank rifle, the Berezin UB aircraft machine gun armament, the 37mm Shpitalny Sh-37 and Nudelman-Suranov NS-37 aircraft guns, and sniper rifles with optic sights, along with the TT pistol and the Nagant M1895 revolver.[citation needed] A total of 11,450,000 rifles and carbines were produced in the plant, exceeding all the combined German firearm manufacturers' outputs of 10.3 million. Besides firearms, the plant also produced over 15,000 aircraft guns and over 130,000 anti-tank weapons.[12][13]
- On 20 July 1942, Plant No. 622 separated itself from Plant No. 74, using equipment transferred from the evacuated mechanical plants at Tula and Podolsk. During the war, the plant manufactured more than 1 million pistols and 200,000 anti-tank rifles. Plant No. 622 would later be renamed as the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, or simply, Izhmekh.[12]
- After World War II, the Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant later recovered the production of its civilian arms and transportation. The plant also hired war veteran and ex-tank driver and mechanic, Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, after noticing his submachine gun design that gave him distinction as a gun designer. In 1947, Kalashnikov created his assault rifle, the 7.62×39mm AK-47. The AK-47 became the standard rifle of the Soviet Army in the same year, and later grew popular around the world. The AK-47 gave the plant fame and newer potential in the arms industry. The plant also created newer hunting weapons based out of the Mosin–Nagant rifle as well as sporting weapons. These sporting weapons helped the Soviet Union's team to win shooting competitions in European championships and the Summer Olympic Games numerous times.[12][13][14]
- Kalashnikov later designed newer firearms: the AKM and the AK-74 assault rifle, the RPK light machine gun, and the PK belt-fed machine gun. These firearms helped contribute to greater firepower for the Soviet Army as well as numerous nations that had imported them. Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant gun designer Yevgeny Dragunov also help contribute to the plant's fame by creating his SVD sniper rifle. Designed in 1963 and based out of sporting rifles, the SVD became the squad support weapon for the Soviet Army in the same year as well as starting a new trend of semi-automatic sniper rifles.[12][14]
- In 1975, the Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant changed its name to the Izhmash Industrial Association.[9]
- After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Izhmash struggled with a decline in demand and competition with overseas firearm manufacturers. As a result, Izhmash created the Saiga semi-automatic rifle, and started producing the Tigr, a civilian version of the SVD which was created back in the 1970s, in batches. Izhmash also expanded to the Western market, which was extremely successful, especially with the Saiga. Izhmash also created two new sniper rifles, the SV-98 and the SV-99, which had a more enhanced fire precision than the regular SVD, for special units of the Russian Armed Forces.[12][14]
- Despite the success, by 2008, Izhmash was composed of numerous enterprises that were on the verge of bankruptcy. The Russian state corporation, Rostekhnologii (Russian Technologies, now Rostec), revealed the poor state Izhmash was in by 2010. Only 32 companies of Izhmash were actually operating with a multi-level management system, high overheads and doubled up functions. The combined liability of Izhmash in early 2011 was ₽19 billion. The use of the existing modern equipment hardly exceeded 20%.[9]
- As a result, Rostec took control of Izhmash and started restructuring and consolidating the company in 2011. According to Rostec, one of the objectives was to retain its research, industrial and human resources and turn Izhmash into a leading global small arms manufacturer. Izhmash was later reestablished through assets consolidation by 2012. As a result, there was a threefold increase in profits and a 10% cut in costs. In 2011, Izhmash increased the utilization rate of modern multipurpose equipment from 20% to 70%. The effect from the efforts to enhance production performance amounts to ₽100 million.[9]
- On 13 August 2013, Izhmash and Izhmekh (formerly Izhevsk Mechanical Plant) merged, with the new concern named Kalashnikov Concern. Thanks to the merger, Kalashnikov Concern is Russia's largest and most important arms manufacturer.[15]
- In July 2014, Kalashnikov Concern was sanctioned by the United States and the European Union as a result of the Russian annexation of Crimea and Russian military intervention in Ukraine.[16] Since Europe and the United States were the largest customers of the concern's civilian firearms, the concern was forced to rethink its marketing strategy. The concern opened five new markets and started selling its civilian firearms to ten new foreign countries, which helped the concern make up for its losses.[17]
- In the same year, Kalashnikov Concern has presented "Strategy 2020", which includes technical re-equipment and production modernization. When implemented, the project will qualitatively improve production technology and greatly reduce running costs and energy consumption while also improving working conditions and overall productivity.[18][19]
- On 9 February 2017, Rostec's management board gave permission to transfer Kalashnikov Concern to private investors. As of now, Rostec owns 26% of the concern while private investors own 74%.[10]
- In 2022, the Concern had reportedly achieved a 40% record yearly increase in weapons production for domestic needs and for export and also completed one licensed production agreement.[20] The Concern reported in May 2023 that it had achieved a 10-year record in weapons deliveries during the first quarter of the year[21] and that it has established a drone production unit.[22]
- JSC "Kalashnikov Concern" has its headquarters in city of Izhevsk and the Khamovniki District in the capital city of Moscow.[23]
- JSC "Kalashnikov Concern" is composed of the two largest firearm manufacturers in Izhevsk:[15][24]
- JSC "Kalashnikov Concern" divides its firearm products into three brands.[25]
- JSC "Kalashnikov Concern" has four subsidiaries:[24]
- Vladimir Grodetsky, who headed Izhmash NPO since 1996 as general director left the bureau in 2011. He was later replaced by Maxim Kuzyuk, who left the bureau in June 2012. Alexander Kosov was later appointed as a temporary general director of the bureau from June to December. In December 2012, Konstantin Busygin was appointed general director of Izhmash. Busygin was later responsible for transformation of Izhmash and Izhmekh into the JSC "Kalashnikov" Concern, of which he became CEO.[26]
- On 30 January 2014, Rostec's supervisory board approved the appointment of Alexei Krivoruchko, its new shareholder, as CEO of the Kalashnikov Concern, replacing Konstantin Busygin. He took up his duties on 31 January 2014. According to the interlocutor of the agency, since 2011, this is the fourth change of the general director at the enterprise.[26]
- In August 2021 Vladimir Lepin was appointed Kalashnikov Concern CEO in place of Dmitry Tarasov.[27]
- For 2020 the board of directors is headed by Alexander Nazarov[28][29][30]
- Although the arsenal was under construction in 1807, production of weapons immediately started: mainly long guns, pistols, and backswords. One notable long gun the arsenal made was the No. 15 17.7mm muskets, of which 6,000 of them were supplied to the Imperial Russian Army. The arsenal later manufactured rifles, muskets, carbines, and flint blunderbusses for cavalry in 1809. The venture also produced pistols and gun parts and remelted trophy weapons. Firearms were produced at a rapid pace for the Russian Army during the Napoleonic Wars, mainly in the French invasion of Russia, even though construction of the armory had not been finished yet. During the first four years, the factory produced 2,000 long guns. In 1814, the output grew up to 10,000 guns and almost 2,500 backswords. By 1830, the armory achieved the desired annual output of 25,000 long guns and 5,000 backswords.[8][12][13]

The Berdan rifle, designed by American firearm expert and inventor Hiram Berdan, became the standard issue rifle of the Imperial Russian Army in 1870. The Berdan rifle was the most produced firearm of the plant at the time as well, allowing Russia to approach the European industrial empires' level of armaments.[12]
- In 1884, the plant was returned to the state and became Izhevsk Gun and Steel Factories (IGSF). In 1885, IGSF started manufacturing hunting weapons and tools. In 1891, IGSF started mass-producing the Mosin–Nagant bolt-action military rifle in a development of nine years, based on the design of the 1898 Mauser rifle (Gewehr 98) with new unique features such as a push feed recessed bolt head. In addition to being one of the most produced rifles in mass-produced military bolt-action rifles in history, the Nagant is also used in every war from the time it was developed to the modern day. The rifle was produced from both the Imperial period and the Soviet era, with military production concluded in 1965, but production for civilian use is continued to the modern day. In addition to the Mosin–Nagant rifle, Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant, who was a co-inventor of, developed the Nagant M1895 revolver. The revolver has a unique "gas-seal" system that provides a boost to muzzle velocity as well as make the weapon suppressed. The sidearm, like the Nagant rifle, was produced in the Soviet era as well, and was mass-produced and used widespread.[12][31]
- On August 23, 2018, Kalashnikov Concern introduced a new electric car prototype, the CV-1. Its exterior design was based on the rare 1970s Soviet large family car IZh 2125 "Kombi". The range on one charge was claimed to be 350 km.[45][46]
- Alongside the reveal of the CV-1, Kalashnikov also showed a prototype for the UV-4 4-door electric quadricycle, with a taxi variant being revealed in August 2019. The UV-4 was shown again in patent images later in November 2021, this time along with a 3-wheel, 2-door vehicle based on it.[47]

- A Russian “suicide drone” that boasts the ability to identify targets using artificial intelligence has been spotted in images of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
- Photographs showing what appears to be the KUB-BLA, a type of lethal drone known as a “loitering munition” sold by ZALA Aero, a subsidiary of the Russian arms company Kalashnikov, have appeared on Telegram and Twitter in recent days. The pictures show damaged drones that appear to have either crashed or been shot down.
- With a wingspan of 1.2 meters, the sleek white drone resembles a small pilotless fighter jet. It is fired from a portable launch, can travel up to 130 kilometers per hour for 30 minutes, and deliberately crashes into a target, detonating a 3-kilo explosive.
- ZALA Aero, which first demoed the KUB-BLA at a Russian air show in 2019, claims in promotional material that it features “intelligent detection and recognition of objects by class and type in real time.”
- The drone itself may do little to alter the course of the war in Ukraine, as there is no evidence that Russia is using them widely so far. But its appearance has sparked concern about the potential for AI to take a greater role in making lethal decisions.
- “The notion of a killer robot—where you have artificial intelligence fused with weapons—that technology is here, and it's being used,” says Zachary Kallenborn, a research affiliate with the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START).
- Advances in AI have made it easier to incorporate autonomy into weapons systems, and have raised the prospect that more capable systems could eventually decide for themselves who to kill. A UN report published last year concluded that a lethal drone with this capability may have been used in the Libyan civil war.
- Tom Simonite
- Gregory Barber
- Tom Simonite and Gian M. Volpicelli
- It is unclear if the drone may have been operated in this way in Ukraine. One of the challenges with autonomous weapons may prove to be the difficulty of determining when full autonomy is used in a lethal context, Kallenborn says.
- The KUB-BLA images have yet to be verified by official sources, but the drone is known to be a relatively new part of Russia’s military arsenal. Its use would also be consistent with Russia’s shifting strategy in the face of the unexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance, says Samuel Bendett, an expert on Russia’s military with the defense think tank CNA.
- Bendett says Russia has built up its drone capabilities in recent years, using them in Syria and acquiring more after Azerbaijani forces demonstrated their effectiveness against Armenian ground military in the 2020 ​​Nagorno-Karabakh war. “They are an extraordinarily cheap alternative to flying manned missions,” he says. “They are very effective both militarily and of course psychologically.”
- The fact that Russia seems to have used few drones in Ukraine early on may be due to misjudging the resistance or because of effective Ukrainian countermeasures.

- Chris Stokel-Walker
- But drones have also highlighted a key vulnerability in Russia’s invasion, which is now entering its third week. Ukrainian forces have used a remotely operated Turkish-made drone called the TB2 to great effect against Russian forces, shooting guided missiles at Russian missile launchers and vehicles. The paraglider-sized drone, which relies on a small crew on the ground, is slow and cannot defend itself, but it has proven effective against a surprisingly weak Russian air campaign.
- This week, the Biden administration also said it would supply Ukraine with a small US-made loitering munition called Switchblade. This single-use drone, which comes equipped with explosives, cameras, and guided systems, has some autonomous capabilities but relies on a person to make decisions about which targets to engage.
- But Bendett questions whether Russia would unleash an AI-powered drone with advanced autonomy in such a chaotic environment, especially given how poorly coordinated the country’s overall air strategy seems to be. “The Russian military and its capabilities are now being severely tested in Ukraine,” he says. “If the [human] ground forces with all their sophisticated information gathering can't really make sense of what's happening on the ground, then how could a drone?”
- Several other military experts question the purported capabilities of the KUB-BLA.
- “The companies that produce these loitering drones talk up their autonomous features, but often the autonomy involves flight corrections and maneuvering to hit a target identified by a human operator, not autonomy in the way the international community would define an autonomous weapon,” says Michael Horowitz, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who keeps track of military technology.
- Despite such uncertainties, the issue of AI in weapons systems has become contentious of late because the technology is rapidly finding its way into many military systems, for example to help interpret input from sensors. The US military maintains that a person should always make lethal decisions, but the US also opposes a ban on the development of such systems.
- To some, the appearance of the KUB-BLA shows that we are on a slippery slope toward increasing use of AI in weapons that will eventually remove humans from the equation.
- “We'll see even more proliferation of such lethal autonomous weapons unless more Western nations start supporting a ban on them,” says Max Tegmark, a professor at MIT and cofounder of the Future of Life Institute, an organization that campaigns against such weapons.
- Others, though, believe that the situation unfolding in Ukraine shows how difficult it will really be to use advanced AI and autonomy.
- William Alberque, Director of Strategy, Technology, and Arms Control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies says that given the success that Ukraine has had with the TB2, the Russians are not ready to deploy tech that is more sophisticated. “We’re seeing Russian morons getting owned by a system that they should not be vulnerable to.”

- Pictures being shared online show what appear to be destroyed, Russian-made "suicide drones" that deploy artificial intelligence to identify their targets, Wired reports.
- Experts are outraged, arguing the use of "killer robots" like these is against internationally agreed-upon rules about what can or cannot be used on the battlefield. In this case, allowing algorithms to make decisions over who gets to live or die is what's at issue.
- "The notion of a killer robot — where you have artificial intelligence fused with weapons — that technology is here, and it's being used," Zachary Kallenborn, a research affiliate with the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, told Wired.
- The small jets appear to be of the KUB-BLA variety, a Kalashnikov-made drone that can be fired from a portable launcher and travel up to 80 mph for 30 minutes at a time.
- They're designed to intentionally crash into a given target, thereby setting off over six pounds of explosive.
- According to promotional material, the KUB-BLA features an "intelligent detection and recognition of objects by class and type in real time."
- Authorities on the ground have yet to confirm if Russia is using KUB-BLA drones specifically during its barrage of several Ukrainian cities.
- In fact, it may be nearly impossible to tell if the drones used AI to reach their targets, or if they were piloted by Russian operatives remotely, as Kallenborn points out.
- Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces have also made use of drones, remotely-operated ones made by Turkey, to ward off Russian forces.
- It's not only Russia that has been making use of suicide drones, either. The Switchblade, produced by American contractor AeroVironment, has been deployed by US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan for over a decade. In fact, according to Bloomberg, the White House is now arming Ukrainian forces with 100 of the drones.

- May premium magazine: Early warnings and near misses
- By Zachary Kallenborn | March 15, 2022

- Using pictures out of Ukraine showing a crumpled metallic airframe, open-source analysts of the conflict there say they have identified images of a new sort of Russian-made drone, one that the manufacturer says can select and strike targets through inputted coordinates or autonomously. When soldiers give the Kalashnikov ZALA Aero KUB-BLA loitering munition an uploaded image, the system is capable of “real-time recognition and classification of detected objects” using artificial intelligence (AI), according to the Netherlands-based organization Pax for Peace (citing Jane’s International Defence Review). In other words, analysts appear to have spotted a killer robot on the battlefield.
- The images of the weapon, apparently taken in the Podil neighborhood of Kyiv and uploaded to Telegram on March 12, do not indicate whether the KUB-BLA, manufactured by Kalashnikov Group of AK-47 fame, was used in its autonomous mode. The drone appears intact enough that digital forensics might be possible, but the challenges of verifying autonomous weapons use mean we may never know whether it was operating entirely autonomously. Likewise, whether this is Russia’s first use of AI-based autonomous weapons in conflict is also unclear: Some published analyses suggests the remains of a mystery drone found in 2019 Syria was from a KUB-BLA (though, again, the drone may not have used the autonomous function).
- Nonetheless, assuming open-source analysts are right, the event illustrates well that autonomous weapons using artificial intelligence are here. And what’s more, the technology is proliferating fast. The KUB-BLA is not the first AI-based autonomous weapon to be used in combat. In 2020, during the conflict in Libya, a United Nations report said the Turkish Kargu-2 “hunted down and remotely engaged” logistics convoys and retreating forces. The Turkish government denied the Kargu-2 was used autonomously (and, again, it’s quite tough to know either way), but the Turkish Undersecretary for Defense and Industry acknowledged Turkey can field that capability.

- Autonomous weapons have generated significant global concern. A January 22, 2019 Ipsos poll found that 61 percent of respondents across 26 countries oppose the use of lethal autonomous weapons. Thousands of artificial intelligence researchers have also signed a pledge by the Future of Life Institute against allowing machines to take human life. These concerns are well-justified. Current artificial intelligence is particularly brittle; it can be easily fooled or make mistakes. For example, a single pixel can convince an artificial intelligence that a stealth bomber is a dog. A complex, dynamic battlefield filled with smoke and debris makes correct target identification even harder, posing risk to both civilians and friendly soldiers. Even if no one is harmed, errors may simply prevent the system from achieving the military objective.
- The open questions are: What will the global community do about autonomous weapons? What should it do?
- In the first case the answer is pretty clear: Almost certainly nothing. International norms around autonomous weapons are quite nascent, and large, powerful countries, including the United States, have pushed back against them. Even if there were broadly accepted norms, it’s not clear how much more could be done. Russia is already under harsh, punishing sanctions for its actions in Ukraine. The US Congress just approved a $13.6 billion Ukraine aid bill, which includes providing Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. The United States and its allies have also been clear they have little appetite for direct military intervention in the conflict. Plus, how much can the global community really do without knowing for sure what happened? But Russia’s apparent use of the KUB-BLA does lend greater urgency to broader international discussions around autonomous weapons.
- The state of autonomous weapons discussions. Last week, global governments met in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons to discuss questions raised by autonomous weapons, including whether new binding treaties are needed. Arms control advocates have not been successful in winning support for a binding treaty banning autonomous weapons so far. The convention’s process requires member states to reach consensus on any changes to the treaty. The United States, Russia, and Israel have significant concerns, and various others do not support a ban. The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons process just is not going anywhere.
- Nonetheless, the discussions at the convention have had great value in clarifying options and positions. Delegates to the convention have previously identified four general approaches for addressing autonomous weapons: a legally-binding instrument; a political declaration; strengthening the application of existing international humanitarian laws; and the option of doing nothing. In addition, there’s likely a fifth possibility: Countries could, where applicable, raise the issue of autonomous weapons in discussions on other weapons treaties, like those addressing nuclear or chemical weapons.
- A legally-binding comprehensive ban on autonomous weapons would represent the strongest possible measure. But the reality is that major military powers would never support this tack. The active protection and close-in weapon systems they use to defend military platforms from incoming missiles and other attacks are simply too valuable.
- Advocates might have some greater success if they rally around the position of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which offers an option for common ground. The organization’s position on autonomous weapons focuses on their risky aspects. It recommends a ban on unpredictable autonomous weapons, autonomous weapons that target human beings, and various regulations on other sorts of “non prohibited” autonomous weapons. The committee’s position also would likely remove the autonomous weapons militaries depend on, like active protection systems and close-in weapon systems, from a potential ban.
- Alternatively, governments could focus on better implementing existing international humanitarian law. They could develop a set best practices, practical measures, and general information sharing to improve compliance with international humanitarian law for autonomous weapons. Developing best practices might include ensuring weapons undergo rigorous testing; developing military doctrine, training practices, and procedures to increase the accuracy of any weapons; or undertaking a legal review of weapons use. However, there is an underlying question of how well autonomous weapons can comply with existing humanitarian law. If failure is rampant and occurs even with best practices in place, then those measures are not enough. Conversely, if those measures do effectively—or even drastically—reduce the risk, then perhaps this approach is useful. Of course, error rates may vary between weapon systems: perhaps risk can be  reduced reliably in some types of weapons, but not others. This may lead to future discussions about narrow bans, better informed by battlefield experiences.
- Or countries could just issue a political declaration about the necessity of human control. This might be the easiest approach because no one would be required to give up or alter their weapon systems. But that may also place countries in an awkward position: If human control is necessary, why have autonomous weapons? At the same time, advocates for a ban on the weapons might oppose a declaration with minimal effects on military activity. So, ironically, the seemingly easiest compromise actually might be the least likely.
- Last, countries could simply ignore the growing tide of public opinion against autonomous weapons. This would let militaries keep, without apology, whatever autonomous systems they like, but also could be a challenge in democratic societies where public opinion has at least some effect.
- Autonomous weapons and weapons of mass destruction treaties. Another possibility for placing some sort of guidelines around autonomous weapons, one that has garnered minimal attention in Geneva, would be to expand the debate to other international treaty discussions. Treaties around chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons might have applicability to autonomous weapons in certain contexts.
- The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty does not require states to maintain human control over decisions to use nuclear weapons. Incorporating the requirement for human control in some manner might actually get great power support. And that is quite significant, because autonomous nuclear weapons are perhaps the riskiest autonomous weapons. An error could wipe out humanity. (Large autonomous drone swarms are another significant risk.) The congressionally authorized National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence recommended the United States not allow AI to make decisions on firing nuclear weapons. Notably, TopWar, a Russian defense outlet, wrote in support of arms control negotiation on autonomous nuclear weapons on March 8, shortly after the current conflict started.
- Advocates could also raise the topic in Chemical Weapons Convention or the Biological Weapons Convention discussions that consider how potential risks might be limited. The more precise targeting that autonomous weapons offer is quite significant for chemical and biological weapons delivery. Part of why most countries have given up chemical and biological weapons is because delivery is unreliable, making them militarily less useful. An errant wind might blow the agent away from the intended target and towards a friendly or neutral population. But artificial intelligence-aided delivery could change that, and may weaken the existing norms around those weapons further.
- At minimum, states might consider whether and how to adopt export control measures to reduce the risk of algorithms and software designed for dispersal of pesticides or other chemicals falling into the hands of governments that have chemical and biological weapons. Other treaties may also be options for regulating autonomous technologies in some fashion.
- Of course, establishing treaties and norms is only the first step. The next is figuring out an enforcement mechanism: Well, what does the global community do if those treaties and norms are violated? The nature of the response will depend in large part on which option countries can settle on, and how they do so. Arms control advocates might conclude that countries with large, powerful militaries will never be supportive of regulations on autonomous weapons and therefore could attempt to establish a comprehensive ban among whichever states are willing to sign on.
- But if great powers do not support the norm, potential punishments like economic sanctions or military intervention won’t be meaningful. Certain punishments like robust military intervention might require a specific country like the United States to carry it out and accept whatever risks may come. Conversely, if countries settle on a public declaration advocating for human control or strengthening the applicability of existing international law, nothing may happen until after a conflict and the global community considers what, if any, war crimes may have been committed.
- Once again, a potential AI-based autonomous weapon was used in combat. Once again, the details are murky. Once again, the question remains: What do we do now?

- Thank you for paying attention to this topic. In the PAX report mentioned in the article, we state that the weapon systems we analysed have a human approving an attack, and are therefore not autonomous weapons, let alone fully autonomous weapons (aka killer robots). Also with the KUB there is still a human operator approving an attack, so it is not an autonomous weapon per se, as it does not detect and attack targets based on sensor input, and a human still makes the attack decision. These weapons do show the trend towards increasing autonomy and a reducing role of… Read more »

- On Tuesday, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists—the doomsday clock folks—took time out from pondering nuclear holocaust to consider another bleak future. That’s because images posted to Twitter showed that Russia had made use of a so-called loitering munition, in this case, a Kalashnikov ZALA Aero KUB-BLA. That device is described by its manufacturer as a “strike system designed to defeat remote ground targets.”
- It’s a small UAV that, says ZALA Aero, can deliver a “special payload based on target coordinates, which are set manually or based on an image from a target guidance payload.” If it’s not clear, that special payload is an explosive.
- This is a semi-autonomous “kamikaze” drone, and what concerns the atomic scientists, is precisely the “semi-autonomous” part of that description. “Assuming open-source analysts are right,” writes the Bulletin, “the event illustrates well that autonomous weapons using artificial intelligence are here. And what’s more, the technology is proliferating fast.”
- To illustrate this fact, the article appeared exactly one day before the United States announced that it was sending “100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems” to Ukrainian forces. The systems here are Switchblade 300 and 600 “loitering munitions,” which advertise almost exactly the same capabilities as ZALA’s offering.
- In fact, because this is 2022, you can watch dueling videos from the two munitions manufacturers.
- 
- 
- In thinking about how these systems affect the battlefield, imagine if an individual soldier were capable of throwing a fragmentation grenade into the air, and precisely hitting a group of enemy soldiers seven miles away. Or of taking out a vehicle completely hidden behind buildings or trees—or even completely over the horizon. Add in that semi-autonomous factor, and imagine an individual soldier able to loft a weapon that can remain in the air for an extended period, searching out a specific target.
- The war in Ukraine may not actually be a “world war” in the usual sense—thank goodness—but it does seem to be a war that represents the end of an era and the start of something entirely new. It would be nice to think that it’s the beginning of a period in which every national leader understands that launching a war of aggression is so costly that no possible gain is worth the expense. That’s the purpose of the ever-tightening sanctions being levied against Russia.
- But at the very least, this is a war that could wave farewell to the weapons that have defined the battlefield since World War II, and arguably since World War I. Armored vehicles, first designed to survive on battlefields dominated by trench warfare, are facing a new generation of portable anti-tank weapons that have seen an astounding 717 tanks, armored fighting vehicles, and armored transports lost. That’s the verified number. And it’s just on the Russian side.
- Human-portable anti-aircraft systems are extracting a similar cost on jets and helicopters. At least 13 Russian planes and 32 helicopters have already been removed from Russia’s arsenal. Also taken out: at least 8 drones. Because not only can some of those weapons designed to take down conventional aircraft work with UAVs, dedicated anti-drone systems, anti-drone guns, and even anti-drone drones.
- In just three weeks of combat, Ukraine has become not just a war zone, but a laboratory. On the one hand, Russia is using the same tactics of brutality, and the same weapons, that it has deployed for decades to destroy cities and persecute its invasion. On the other hand, Ukraine is defending itself with an arsenal that increasingly depends on weapons designed to take down armor and aircraft. Where Ukraine has been less successful is in degrading Russia’s ability to inflict brutality to civilian areas — but systems like Switchblade might well help with that. Because while a soldier with a rifle can’t do anything about artillery firing from woods five miles away, a soldier with a Switchblade definitely can.
- Performing effective counter-battery fire to take out enemy artillery has traditionally involved radar and essentially more artillery. Loitering munitions change that calculation. Guns that were once firing from a position “safely out of reach” just … aren’t.
- By the way, if 100 Switchblades doesn’t sound like enough to make a difference, each of these systems typically includes a launcher, controller, and 10 of the one-time-use drones. So it’s not 100 units of Russian artillery potentially going down, it’s 1,000.
- Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a limited war. Everyone should hope it remains that way. But it’s going to reshape the world economically, diplomatically, and militarily. Everyone currently in the business of making tanks, armored transport, or military helicopters … needs to diversify. And the Atomic Scientists need to worry about what happens when the “semi” comes out of “semi-autonomous,” because there’s no doubt that’s on the way.

- These warnings have come repeatedly over the last few days, and have been increasing in the last 24 hours. It’s worth remembering that  U.S. intelligence was right about Russia’s intentions even when many others were dismissive of the idea Putin would actually launch an invasion of Ukraine.

- The latest from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as it nears its 18th day.
- Well into its third week, Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to morph as new capabilities are brought to bear and new tactics are deployed. While Russia's side of the conflict appears to have been surprisingly light on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, that is changing. Russia is now posting UAS footage from the front lines much as it did with Syria. And now, for the first time, it is confirmed that Russian suicide drones/loitering munitions have been employed, as well.
- Make sure to check out our most recent rolling coverage update here to get up to speed. Now here is the most recent developments out of the conflict:
- POSTED: 4:20 PM EST—
- A ZALA KYB loitering munition was downed in Kyiv. This is the first known evidence of loitering munitions being used in the conflict. These systems have proven to be decisive in recent wars and are extremely challenging to reliably defend against. The ZALA KYB is a class of loitering munition that would be especially useful for engaging fixed soft targets or targets of opportunity and scouting ahead of friendly forces when equipped with an optical payload.
- As noted earlier, we are also seeing more Russian UAV footage, mostly spotting and providing bomb damage assessment for artillery strikes, which is in line with Russian fighting doctrine:
- Russia is loosening up a bit on frontline videos from the conflict, as well, in an apparent shift in its information operations strategy. Below shows an airborne raid on Hostomel Airport, where the An-225 was destoryed, which has been an incredibly hotly contested locale since shortly after the invasion began. It is not clear what wave of Russian assault the video is from, but the battle there has supposedly been extremely bloody, with the airport changing hands multiple times over a number of days:
- UK MoD's latest general intelligence assessment on new developments in Ukraine and the most up-to-date control map:
- Zelensky claims 1,300 Ukrainian troops have died since the conflict began:
- Ukraine's military forces in Odesa, along with many of its residents, are going all out in making the potential sacking of their city much harder for Russian forces. Similar anti-tank obstacles are apparently distributed all over the city:
- Ukrainian TB-2 drones have been very busy and losses have apparently been limited, which is quite astonishing:
- More types of RPGs for Ukraine:
- Russia's artillery forces have been very busy, laying waste to large areas. The multiple-launch rocket system barrages have been especially horrific and costly on civilian populations:
- Russia is targeting fuel and oil reserves around Kyiv, with another strike on the fuel farm at Vasylkiv Air Base and one on Hostomel Air Base:
- The world's most incredible sailing yacht, one of the fleet of oligarch-owned luxury vessels that are being hunted down around the globe, has been seized by Italian police:
- The U.S. still says Ukraine's air defenses remain remarkably intact despite Russian attempts to neuter them:
- Ukrainian civilians are coming out in force to face their Russian occupiers:
- More Russian combat aircraft losses:
- Ukraine is now putting more organization into the captured vehicles under their control and reconstituting some of them, including tanks and APCs, for the war effort:
- We will continue to update this post until it's noted otherwise.

- Speculation that Russia may be using a new form of weapon nicknamed 'suicide drones' has sparked concern over the role Artificial Intelligence (AI) could be set to play in modern warfare.
- In recent weeks photographs have emerged that appear to show Russian KUB-BLA drones shot down by Ukrainian forces. Known as 'loitering munitions,' these are small drones that are fired from a portable launch tube, and intentionally crash into their target detonating an explosive.
- Measuring just 1.2 meters, the jet-style drones can travel up to 120 kilometres in 30 minutes, and, crucially, are said by their manufacturer to be equipped with an AI system capable of 'intelligent detection and recognition of objects by class and type in real time.'
- First recorded use of loitering munition by Russian force: KUB-BLA loitering munition in Podil, Kyiv pic.twitter.com/b8pQQklOGM
- Experts in weapons technology say the possibility that the KUB-BLA's AI system could be being used in an active warzone raises concerning questions about the extent to which decision-making in war could be increasingly handed off to unmanned, or autonomous systems.
- "The notion of a killer robot—where you have artificial intelligence fused with weapons—that technology is here, and it's being used," Zachary Kallenborn, a research affiliate with the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), told WIRED.
- Experts have stressed that it's not clear whether Russia is employing the autonomous capabilities of its drones in Ukraine, but their availability suggests we may be moving closer to a scenario where machines used in war are given the authority to choose what targets to destroy, and even which people to kill.
- Russia isn't the only country developing this kind of technology, in fact earlier this week the US confirmed it was sending Ukraine its own 'suicide drones,' albeit versions which require human input to locate and engage targets.
- The US says that drones with autonomous capabilities should always require human confirmation when lethal force is involved, but does not oppose an overall ban on the development of the technology.
- Yet while the idea of AI weapons sounds scary, one researcher has questioned how effective they would be if used in Ukraine.
- "The Russian military and its capabilities are now being severely tested in Ukraine," Russian military expert Samuel Bendett told WIRED. "If the [human] ground forces with all their sophisticated information gathering can't really make sense of what's happening on the ground, then how could a drone?"

- Felix Woessner tweeted that Russia apparently uses Zala Aero Cube (Kub) loitering munitions – or kamikaze drones – in Ukraine. Russia already used Kub drones in Syria from 2015.Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link
- Russian Kub loitering munition (suicide drone) recuperated by the Ukrainian forces (Picture source: Twitter account of Felix Woessner)
- Kub-E loitering munition, an upgraded variant of the original Kub, was developed by Zala Aero (part of the Kalashnikov group of companies) and it successfully passed state tests in November 2021. On December 21, 2021, Army Recognition already reported that serial supplies of the new KUB-BLA loitering drone developed by Zala Aero (part of the Kalashnikov Group) could begin in 2022, which appears now confirmed. The company’s press office said then: “The new strike drone has been recommended for acceptance into service. The serial supplies are expected to begin in 2022”.
- According to the developer, the UAV has high accuracy, can be covertly launched, it is virtually silent and easy to operate. “This system represents a step to completely new conduct of operations”, said Rostec’s CEO Sergey Chemezov at IDEX 2019, when the Kub-BLA was unveiled. “The high-precision drone comes within 30 minutes at a speed of 130 km/h. The shell is delivered to the target by the complex regardless of terrain or whether the target is concealed or not, both at low and high attitudes It is an extremely accurate and efficient weapon being very hard to combat by traditional air defense systems.”
- According to the press office, the Kub-BLA is multipurpose and can be used as part of a swarm of drones. It can reach 80 to 130 km/h. Its flight duration is 30 minutes and its maximum payload is 3 kg. After the launch, the drone can loiter in the air to detect a target and then attack it from the upper hemisphere, being able to perform a diving pass along the vertical trajectory. This allows it to attack tanks in the field from the upper hemisphere, piercing the turret that has minimal armor protection in the upper part.
- "Due to their wide-area effects, the use of cluster munitions in populated areas is incompatible with the international humanitarian law principles governing the conduct of hostilities", UN spokesperson Liz Throssell told Geneva-based journalists (Picture source: Twitter account of Felix Woessner)
