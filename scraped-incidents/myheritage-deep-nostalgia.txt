- Genealogy company MyHeritage has launched 'Deep Nostalgia', an AI system that enables users to aminate a person in a photograph.
- Developed with Israeli AI firm D-ID, Deep Nostalgia uses artifical intellligence to animate images so that they smile, wink, nod, and move their heads from side to side.
- Reaction to the tool has been mixed. Some describe the results as 'amazing' and 'emotional', while others see it as 'spooky', 'creepy' and 'unethical'. Photographs of both deceased and living people can be animated using Deep Nostalgia.
- MyHeritage told the BBC that it did not include speech 'in order to prevent abuse, such as the creation of deepfake videos of living people'.
- In March 2022, MyHeritage introduced LiveStory, which enables users to animate their creations through vocal storytelling by using deep learning algorithms that draw on a custom set of over 140 voices in 31 languages.

- Genealogy site MyHeritage has introduced a tool which uses deepfake technology to animate the faces in photographs of dead relatives.
- Called DeepNostalgia, the firm acknowledged that some people might find the feature "creepy" while others would consider it "magical".
- It said it did not include speech to avoid the creation of "deepfake people".
- It comes as the UK government considers legislation on deepfake technology.
- The Law Commission is considering proposals to make it illegal to created deepfake videos without consent.
- MyHeritage said that it had deliberately not included speech in the feature "in order to prevent abuse, such as the creation of deepfake videos of living people".
- "This feature is intended for nostalgic use, that is, to bring beloved ancestors back to life," it wrote in its FAQs about the new technology.
- But it also acknowledged that "some people love the Deep Nostalgia feature and consider it magical, while others find it creepy and dislike it".
- "The results can be controversial, and it's hard to stay indifferent to this technology."
- Deepfakes are computer-generated AI-driven videos that can be created from existing photos.
- The technology behind Deep Nostalgia was developed by Israeli firm D-ID. It used artificial intelligence and trained its algorithms on pre-recorded videos of living people moving their faces and gesturing.
- On the MyHeritage site, historical figures such as Queen Victoria and Florence Nightingale are reanimated. And earlier this month, to mark his birthday, the firm put a video of Abraham Lincoln on YouTube using the technology.
- The former US president appears in colour and is shown speaking.
- People have begun posting their own reanimated ancestor videos on Twitter, with mixed responses. Some described the results as "amazing" and "emotional" while others expressed concern.
- In December, Channel 4 created a deepfake Queen who delivered an alternative Christmas message, as part of a warning about how the technology could be used to spread fake news.

- Feb 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Like the animated paintings that adorn the walls of Harry Potter's school, a new online tool promises to bring portraits of dead relatives to life, stirring debate about the use of technology to impersonate people.
- Genealogy company MyHeritage launched its "Deep Nostalgia" feature earlier this week, allowing users to turn stills into short videos showing the person in the photograph smiling, winking and nodding.
- "Seeing our beloved ancestors' faces come to life ... lets us imagine how they might have been in reality, and provides a profound new way of connecting to our family history," MyHeritage founder Gilad Japhet said in a statement.
- Developed with Israeli computer vision firm D-ID, Deep Nostalgia uses deep learning algorithms to animate images with facial expressions that were based on those of MyHeritage employees.
- Some of the company's users took to Twitter on Friday to share the animated images of their deceased relatives, as well as moving depictions of historical figures, including Albert Einstein and Ancient Egypt's lost Queen Nefertiti.
- "Takes my breath away. This is my grandfather who died when I was eight. @MyHeritage brought him back to life. Absolutely crazy," wrote Twitter user Jenny Hawran.
- While most expressed amazement, others described the feature as "spooky" and said it raised ethical questions. "The photos are enough. The dead have no say in this," tweeted user Erica Cervini.
- From chatbots to virtual reality, the tool is the latest innovation seeking to bring the dead to life through technology.
- Last year U.S. rapper Kanye West famously gifted his wife Kim Kardashian a hologram of her late father congratulating her on her birthday and on marrying "the most, most, most, most, most genius man in the whole world".
- 
- 'ANIMATING THE PAST'
- The trend has opened up all sorts of ethical and legal questions, particularly around consent and the opportunity to blur reality by recreating a virtual doppelganger of the living.
- Elaine Kasket a psychology professor at the University of Wolverhampton in Britain who authored a book on the "digital afterlife", said that while Deep Nostalgia was not necessarily "problematic", it sat "at the top of a slippery slope".
- "When people start overwriting history or sort of animating the past ... You wonder where that ends up," she said.
- MyHeritage acknowledges on its website that the technology can be "a bit uncanny" and its use "controversial", but said steps have been taken to prevent abuses.
- "The Deep Nostalgia feature includes hard-coded animations that are intentionally without any speech and therefore cannot be used to fake any content or deliver any message," MyHeritage public relations director Rafi Mendelsohn said in a statement.
- Yet, images alone can convey meaning, said Faheem Hussain, a clinical assistant professor at Arizona State University's School for the Future of Innovation in Society.
- "Imagine somebody took a picture of the Last Supper and Judas is now winking at Mary Magdalene - what kind of implications that can have," Hussain told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.
- Similarly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) animations could be use to make someone appear as though they were doing things they might not be happy about, such as rolling their eyes or smiling at a funeral, he added.
- Mendelsohn of MyHeritage said using photos of a living person without their consent was a breach of the company's terms and conditions, adding that videos were clearly marked with AI symbols to differentiate them from authentic recordings.
- "It is our ethical responsibility to mark such synthetic videos clearly and differentiate them from real videos," he said.

- Genealogy website MyHeritage has unveiled a bizarre new online tool that can animate old photos of deceased family members.
- The free deepfake technology, called Deep Nostalgia, takes any photo and animates the subject's face – with strangely realistic and unsettling results.
- Examples provided by MyHeritage show historical figures, including Queen Victoria, Mark Twain and Florence Nightingale, come to life.
- MyHeritage says the tech gives history 'a fresh new perspective' by producing a depiction of how a person 'could have moved and looked if captured on video'.
- It's been developed by researchers at Israel-based firm D-ID, which specialises in video reenactment using deep learning.
- Anyone can use the tool on the Deep Nostalgia webpage by uploading or drag-and-dropping an image – although to see the results you'll need a MyHeritage account.
- Scroll down for video
- Examples provided by MyHeritage show historical figures, including Queen Victoria, Mark Twain and Florence Nightingale, come to life. The tech uses a modern-day input to animate photos of the deceased
- Deepfakes are so named because they are made using deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence, to create fake videos of a target individual.
- They are made by feeding a computer an algorithm, or set of instructions, as well as lots of images and audio of the target person.
- The computer program then learns how to mimic the person's facial expressions, mannerisms, voice and inflections.
- With enough video and audio of someone, you can combine a fake video of a person with fake audio and get them to say anything you want.
- 'You'll have a 'wow moment' when you see a treasured family photo come to life with Deep Nostalgia,' said Gilad Japhet, founder and CEO of MyHeritage.
- 'Seeing our beloved ancestors' faces come to life in a video simulation lets us imagine how they might have been in reality, and provides a profound new way of connecting to our family history.'
- Deep Nostalgia uses several pre-recorded 'driver videos' – normal videos of living people performing simple gestures and face movements.
- These driver videos direct the movements of the photos.
- Each time someone uploads an old photo, a preferred driver is automatically selected for each face based on its orientation and then seamlessly applied to the photo.
- The result is a short but high-quality video animation of an individual face that can smile, blink and move.
- Photos are also enhanced prior to animation using the MyHeritage Photo Enhancer, which brings blurry and low-resolution faces into focus and increases their resolution.
- Deep Nostalgia is the newest AI-based photo tool on MyHeritage, the Israeli genealogy platform that launched in 2003 and has soared in popularity since.
- MyHeritage is well known for web services and products such as saliva-based DNA testing kits that claim to reveal 'the ethnic groups and geographic regions you originate from'.
- Deep Nostalgia makes use of a selection of modern day videos to animate an old photo. It automatically picks the best input video based on head shape and size
- Last year, the firm released both the MyHeritage Photo Enhancer and MyHeritage In Color, which colourises black and white and faded colour photos.
- These features have gone viral and have been used over 30 million times, according to the firm.
- Deep Nostalgia is a freemium feature – meaning several additional features come with a price.
- Users can animate several photos for free, regardless of the number of faces in the photo but 'continued use requires a subscription'.
- The video animation can easily be shared with family and friends on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and other social media.
- 'This new product integration is an exciting collaboration between two innovative companies,' said Gil Perry, co-founder and CEO of D-ID.
- 'We're thrilled that our technology will be accessible to millions of people on MyHeritage and hope many of them will enjoy the impact of video reenactment for historical photos.'
- Deepfake technology isn't without its controversies, however – a growing cause of concern is their ability to contribute to the spread of fake news, misplaced identity and even fraud.
- Some hyper-realistic videos depicts a person appears to say or do something they did not, fuelling the spread of misinformation and deceit.
- Deepfake technology entered even murkier waters last year, when it emerged that photos shared by girls on their social media were being faked to appear nude by a deepfake bot on messaging app Telegram.
- Disturbing deepfake tool on popular messaging app Telegram was found to forge nude images of underage girls from clothed photos on their social media
- More than 100,000 non-consensual sexual images of 10,000 women and girls were shared online that were created using the bot between July 2019 and 2020, according to a report from deepfake detection firm Sensity.
- More recently, Channel 4 broadcast a deepfake version of the Queen's speech for its annual 2020 Alternative Christmas Message.
- Ofcom decided not to investigate the 354 complaints it received about the video, which depicts 'Deepfake Queen' dancing on top of her desk and making jokes about toilet roll shortages due to Covid.
- Back in December 2017, it was discovered that Reddit users were creating fake pornography using celebrity faces pasted on to adult film actresses' bodies.
- The disturbing videos, created by Reddit user deepfakes, look strikingly real as a result of a sophisticated machine learning algorithm, which uses photographs to create human masks that are then overlaid on top of adult film footage.
- Now, AI-assisted porn is spreading all over Reddit, thanks to an easy-to-use app that can be downloaded directly to your desktop computer, according to Motherboard.
- The video, created by Reddit user deepfakes, features a woman who takes on the rough likeness of Gadot, with the actor’s face overlaid on another person’s head. A clip from the video is shown
- To create the likeness of Gal Gadot, for example, the algorithm was trained on real porn videos and images of actor, allowing it to create an approximation of the actor’s face that can be applied to the moving figure in the video.
- As all of this is freely available information, it could be done without that person's consent.
- And, as Motherboard notes, people today are constantly uploading photos of themselves to various social media platforms, meaning someone could use such a technique to harass someone they know.

- The genealogy site MyHeritage debuted a new AI tool capable of turning photos of deceased relatives into unnerving videos.
- Called DeepNostalgia, the new feature uses tech developed by an Israeli tech firm called D-ID. According to MyHeritage, several drivers work together to animate the faces.
- "Each driver is a video consisting of a fixed sequence of movements and gestures. Deep Nostalgia can very accurately apply the drivers to a face in your still photo, creating a short video that you can share with your friends and family. The driver guides the movements in the animation so you can see your ancestors smile, blink, and turn their heads."
- With our new Deep Nostalgia™, you can see how a person from an old photo could have moved and looked if they were captured on video! Read more: https://t.co/ZwUwzJRQ26 #RootsTech #RootsTechConnect pic.twitter.com/LERXhrqiut
- While it's tempting to upload images of deceased relatives or long-lost friends, it's an uncomfortable proposition to digitally resurrect or reanimate a person's face without their consent.
- MyHeritage has said the DeepNostalgia tool doesn't create speech — to stop people from creating actionable deepfake videos. But the company has created a voice for a reanimated Abraham Lincoln, used as a promotional video.
- 
- However, even if MyHeritage's new feature could create speech for people in photos, it would not reflect the personality of the real person. AI imitating real humans is no better than an impersonation of that person. No matter how skilled the impersonator, it can never really be the real deal.
- "This feature is intended for nostalgic use, that is, to bring beloved ancestors back to life," said MyHeritage in its FAQs about the new feature. But the company also admitted that "some people love the Deep Nostalgia feature and consider it magical, while others find it creepy and dislike it."
- "The results can be controversial, and it's hard to stay indifferent to this technology."
- Deepfake models are computer-generated and AI-driven videos capable of simulating the animation of real people from an existing photo.
- On MyHeritage's site, historical figures like Florence Nightingale and Queen Victoria are reanimated for all to view. But people have already started posting pics of their reanimated ancestor videos on Twitter, to mixed reactions. Some said the results were "amazing" and "emotional," but others weren't so thrilled.
- Beyond the issues of creepiness and basic ethics of creating videos of other people without their consent, there are also political issues. In December, the U.K.'s Channel 4 generated a deepfake Queen who gave an alternative Christmas message — as a performative warning to the public on how deepfake technology might be used to spread fake news.
- However satisfying the nostalgic experience for users of this new feature, there is growing concern about the potential misapplication of deepfakes for unfriendly ends.

- MyHeritage, a company for "discovering family history" — as they describe themselves — has released "Deep Nostalgia", which uses AI to animate photos. Upload a picture, and the AI produces a gif that smiles, blinks, and moves its eyes around.
- It's based on tech by D-ID, and yowsa is it ever unsettling!
- I'm certain that some people will an animated photo of their grandfather heartwarming. Personally, I find it both a) technologically super intriguing and b) skin-crawlingly weird. Even MyHeritage itself notes, in its FAQ, that one's mileage may vary on this one …
- This technology is fascinating but a bit uncanny, don't you think?
- Some people love the Deep Nostalgia™ feature and consider it magical, while others find it creepy and dislike it. Indeed, the results can be controversial and it's hard to stay indifferent to this technology. We invite you to create videos using this feature and share them on social media to see what your friends and family think. This feature is intended for nostalgic use, that is, to bring beloved ancestors back to life. Our driver videos don't include speech in order to prevent abuse of this , such as the creation of "deep fake" vi deos of living people. Please use this feature on your own historical photos and not on photos featuring living people without their permission.
- MyHeritage markets this as a way to animate old family photos, but as I understand it, there's nothing stopping anyone from using it to animate a newer photo. So: How's this gonna be used to troll and abuse people? It'll happen, though precisely what forms it'll take I can't yet hazard.

- A new deepfake technology unveiled by MyHeritage can animate old photos of deceased family members. This technology is called Deep Nostalgia that makes faces in old photos move in strangely realistic and unsettling results.
- Some examples of this free deepfake technology show historical figures, such as Queen Victoria, Mark Twain, and Florence Nightingale, come to life.
- MyHeritage said that this deepfake technology gives history a fresh perspective of how historical figures or our ancestors were like when they were alive. It depicts how a person would have been if captured on video, USA Today reported.
- Deep Nostalgia has been developed by Israel-based firm D-ID that specializes in video reenactment using deep learning technology.
- Deep Nostalgia is a free tool; visit their webpage and upload or drag and drop an image to see the still photo come to life. But the results will only be seen in a MyHeritage account.
- MyHeritage is a leading global company that specializes in discovering the past and empowering the future, according to Business Wire. The company unveiled Deep Nostalgia that uses deep fake technology to animate faces in still photos.
- MyHeritage offers the complete package of restoring, colonizing, enhancing, and now animating old photos, making them the only company to do so.
- Deep Nostalgia is the last addition to MyHeritage's technology and the newest AI-based photo tool that comes on the heels of two highly-acclaimed features that the company offered in 2020.
- Last year, MyHeritage unveiled their Photo Enhancer and MyHeritage in Color that puts color to old black and whiter photos and recently upgraded to restore the colors in faded photos.
- The company continues to develop new technologies by adding novel, cutting-edge tools for historical or old photos that inspire an appreciation for family heritage and nostalgic family photos.
- "You'll have a 'wow moment' when you see a treasured family photo come to life with Deep Nostalgia," said MyHeritage Founder and CEO Gilad Japhet.
- He added that through their technology, people could have the chance of seeing the face in old photographs come to life and imagine how they were in real life.

- 
- According to MailOnline, Deep Nostalgia uses several pre-recorded "driver videos" or the normal videos of living people performing simple gestures and facial movements. These videos direct the movements of the animated old photos.
- Whenever a photo is uploaded to Deep Nostalgia's website, a preferred driver is automatically selected for each face depending on the orientation and then seamlessly applies to the uploaded photo.
- Moreover, Deep Nostalgia enhances the photo before it is animated using MyHeritage Photo Enhancer to bring the blurry and low-quality photos into focus and increase the resolutions.
- As a result, the uploader can now have a short, but high-quality video animation of a person that smiles, blink and move.

- AI-enabled synthetic media is being used as a tool for manipulating real emotions and capturing user data by genealogy service MyHeritage, which has just launched a new feature — called “deep nostalgia” — that lets users upload a photo of a person (or several people) to see individual faces animated by algorithm.
- The Black Mirror-style pull of seeing long-lost relatives — or famous people from another era — brought to a synthetic approximation of life, eyes swivelling, faces tilting as if they’re wondering why they’re stuck inside this useless digital photo frame, has led to an inexorable stream of social shares since it was unveiled yesterday at a family history conference…

- MyHeritage’s AI-powered viral marketing playbook with this deepfakery isn’t a complicated one: They’re going straight for tugging on your heart strings to grab data that can be used to drive sign-ups for their other (paid) services. (Selling DNA tests is their main business.)
- It’s free to animate a photo using the “deep nostalgia” tech on MyHeritage’s site, but you don’t get to see the result until you hand over at least an email (along with the photos you want animated, ofc) — and agree to its T&Cs and privacy policy. Both of which have attracted a number of concerns over the years.
- Last year, for example, the Norwegian Consumer Council reported MyHeritage to the national consumer protection and data authorities after a legal assessment of the T&Cs found the contract it asks customers to sign to be “incomprehensible”.
- In 2018 MyHeritage also suffered a major data breach — and data from that breach was later found for sale on the dark web, among a wider cache of hacked account info pertaining to several other services.
- MyHeritage breach exposes 92M emails and hashed passwords
- 
- The company — which, as we reported earlier this week, is being acquired by a U.S. private equity firm for ~$600 million — is doubtless relying on the deep pull of nostalgia to smooth over any individual misgivings about handing over data and agreeing to its terms.
- Unlimited access to MyHeritage’s ‘deep nostalgia’ feature — plus a bundle of other services such as photo enhancement — also carries a monthly fee (though your first few nostalgia hits are free).
- The face animation technology itself is impressive enough — if you set aside the ethics of encouraging people to drag their long-lost relatives into the uncanny valley to help MyHeritage cross-sell DNA testing (with all the massive privacy considerations around putting that kind of data in the hands of a commercial entity).
- Looking at the inquisitive face of my great-grandmother I do have to wonder what she would have made of all this?
- The facial animation feature is powered by Israeli company D-ID, a TechCrunch Disrupt battlefield alum — which started out building tech to digitally de-identify faces with an eye on protecting images and video from being identifiable by facial recognition algorithms.
- It released a demo video of the newer, photo-animating technology last year. The tech uses a driver video to animate the photo — mapping facial features from the photo onto that base driver to create a “live portrait”, as D-ID calls it.
- “The Live Portrait solution brings still photos to life. The photo is mapped and then animated by a driver video, causing the subject to move its head and facial features, mimicking the motions of the driver video,” D-ID said in a press release. “This technology can be implemented by historical organizations, museums, and educational programs to animate well-known figures.”
- It’s offering live portraits as part of a wider “AI Face” platform, which will offer third parties access to other deep learning, computer vision and image processing technologies. D-ID bills the platform as a “one-stop shop” for synthesized video creation.
- Other tools include a “face anonymization” feature, which replaces one person’s face on video with another’s (such as for documentary film makers to protect a whistleblower’s identity); and a “talking heads” feature that can be used for lip syncing or to replace the need to pay actors to appear in content such as marketing videos as it can turn an audio track into a video of a person appearing to speak those words.
- The age of synthesized media is going to be a weird one, that’s for sure.

- Genealogy company MyHeritage is putting deepfake technology to a creatively unsettling use with a new feature called Deep Nostalgia. The system animates photographs of long-deceased loved ones, turning old still portraits into uncanny blinking and smiling videos.
- Deepfake technology has been rapidly evolving over the past few years and generally stoking conversations over how close we are to completely losing faith in the veracity of the images we encounter. So far, the technology is still in its infancy but MyHeritage is presenting a novel use of deepfakes, bringing to life still photographs of dead relatives.
- Called Deep Nostalgia, the technology comes from Israel-based company D-ID. Users can upload old photographs of deceased relatives and the system automatically enhances the image before applying a deepfake algorithm to deliver a short animated video of the subject.
- Within seconds a user is greeted with their ancestor smiling, blinking and moving their head. Several combinations of gestures can be selected by the user and multiple faces can be animated in the same photograph.
- MyHeritage seems aware of the unsettling nature of the technology and openly admits Deep Nostalgia may not be for everyone. The company also notes it will not add speech features to its system to avoid the technology being abused by those wanting to easily create deepfake videos of living people.
- "While many love the Deep Nostalgia feature and consider it magical, others find it uncanny and are uncomfortable with the results,” the company writes on its webpage. “Our driver videos don’t include speech in order to prevent abuse of this feature, such as the creation of 'deep fake' videos of living people. Please use this feature on your own historical photos, and not on photos featuring living people without their permission.”

- The company says in the first 48 hours of offering the new feature more than one million photographs were animated. A blog post collecting a number of user experiences revealed many found the system “heartwarming” and “incredible”.
- For those wanting to experiment with what it feels like seeing deceased relatives come back to life and smile, MyHeritage offers a limited amount of watermarked animations for free, while broader access to the feature of course comes at a price.

- The unique use of deepfakes is undoubtedly a portent of things to come as this technology inevitably gets better and better. While most conversation around deepfakes has centered on either political or pornographic uses, it is not difficult to imagine a future where there are services offering bereaved individuals full video interactions with deceased loved ones.

- An AI-powered service called Deep Nostalgia that animates still photos has become the main character on Twitter this fine Sunday, as people try to create the creepiest fake “video” possible, apparently.
- The Deep Nostalgia service, offered by online genealogy company MyHeritage, uses AI licensed from D-ID to create the effect that a still photo is moving. It’s kinda like the iOS Live Photos feature, which adds a few seconds of video to help smartphone photographers find the best shot.
- But Deep Nostalgia can take photos from any camera and bring them to “life.” The program uses pre-recorded driver videos of facial movements and applies the one that works best for the still photo in question. Its intended purpose is to allow you to upload photos of deceased loved ones and see them in “action,” which seems like a lovely idea.
- Users have to sign up for a free account on MyHeritage and then upload a photo. From there the process is automated; the site enhances the image before animating it and creating a gif. The site’s FAQ says it does not provide the photos to any third parties, and on its main page a message reads “photos uploaded without completing signup are automatically deleted to protect your privacy.”
- Naturally, the program has become something of a meme-generator on Twitter, with users trying to push the AI to its limit. An archaeologist used photos of ancient statues, and yes they included some with the blank eyes. Sorry in advance for the nightmare fuel (but hiiii there Alexander the Great):
- Deep Nostalgia can only handle single headshots and can only animate faces, so you’re not going to be able to reanimate mummies to make it look like they’re walking (hey I wondered, OK?). You can upload five photos for free to the MyHeritage website for Deep Nostalgia treatment, after that you have to register for a paid account.
- I wonder if perhaps there are some photos best left un-animated? I’m wary of uploading photos to any site, and I think the usual privacy cautions still apply. But if you’re going to try Deep Nostalgia brace yourself for a surreal experience. The AI is scarily good.

- The genealogy service is using artificial intelligence-powered tools as a marketing campaign to drum up new subscribers.
- Nostalgia sells and marketers know it. People like to fantasize about a past they think was better than it likely was — and wonder what it might have been like for their relatives who lived through it. To capitalize on this, a genealogy-tracking service called MyHeritage has launched an AI-powered tool it calls Deep Nostalgia which animates old photos of users' family members, whether deceased or otherwise.
- Several users of the service have taken to Twitter to share animated images of their great grandparents, reanimated, and exhibiting various facial expressions. The style of each video is almost the same: the subject moves their eyes around and then tilts their head a little, as if trying to recall something in answer to a question, before returning their gaze to the viewer. But then, it's early days for the service, and odds are it'll get a lot more flexible eventually.
- Check out this example found on Twitter below:
- Mostly an ad and a fad? — We'd never dissuade people from exploring their ancestry or heritage, but this particular tool from MyHeritage seems like little more than a marketing project... much like its previous attempt at virality where it used AI to enhance the quality of old family photos.
- MyHeritage asks for heaps of data from users, which can later be used to try and upsell customers on paid services. There are also legitimate concerns around its use and protection of users' DNA. The criticism applies to other industry giants like Ancestry, 23andMe, and FamilyTreeDNA, too, all of which that promise to deliver a wealth of information about your roots in exchange for your privacy. Sensitive information like user DNA is then stored in massive databases that may be sold to med-tech firms... or which could be compromised via hacks.
- "Free" — While reanimating old photos is novel, and using the service is ostensibly free, we can't help but feel that seeing meemaw as an animated deepfake may not be worth assenting to MyHeritage's privacy policy and terms of service, because who knows where these images might end up. And also, if meemaw has shuffled off this mortal coil, we can't exactly get her to consent.

- Almost like animated, moving portraits in the Harry Potter franchise, photos once frozen in time are being brought to life with an artificial intelligence (A.I.) program called Deep Nostalgia.
- The technology, which was released on February 25 by the genealogy website MyHeritage, has since gone viral. Social media users have created lifelike moving portraits of mathematician Alan Turing, abolitionist Frederick Douglass and physicist Marie Curie, reports Mindy Weisberger for Live Science. The historical figures can blink, move their heads side-to-side, and even smile. The tech is also being used to animate artwork, statues and photos of ancestors.
- A.I. can create video footage or "deepfakes" using generative adversarial networks or GANs, Live Science reports. A GAN is composed of two A.I. systems working together to create content that appears eerily similar to the real thing. One system, the generator, creates a copy of an image using new data. Another system, the discriminator, determines if the data passes as real or fake. Over time, both tools will learn to create incredibly lifelike images that are difficult to distinguish from the originals, as reported by Adam Mann for Live Science in 2019.
- MyHeritage introduced Deep Nostalgia to allow users to see their ancestors or late relatives in motion. To create lifelike movements, the facial recognition company D-ID, which specializes in deep learning technology, uses GANs to animate the uploaded images. Footage of real people displaying different facial movements were used to train Deep Nostalgia's algorithm to apply motion to still photos, reports Ed Browne for Newsweek.
- The algorithm can recognize which pre-recorded video best fits with the photo depending on the subject's pose and applies natural facial movements to images that didn't previously move, reports Kim Lyons for Verge.
- "Seeing our beloved ancestors' faces come to life in a video simulation lets us imagine how they might have been in reality, and provides a profound new way of connecting to our family history," Gilad Japhet, CEO and founder of MyHeritage, tells USA Today's Coral Murphy Marcos.
- Deep fakes have drawn controversy in recent years for their uncanny ability to create alterred videos or images of political figures and celebrities that can't be distinguished from the real thing. Deep fakes can be used for malicious purposes, such as splicing words into someone's speech, making it appear that they are saying something they never said. In other instances, the faces of Hollywood celebrities were edited onto the bodies of actresses in pornographic videos, reports AJ Willingham for CNN.
- Other critics note that historical figures were often very intentional about their posture and expression in photos, like Frederick Douglass, who has been called "the most photographed American of the 19th century." He purposely chose photography as a medium for changing how the world viewed black men at the time. Images of black people existed, but often in subservient, violent or compromised positions in the context of slavery. In the 2015 book Picturing Frederick Douglass, Harvard historian John Stauffer explains that Douglass, as a former enslaved individual, believed photography "highlighted the essential humanity of its subjects," reported Renee Graham for WBUR in 2016. Using Deep Nostaligia to make Douglass move and emote changes the radical message he was trying to convey.
- "Douglass specifically—in print, he said that he did not want—he did not want to be portrayed as a happy slave," Stauffer told NPR in 2015. "The smiling black was to play into the racist caricature. And his cause of ending slavery and ending racism had the gravity that required a stern look. And so he tended to confront the viewer, look directly into the camera."
- By March 4, the website already had ten million photos uploaded and animated, Newsweek reports.
- "Indeed, the results can be controversial, and it's hard to stay indifferent to this technology. This feature is intended for nostalgic use, that is, to bring beloved ancestors back to life. Our driver videos don't include speech in order to prevent abuse of this, such as the creation of 'deep fake' videos of living people," MyHeritage states.

- Early last year, MyHeritage made use of deepfake technology to bring old photos of deceased loved ones to life. Deep Nostalgia went viral and more than 100 million animations have since been created. Now the genealogy company is back with LiveStory, which adds vocal storytelling to the mix.
- "LiveStory takes storytelling to the next level," said MyHeritage founder and CEO, Gilad Japhet. "With this latest viral feature, MyHeritage continues to lead the world of online family history in both vision and innovation. Our use of AI to breathe new life into historical photos is unique and is helping millions of people cultivate a renewed emotional connection with their ancestors and deceased loved ones. Genealogy is all about telling and preserving our family stories. We keep showing the world how fun and compelling genealogy can be."
- As with Deep Nostalgia – where users could upload a still photograph and have it turned into a short animation by deep learning algorithms – MyHeritage has joined forces with Israel's D-ID to have a speaking portrait of a relative narrate their life story.
- Of course, the accompanying audio track won't be in the actual voice of your ancestor or relative, but the service offers more than 140 voices in 31 languages to choose from. MyHeritage hopes to add custom voice samples as a feature at some point in the future.
- The life events highlighted in the video biography can be automatically generated from information contained in the user's family tree on MyHeritage, or via text in the first person entered manually as brief sections called chapters along with additional images to help tell the story.
- The tool then stitches together images, converts the biography text to speech and then applies video reenactment technology to animate and lip sync the ancestor's face and mouth to add a voice to the story. This part of the process can take anything from around 30 seconds to several minutes, depending on the length of the narrative.
- LiveStory is reported to work just as well on black-and-white photos as color or colorized ones, and the resulting video can be played as is or edited further, and then shared with friends and family.
- The feature is expected to be improved over time, and future updates currently in the pipe include adding subtitles, drag and drop reordering of chapters and a photo picker to make image selection easier.
- LiveStory is offered as a fremium feature, which means that users can create a few biography videos without cost online or through the mobile app. Beyond that, folks will have to pay a subscription fee. The tool is introduced in the video below.
