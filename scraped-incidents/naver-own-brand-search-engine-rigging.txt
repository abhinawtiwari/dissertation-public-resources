- Naver (Hangul: 네이버) is a South Korean online platform operated by the Naver Corporation. It was launched in 1999 as the first web portal in South Korea to develop and use its own search engine. It was also the world's first operator to introduce the comprehensive search feature, which compiles search results from various categories and presents them in a single page. Naver has since added a multitude of new services ranging from basic features such as e-mail and news to the world's first online Q&A platform Knowledge iN.
- As of September 2017, the search engine handled 74.7% of all web searches in South Korea and had 42 million enrolled users. More than 25 million Koreans have Naver as the start page on their default browser and the mobile application has 28 million daily visitors.[citation needed] Naver has also been referred to as 'the Google of South Korea'.[2]
- Owing to its rising popularity in Japan, Naver is now competing with Kakao to claim the number one position in Japanese market of web novel and web comic.[3]
- Naver was created in June 1999 as the first South Korean portal website with a self-developed search engine. In August 2000, Naver began the 'comprehensive search' service, which allows users to get a variety of results from a search query on a single page, organized by type, including blogs, websites, images, web communities, etc. This was five years before Google launched a similar offer with its 'universal search' function.
- In the early days of Naver's operation, there was a relative dearth of web pages available in the Korean language. To fill this void, Naver became an early pioneer in user-generated content through the creation of the 'Knowledge iN (Hangul: 네이버 지식인)' service in 2002. In Knowledge iN, users can pose questions on any subject and select among answers provided by other users, awarding points to the users who gives the best answers. Knowledge iN was launched three years before Yahoo! launched its similar 'Yahoo! Answers' service,[4] and now possesses a database of over 200 million answers.
- Over the years, Naver has continued to expand its services. It launched its Web comic service 'Webtoon' in 2004 and its personal Blog service in 2005. From 2005 to 2007, Naver expanded its multimedia search services, including music and video search as well as mobile search.
- In 2019, Naver reorganized its mobile version of the main screen, excluding search windows and some menus. In response more than 3,000 comments opposing the change have been posted.[5]
- Naver introduced new restrictions on comments to protect celebrities from malicious comments by anonymous online audiences in March, 2020. This followed a 2019 incident where a famous singer-actress Sulli committed suicide due to depression after facing a huge amount of malicious comments.[6] Naver also replaced the comment box with facial emojis after criticisms of mental health implications for celebrities.
- As of January 19, 2020, Naver now owns Wattpad, an online book service.
- In October 2020, Naver was fined 26.7 billion won ($22.9 million) by South Korea's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) for manipulating its algorithm between 2012 and 2015 in favor of its own services such as Smart Store and Naver TV over services provided by rivals.[7][8] Naver's share in the open market sector increased from 4.97% in 2015 to 21.08% in 2018, while competitors' market shares went down.[9][10]

- For two weeks from May 1, 2021, Naver held an event to pay up to 16,000 won to people who posted on Naver blog every day. However, this event was ended early due to a number of incidents where people with multiple IDs. Most people who participated in the event criticized Naver's response.[12]
- Naver announced on its official blog that it would resume its "Today's Diary Challenge (Korean: #오늘일기챌린지)" event, which ended early in three days, from May 24. However, only those who participated in the previously discontinued event (who completed the three-day record) can participate in the event.[13]
- Naver announced on May 13, 2021, that it would show profile pictures as well if it posts comments on Naver news articles. Previously, it was difficult to recognize users because only four digits in front of the author's ID who commented on Naver news articles were disclosed. Naver expected that it would be easier to recognize users and solve the problem of malicious comments by implementing such services. Critics criticized the company for its censorship of comments.[14]

- Knowledge iN (Hangul: 지식iN), formerly Knowledge Search (Korean:지식검색), is an online Q&A platform launched in October 2002.[15] The tool allows users to ask any question and to receive answers from other users. Knowledge iN was an early example of harnessing user-generated content to expand the amount of information available on the web, particularly in the Korean language. Bradley Horowitz, former Vice President of Product Strategy at Yahoo!, has cited Knowledge iN as the inspiration for Yahoo! Answers, which was launched three years after Naver introduced the original service.[16][17]
- Naver helps with unauthorized publishing in order to attract users to its Knowledge iN service. This contributes to poor quality content on Knowledge iN, as prior answers to a question are left unaltered, and old questions are only allowed small modifications by other netizens. Criticism is also growing as Naver unilaterally controls comments, and edits information that may be against its political positions.[18]
- Naver Encyclopedia (Hangul: 네이버 사전) consists of a professional database with over 3 million entries from many different encyclopedias.[19][dubious  – discuss] More than 1000 experts in physics, food, film, and other fields are producing 45 kinds of specialized content in the encyclopedia of Naver knowledge, and 50,000 headwords are accumulated.[19] The Naver Knowledge Encyclopedia also deals with more than 100 public institutions and has received over 900 kinds of DBs.[19]

- Naver's closed platform is frequently mentioned. Other search engines are not allowed to search their knowledge base and blogs, monopolizing Naver's control over its properties. In April 2011, the second and third portal sites in Korea, Daum and Nate, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to open their search for services such as cafe and blogs. Naver did not choose to participate in this MoU.[21]

- Naver fined for manipulating search algorithms
- PUBLISHED : October 06, 2020 - 16:56
- UPDATED : October 06, 2020 - 17:05
- South Korea‘s antitrust regulator on Oct. 6 imposed a 26.7 billion won ($22.9 million) fine on Naver, accusing the company of manipulating search algorithms to favor its own online shopping business. Naver, in response, said the company will appeal the accusation and the fine, a record-high amount imposed on a platform operator in South Korea. According to the Fair Trade Commission‘s announcement, Naver made changes in search algorithms to have products or services sold by those that are linked to its payment service Naver Pay have better exposure on the company’s online shopping platform. It made products sold by other online shopping competitors, such as Interpark and Gmarket, rank lower on search results, according to the FTC.

- Naver made changes to the algorithms at least six times between 2012 and 2015 to favor its own online shopping business, the FTC said in its ruling.South Korea‘s antitrust watchdog accused Naver of using the changes in its search algorithm to increase its market share. Naver‘s share in the open market sector surged to 21.08 percent in 2018 from 4.97 percent in 2015, while the shares of its competitors went down.Naver, however, argued that the antitrust watchdog is using a select few algorithmic changes to make the accusation. Naver said the company has made changes in the search algorithms around 50 times from 2010 to 2017, to improve search quality of the goods and services provided on its platform.Naver also dismissed the charges that the company have made algorithmic changes to show more search results for products provided on its platform, as well as those linked to its payment service. Meanwhile, the FTC also said it has found that Naver changed its algorithm in favor of videos linked to its video sharing platform Naver TV. By Shim Woo-hyun (ws@heraldcorp.com)

- Naver has been fined 26.7 billion won by South Korea's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) for manipulating its search algorithm to give preferential treatment to its own services and contents over rivals.
- The FTC said the search giant manipulated its algorithm six times between 2012 to 2015 to show its own services, such as Smart Store and Naver TV, at top of search results while also pushing down its competitors, such as 11th Street and Gmarket.
- These manipulations allowed Naver to increase its market share in online shopping from 2015 to 2018, the FTC said.
- During that period, Naver saw its market share jump from 5% in 2015 to 21% in 2018, while its four rivals all saw market share drops in the same time period, the commission said.
- These actions by Naver were obstructive and discriminatory against competitors and fair trade practices, the FTC said. It has ordered Naver to implement corrective measures.
- The fine is the highest to date levied against an internet service in South Korea.
- In a statement, Naver said it plans to appeal the FTC's decision, saying the outcome was regrettable and has affected the company's business activities without proper review and thought.
- According to Naver, the alterations of its algorithm had nothing to do with excluding its rivals and was done to show the best results in order to meet consumer needs. Naver said it altered its algorithm 50 times between 2010 and 2017 and said the FTC picked just some of the cases to make its case.
- In July, Naver transferred its backup data in Hong Kong from Singapore in reaction to China's introduction of new national security laws.
