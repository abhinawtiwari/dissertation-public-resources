- Customers of a real estate company in Nanning, Guangxi province in China, have had their properties sold without their knowledge by a dealer who used their facial information to access their bank details.
- The customers looking to sell their houses were instructed to verify their identities on the town's official 'Yonje Deng' app. The data was then used by an intermediary who was pretending to work at Nanning Youju Real Estate to transfer and mortgage the houses and pocket the proceeds.
- The individual was later arrested by the police, and the app updated and made more secure.
- A year later, another Nanning resident was jailed for stealing USD 23,500 from his ex-girlfriend’s bank account by unlocking her phone with her fingerprint after he had drugged her, and then pulling up her eyelids while she was sleeping to activate her phone’s facial recognition feature.

- 中新网南宁12月11日电 (韦骥 林洁琪)广西南宁市自然资源局11日通报，针对某中介人员以查档为由骗取过户房产的案件，经调查，某中介人员冒充南宁优居房产中介公司身份开展房产交易业务并骗取卖房刷脸过户房产情况属实，其行为属于诈骗行为，目前该中介人员已被公安机关抓获，案件正在侦办阶段。
- 据媒体报道，今年以来，广西南宁的10多名业主委托一家房产中介公司工作人员卖房时，与中介签订了《房地产买卖代办合约》后，被要求在南宁市不动产登记中心的官方APP上刷脸查档，之后房屋就立刻被过户、抵押。
- 事发后，有房主们查询发现，该名置业顾问以查档欺骗大家刷脸后，还伪造了当事人签字，导致房屋直接被过户，涉案金额超过1000万元。
- 南宁市自然资源局通报称，案发后，该局全力配合公安机关调查，并迅速启动了应急预案，对涉案房产进行登记限制，防止相关涉案房产出现再次转移。从公安机关反馈信息和该局收集相关资料来看，可以认为涉案不动产交易均属于真实交易，买卖双方真实存在，买卖合同也均属于双方真实意思表示，但因案件仍存在很多疑点，公安机关在进一步侦查中。
- 针对该案件中涉及的官方app“邕e登”，南宁市自然资源局表示，自推出不动产网上自助办理模式以来，在多个业务类型办理中应用了公安机关和支付宝的人脸识别认证技术，以体现申请人真实意愿的表达和登记信息的确认，且业务办理全流程中在房源核验、信息采集、核税缴税、签署网签合同、提交登记等5个环节设置了5次信息提示、1次电子签名、1次刷脸认证，办理业务全流程清晰便捷、严谨合理。此案尽管涉及刷脸技术应用，但从法律角度分析属于诈骗行为，是不法分子利用了便民措施实施诈骗。
- 南宁市自然资源局也表示，此案不具备普遍性，且均为同一人作案。通过此案也进行了反思，在一些管理手段和系统优化方面仍有可提升的空间。
- 下一步，“邕e登”app将进行优化升级操作，拟与公安机关合作，在人脸识别环节增加语音信息采集功能，通过语音方式确保申请人明确知晓当前人脸识别用途和当前办理业务具体情况。同时，采取两次刷脸认证双重保障和增加刷脸验证码确认功能，让市民使用“邕e登”APP办理不动产登记更便捷、更安全。
- 南宁市自然资源局也将与有关部门建立中介备案监管机制，中介经不动产登记机构审核后，才能使用APP从事代理不动产登记业务，同时，拟通过建立健全不动产登记代理行为诚信机制等方式对房产中介人员代理行为强化约束管理，切实规范房地产中介的代理行为。(完) 【编辑:刘羡】
