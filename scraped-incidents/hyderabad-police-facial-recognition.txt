- Telangana state, India, faces court action for the allegedly illegal use of facial recognition by its police forces.
- The action is being taken by social activist SQ Masood, who alleges Hyderabad City Police had forced him to remove his mask while he was returning home from work during the COVID-19 in May 2021 pandemic so that they could take his photograph and verify his identity.
- Backed by the Internet Freedom Foundation, the June 2021 notice claimed Masood's photographs were likely being fed into a facial recognition database. It also argued that state use of facial recognition 'is not backed by law, is unnecessary, disproportionate, and is being done without any safeguards to prevent misuse'.
- Police denied using facial recognition in this instance, saying Masood's photograph was not scanned against any database and that facial recognition has only been used during the investigation of a crime or suspected crime.
- Telangana state is said to have amongst the highest density of CCTV cameras in the world, and boasts the most known government facial recognition projects in India. Amnesty International has accused Hyderabad of becoming a 'total surveillance city'.

- Hyderabad-based activist SQ Masood said that deploying facial recognition technology was not backed by law and is unnecessary and disproportionate and without any safeguards.
- The Telangana High Court has issued a notice to the state government on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed over the use of facial recognition in the state. The petition, filed by Hyderabad-based activist SQ Masood with the support of the Internet Freedom Foundation, had argued that deploying facial recognition technology by the state was not backed by law, and is unnecessary and disproportionate and without any safeguards. The case will be taken up after the court resumes after vacation.
- In May 2021, the activist had sent a legal notice to the Commissioner of Police of Hyderabad after he was stopped on May 19 by police officers when he was returning home from work.  In the legal notice, Masood said that he had been asked to remove his mask in order to take his picture despite there being a large number of COVID-19 cases. When he refused, his picture was taken anyway. He stated that he was in compliance with all rules. He did not receive an answer from the police commissioner.
- He then filed a public interest litigation in the court against the state of Telangana and the Commissioner of Police stating that the use of facial recognition technology restricts a citizen‚Äôs right to privacy without complying with applicable law. It added that the objective of using facial recognition technology was unclear. It added that there are no procedural safeguards to protect from misuse and ensure that the data collected is used properly.
- ‚ÄúCurrently, the police in Telangana have complete discretion in who to deploy FRT on and where to deploy FRT, apart from covertly capturing photographs through CCTV cameras,‚Äù the petition said, according to IFF.
- It also said that the use of facial recognition technology in Telangana is not for a specific purpose but is used for mass surveillance, and that the state must show probable cause.
- The activist‚Äôs lawyer argued that the use of facial recognition technology violates the right to privacy.
- In November, Amnesty International called Hyderabad as being on the brink of a ‚Äútotal surveillance city‚Äù and pointed out to the Command and Control Centre that wants to connect the ‚Äústate‚Äôs vast facial recognition-capable CCTV infrastructure in real time‚Äù. It also has the most facial recognition technology projects in India.

- A social activist from Hyderabad has filed a petition against the widespread use of facial recognition technology (FRT) in Telangana. Based on the petition, the Telangana High Court issued a notice to the state government and the matter will be heard next on January 15. SQ Masood, who had earlier sent a legal notice to the Hyderabad City Police Commissioner, drafted his recent petition with help from Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) against the Telangana government alleging that — Facial recognition technology restricts the Right to Privacy without complying with applicable law There are lack of procedural safeguards Its deployment was without 'probable or reasonable cause' He urged the High Court to declare the use of FRT by the government as unconstitutional and illegal, and to prohibit government usage by passing any writ of mandamus, writ, direction or order. Of late, the Indian government and several state governments have been turning to facial recognition for policing, identity verification, and even distributing rations. The issue has been debated as privacy was declared a fundamental right in India, but the nation is yet to have a major data privacy law in place. The low accuracy rates of such technology, which may prove to be exclusionary, is a major point of concern. Usage of FRT not in accordance with Puttaswamy judgement The petition which was viewed by MediaNama, said that the usage of FRT in Telangana does not meet the four-fold requirements which were established in the KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and Ors (2017) judgement.…

- The Telangana High Court today issued a notice to the Telangana State Government in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) plea filed challenging the deployment of Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) in the State of Telangana.
- The notice has been issued by a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili on the PIL filed by a social activist from Hyderabad, S. Q. Masood, arguing that the deployment of FRT is not backed by law, is unnecessary, disproportionate, and is being done without any safeguards in place to prevent misuse.
- Background of the PIL
- The petitioner moved the High Court with his PIL after he was stopped by 8-10 police officers in Hyderabad while he was returning home from work in May 2021 and he was directed to remove his mask even though the pandemic was ongoing, and Hyderabad was reporting a large number of cases.
- The PIL states that he was asked to remove his mask because they wanted to take his photograph, and when Mr. Masood refused, they captured his picture anyway.
- Thereafter, concerned with how his picture may be used, and to find out the legal basis of the actions of the police officers, Mr. Masood addressed a legal notice to the Police Commissioner of Hyderabad, however, when he did not receive any answer, he moved to the High Court.
- The PIL (drawn with the legal assistance provided by the 'Internet Freedom Foundation') states that Telangana is the most surveilled place in the world, and the State Government had been deploying Facial Recognition Technology ('FRT') without any legal basis for a range of purposes including but not limited to law enforcement, supplying essential services, and elections.
- Against this backdrop, the PIL has been filed challenging the deployment of Facial Recognition Technology ("FRT") by Respondents in State of Telangana and specifically in Hyderabad for various law enforcement and welfare purposes on various grounds including the violation of right to privacy, rule of law and equality.
- Specifically, the Petitioner has challenged the deployment of Facial Recognition Technology on the ground that such deployment is made:
- The PIL avers that the Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India & Ors (2017) 10 SCC 1, held that the government cannot restrict the right to privacy unless such restriction is based on law, and it is necessary and proportionate but the use of FRT restricts privacy as by way of biometric data it is used to surveil the activities of individuals.
- However, the PIL adds, in the State of Telangana, no law empowers the executive to use FRT. Moreover, it is unclear what is the objective of the deployment, and considering that most FRT technologies are inaccurate, such deployment is not suitable to achieve any objective.
- The PIL states that even though the State of Telangana does have the power to deploy FRT, there must be procedural safeguards to ensure that the power is exercised in a fair, reasonable, and just manner.
- The PIL argued that the deployment of FRT in Telangana is not targeted or specific or narrow and rather it is used for mass surveillance and is violative of the fundamental rights of the residents of the State of Telangana.
- The State of Telangana must demonstrate that there is 'probable or reasonable cause' for deploying FRT which has the effect of mass surveillance, the PIL contends.
- The bench has issued notice to the Telangana State Government after hearing submissions from Mr. Manoj Reddy who represented Mr. Masood in court. The case will now be taken up on 15th January 2022. IFF provided legal support in the drafting of the petition (more details here: https://internetfreedom.in/telangana-high-court-issues-notice-in-indias-first-legal-challenge-to-the-deployment-of-facial-recognition-technology/).

- The PIL was filed by activist S.Q. Masood who was stopped by Hyderabad police in May last year and asked to take his mask off so they could take his photo, despite the second wave of COVID raging. When he refused, they took the photo anyway.

- Listen to this article:
- New Delhi: The Telangana high court on Monday, January 3 issued notice to the state government on a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the increasing use of facial recognition technology (FRT) in the state, Live Law reported.
- The PIL was filed by one S.Q. Masood, a resident of Telangana’s capital Hyderabad after he was stopped by eight to ten police officers on his way home on May 19  last year.
- After he was stopped, the police asked Masood to take off his mask so they could take his picture, despite the country being in the midst of the second wave of coronavirus infections then. When he refused, the police took his picture anyway, without his consent and despite his compliance with all the prevailing lockdown norms and COVID-19 protocols.
- The next day, Masood, a social activist and consultant with various NGOs wrote to the police commissioner, Hyderabad city, raising questions about the reason for these photographs being taken, the legal basis for them to be taken and stored, who would have access to these photographs, the implications on privacy and so on.
- Masood, however, did not receive a response and thus, approached the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), an organisation which works in the domain of digital rights, privacy and free expression. The IFF helped Masood draft a legal notice which was subsequently sent to the police commissioner on May 31. When even this notice was ignored, Masood moved high court.
- The legal notice and the subsequent PIL pulled up the Telangana government on several points. First, it questioned the legal basis for taking photographs of citizens. The right of police to photograph citizens is governed by the Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920 and allows the police to take photographs only of individuals arrested or convicted of a crime.
- It also questioned the motive behind taking these photographs, ostensibly to feed them into a database for use in FRT. Telangana is the Indian state with the highest FRT projects under development and Hyderabad is second in the world in terms of density of CCTV cameras. Worrying developments in the state, such as the government Command and Control Centre (CCC) have led international rights organisations like Amnesty International and Article 19 to raise concerns regarding the Orwellian surveillance implications.

- The PIL also notes that the use of FRT and other such biometric data constitutes a violation of the fundamental right to privacy and cites the Supreme Court judgement in the case of K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India & Others (2017) 10 SCC 1, where the apex court ruled that the right to privacy cannot be restricted unless this restriction is based on a law and is reasonable and proportionate.
- The plea argued that Telangana’s use of FRT is wide, far-reaching and meant for mass surveillance, thus is disproportionate and the state must demonstrate probable cause for deploying the same.
- The PIL also raised the issue that there was a lack of procedural safeguards to keep the government’s mass surveillance powers in check and ensure they are exercised in a reasonable and justified manner.
- The high court bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili issued notice to the state government after hearing the submissions from Masood’s legal counsel, Manoj Reddy. The case has been slated for January 15.

- Story



December 21, 2022
- Country:
- The Associated Press examines the power and influence of predictive and surveillance technologies.
- JERUSALEM (AP)—Majd Ramlawi was serving coffee in Jerusalem’s Old City when a chilling text message appeared on his phone.
- “You have been spotted as having participated in acts of violence in the Al-Aqsa Mosque,” it read in Arabic. “We will hold you accountable.”
- Ramlawi, then 19, was among hundreds of people who civil rights attorneys estimate got the text last year, at the height of one of the most turbulent recent periods in the Holy Land. Many, including Ramlawi, say they only lived or worked in the neighborhood, and had nothing to do with the unrest. What he didn’t know was that the feared internal security agency, the Shin Bet, was using mass surveillance technology mobilized for coronavirus contact tracing, against Israeli residents and citizens for purposes entirely unrelated to COVID-19.
- In the pandemic’s bewildering early days, millions worldwide believed government officials who said they needed confidential data for new tech tools that could help stop coronavirus’ spread. In return, governments got a firehose of individuals’ private health details, photographs that captured their facial measurements and their home addresses.
- As a nonprofit journalism organization, we depend on your support to fund more than 170 reporting projects every year on critical global and local issues. Donate any amount today to become a Pulitzer Center Champion and receive exclusive benefits!
- Now, from Beijing to Jerusalem to Hyderabad, India, and Perth, Australia, The Associated Press has found that authorities used these technologies and data to halt travel for activists and ordinary people, harass marginalized communities and link people’s health information to other surveillance and law enforcement tools. In some cases, data was shared with spy agencies. The issue has taken on fresh urgency almost three years into the pandemic as China’s ultra-strict zero-COVID policies recently ignited the sharpest public rebuke of the country’s authoritarian leadership since the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
- For more than a year, AP journalists interviewed sources and pored over thousands of documents to trace how technologies marketed to “flatten the curve” were put to other uses. Just as the balance between privacy and national security shifted after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, COVID-19 has given officials justification to embed tracking tools in society that have lasted long after lockdowns.
- “Any intervention that increases state power to monitor individuals has a long tail and is a ratcheting system,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Toronto-based internet watchdog Citizen Lab. “Once you get it, is very unlikely it will ever go away.”
- In China, the last major country in the world to enforce strict COVID-19 lockdowns, citizens have been required to install cell-phone apps to move about freely in most cities. Drawing from telecommunications data and PCR test results, the apps produce individual QR codes that change from green to yellow or red, depending on a person’s health status.
- The apps and lockdowns are part of China’s sweeping pandemic prevention policies that have pushed the public to a breaking point. When an apartment fire in Urumqi last month left at least 10 dead, many blamed zero-tolerance COVID policies. That sparked demonstrations in major cities nationwide, the largest display of defiance in decades, after which the government announced it would only check health codes in “special places,” such as schools, hospitals and nursing homes.
- Last week, the government went further, saying it would shut down a national-level health code to ease travel between provinces. But cities and provinces have their own codes, which have been more dominant. In Beijing last week, restaurants, offices, hotels and gyms were still requiring local codes for entry.
- Over the past few years, Chinese citizens have needed a green code to board domestic flights or trains, and in some cities even to enter the supermarket or to get on a bus. If they were found to have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, or if the government imposed a local quarantine, the code would turn red, and they were stuck at home.
- There’s evidence that the health codes have been used to stifle dissent.
- In early September, former wealth manager Yang Jiahao bought a train ticket to Beijing, where he planned to lodge various complaints with the central government. The night before, a woman he described as a handler invited him to dinner. Handlers are usually hired by state security as part of “stability maintenance” operations and can require people to meet or travel when authorities worry they could cause trouble. Yang had a meal with the handler, and the next morning Guangzhou health authorities reported a COVID-19 case less than a kilometer from where they dined, he said.
- Based on city regulations, Yang’s code should have turned yellow, requiring him to take a few COVID tests to show he was negative.
- Instead, the app turned red, even though tests showed that he didn’t have COVID. Yang was ordered to quarantine and a paper seal was placed on his door.
- “They can do whatever they want,” he said.
- An officer at the Huangcun station of the Guangzhou police referred comment to city-level authorities on Yang’s case, saying he required proof that the caller was from AP. Guangzhou’s Public Security Bureau and the city’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention did not respond to faxed requests for comment.
- In another show of how the apps can control lives, in June, a group of bank customers were effectively corralled by the health codes when they tried going to Henan’s provincial capital in Zhengzhou to protest being unable to access their online bank accounts.
- A notice said the problem was due to a system upgrade. But the customers soon found out the real reason: a police investigation into stockholders in the parent bank had rendered 40 billion yuan in funds inaccessible, according to local media reports. Frustrated after months of complaints, a group of customers decided to hold a protest in Zhengzhou at the provincial banking commission.
- Customer Xu Zhihao uploaded his itinerary to get the Henan province health code after he tested negative for COVID-19 in his coastal city of Tianjin, just south of Beijing. As he got off the train in Zhengzhou, Xu was asked to scan his QR code at the station, and immediately it turned red. The train station employee called security and took him to a police booth.
- Xu said police took him to the basement to quarantine. Three other people joined him, and all four realized that they had come to get their money back.
- “They had set the net in place, waiting for us,” Xu said.
- From a group chat, Xu and others learned that many protesters had met a similar fate, at the high-speed rail train station, at the airport and even on the highway. A government inquiry later found that red codes were given to 1,317 people, many of whom had planned to protest.
- China’s National Health Commission, which has led the COVID response, did not reply to a fax requesting comment. The Henan provincial government did not respond either.
- Even after China ends lockdowns, some dissidents and human rights activists predict the local-level health codes will stay on as a technological means of social control. Early on, provinces didn’t share data, but in the past few years, that has changed.
- Some provincial governments have created local apps that can link health, location and even credit information, which leaves open the possibility for these apps or the national databases they draw from to be used to monitor people in the future, according to an AP review of procurement documents, research and interviews. Xu and Yang, for instance, were both stopped in their tracks by local health codes.
- In February, police in northeastern Heilongjiang province sought to upgrade their local health code so they could search PCR test results for anyone in China, in real time, according to procurement documents provided exclusively by ChinaFile, a digital magazine published by the Asia Society. A company whose parent is government-owned won the non-competitive bid to connect that app to a national database of PCR data run by the State Council, China’s Cabinet, fulfilling a national directive, the documents show. The same company, Beijing Beiming Digital Technology, also claims on its website that it has developed more than 30 pandemic apps.
- “It’s the governance model, the philosophy behind it is to strengthen social control through technology. It’s strengthened by the health app, and it’s definitely going to stay after COVID is over,” said Yaqiu Wang, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch. “I think it’s very, very powerful.”
- In Jerusalem’s Old City, tourists sipping fresh pomegranate juice, worshippers and locals taking a shortcut home are all monitored by Israeli security forces holding automatic weapons. The labyrinth of cavernous pathways is also lined with CCTV cameras and what authorities have described as “advanced technologies.”
- After clashes in May 2021 at the Al-Aqsa Mosque helped trigger an 11-day war with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, Israel experienced some of the worst violence in years. Police lobbed stun grenades into the disputed compound known to Jews as the Temple Mount, home to Al-Aqsa, Islam’s third-holiest site, as Palestinian crowds holed up inside hurling stones and firebombs at them.
- By that time, Israelis had become accustomed to police showing up outside their homes to say they weren’t observing quarantine and knew that Israel’s Shin Bet security agency was repurposing phone surveillance technology it had previously used to monitor militants inside Palestinian territories. The practice made headlines at the start of the pandemic when the Israeli government said it would be deployed for COVID-19 contact tracing.
- A year later, the Shin Bet quietly began using the same technology to send threatening messages to Israel’s Arab citizens and residents whom the agency suspected of participating in violent clashes with police. Some of the recipients, however, simply lived or worked in the area, or were mere passers-by.
- Ramlawi’s coffeeshop sits in the ornate Cotton Merchant’s Market outside the mosque compound, an area lined with police and security cameras that likely would have identified the barista had he participated in violence.
- Although Ramlawi deleted the message and hasn’t received a similar one since, he said the thought of his phone being used as a monitoring tool still haunts him.
- “It’s like the government is in your bag,” said Ramlawi, who worries that surveillance enabled to stop COVID-19 poses a lasting menace for east Jerusalem residents. “When you move, the government is with you with this phone.”
- The Shin Bet’s domestic use of the technology has generated an uproar over privacy and civil liberties within Israel, as well as questions about its accuracy. The Ministry of Communications, which oversees Israel’s telecommunications companies, refused a request seeking further details submitted for AP by the Movement for Freedom of Information, a nonprofit that frequently works with media organizations.
- Gil Gan-Mor, an attorney with the nonprofit Association for Civil Rights in Israel, estimates that hundreds of Arabs in Jerusalem received the threatening message during the unrest and said the mass text message blast was unprecedented.
- “You cannot just say to people, ‘We are watching you ... and we will get revenge,” he said. “You cannot use this tool to frighten people. If you have something against someone, you can put them on trial.’”
- After Gan-Mor’s organization sued, Shin Bet made no apologies.
- Click here to read the AP graphic, "Surveillance by country."
- “There was a clear security need to send an urgent message to a very large number of people, all of whom had a credible suspicion of being involved in performing violent crimes,” the agency said in a legal filing last year. The filing, signed by “Daniella B.,” the Shin Bet’s legal adviser for the Jerusalem district, also acknowledged that “lessons were learned.”
- In February, Israel’s attorney general upheld the continued use of the technology, saying it was a legitimate security tool, while acknowledging glitches in the system and that messages were distributed to a small number of unintended targets. Israel’s Supreme Court is now reviewing the matter.
- Sami Abu Shehadeh, a former Arab lawmaker who served in Israel’s parliament at the time Shin Bet sent its warning texts, said the messages demonstrate the broader struggles of Israel’s 20% Arab minority.
- “The state does not deal with us as citizens,” he said. “There are two sets of laws -- one for Jews and one for Arabs.”
- Technologies designed to combat COVID-19 were redirected by law enforcement and intelligence services in other democracies as governments expanded their digital arsenals amid the pandemic.
- In India, facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology exploded after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party swept into power in 2014, becoming a tool for police to monitor mass gatherings. The country is seeking to build what will be among the world’s largest facial recognition networks.
- As the pandemic took hold in early 2020, state and central governments tasked local police with enforcing mask mandates. Fines of up to $25, as much as 12 days’ pay for some laborers and unaffordable for the nearly 230 million people estimated to be living in poverty in India, were introduced in some places.
- In the south-central city of Hyderabad, police started taking pictures of people flaunting the mask mandate or simply wearing masks haphazardly.
- Police Commissioner C.V. Anand said the city has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years on patrol vehicles, CCTV cameras, facial recognition and geo-tracking applications and several hundred facial recognition cameras, among other technologies powered by algorithms or machine learning. Inside Hyderabad’s Command and Control Center, officers showed an AP reporter how they run CCTV camera footage through facial recognition software that scans images against a database of offenders.
- “When (companies) decide to invest in a city, they first look at the law-and-order situation,” Anand said, defending the use of such tools as absolutely necessary. “People here are aware of what the technologies can do, and there is wholesome support for it.”
- By May 2020, the police chief of Telangana state tweeted about his department rolling out AI-based software using CCTV to zero-in on people not wearing masks. The tweet included photos of the software overlaying colored rectangles on the maskless faces of unsuspecting locals.
- More than a year later, police tweeted images of themselves using hand-held tablets to scan people’s faces using facial recognition software, according to a post from the official Twitter handle of the station house officer in the Amberpet neighborhood.
- Police said the tablets, which can take ordinary photographs or link them to a facial recognition database of criminals, were a useful way for officers to catch and fine mask offenders.
- “When they see someone not wearing a mask, they go up to them, take a photo on their tablet, take down their details like phone number and name,” said B Guru Naidu, an inspector in Hyderabad’s South Zone.
- Officers decide who they deem suspicious, stoking fears among privacy advocates, some Muslims and members of Hyderabad’s lower-caste communities.
- “If the patrolling officers suspect any person, they take their fingerprints or scan their face – the app on the tablet will then check these for any past criminal antecedents,” Naidu said.
- S Q Masood, a social activist who has led government transparency campaigns in Hyderabad, sees more at stake. Masood and his father-in-law were seemingly stopped at random by police in Shahran market, a predominantly Muslim area, during a COVID-19 surge last year. Masood said officers told him to remove his mask so they could photograph him with a tablet.
- “I told them I won’t remove my mask. They then asked me why not, and I told them I will not remove my mask.” He said they photographed him with it in place. Back home, Masood went from bewildered to anxious: Where and how was this photo to be used? Would it be added to the police’s facial recognition database?
- Now he’s suing in the Telangana High Court to find out why his photo was taken and to limit the widespread use of facial recognition. His case could set the tone for India’s growing ambition to combine emerging technology with law enforcement in the world’s largest democracy, experts said.
- India lacks a data protection law, and even existing proposals won’t regulate surveillance technologies if they become law, said Apar Gupta, executive director of the New Delhi-based Internet Freedom Foundation, which is helping to represent Masood.
- Police responded to Masood’s lawsuit and denied using facial recognition in his case, saying that his photograph was not scanned against any database and that facial recognition is only used during the investigation of a crime or suspected crime, when it can be run against CCTV footage.
- In two separate AP interviews, local police demonstrated both how the TSCOP app carried by police on the street can compare a person’s photograph to a facial recognition database of criminals, and how from the Command and Control Center police can use facial recognition analysis to compare stored mugshots of criminals to video gathered from CCTV cameras.
- Masood’s lawyers are working on a response and awaiting a hearing date.
- Privacy advocates in India believe that such stepped-up actions under the pandemic could enable what they call 360 degree surveillance, under which things like housing, welfare, health and other kinds of data are all linked together to create a profile.
- “Surveillance today is being posed as a technological panacea to large social problems in India, which has brought us very close to China,” Gupta said. “There is no law. There are no safeguards. And this is general purpose deployment of mass surveillance.”
- What use will ultimately be made of the data collected and tools developed during the height of the pandemic remains an open question. But recent uses in Australia and the United States may offer a glimpse.
- During two years of strict border controls, Australia’s conservative former Prime Minister Scott Morrison took the extraordinary step of appointing himself minister of five departments, including the Department of Health. Authorities introduced both national and state-level apps to notify people when they had been in the vicinity of someone who tested positive for the virus.
- But the apps were also used in other ways. Australia’s intelligence agencies were caught “incidentally” collecting data from the national COVIDSafe app. News of the breach surfaced in a November 2020 report by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, which said there was no evidence that the data was decrypted, accessed or used. The national app was canceled in August by a new administration as a waste of money: it had identified only two positive COVID-19 cases that wouldn’t have been found otherwise.
- At the local level, people used apps to tap their phones against a site’s QR code, logging their individual ID so that if a COVID-19 outbreak occurred, they could be contacted. The data sometimes was used for other purposes. Australian law enforcement co-opted the state-level QR check-in data as a sort of electronic dragnet to investigate crimes.
- After biker gang boss Nick Martin was shot and killed at a speedway in Perth, police accessed QR code check-in data from the health apps of 2,439 drag racing fans who attended the December 2020 race. It included names, phone numbers and arrival times.
- Police accessed the information despite Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan’s promise on Facebook that the COVID-related data would only be accessible to contact-tracing personnel at the Department of Health. The murder was eventually solved using entirely traditional policing tactics, including footprint matching, cellphone tracking and ultimately a confession.
- Western Australia police didn’t respond to requests for comment. Queensland and Victoria law enforcement also sought the public’s QR check-in data in connection with investigations. Police in both states did not address AP questions regarding why they sought the data, and lawmakers in Queensland and Victoria have since tightened the rules on police access to QR check-in information.
- In the U.S., which relied on a hodge-podge of state and local quarantine orders to ensure compliance with COVID rules, the federal government took the opportunity to build out its surveillance toolkit, including two contracts in 2020 worth $24.9 million to the data mining and surveillance company Palantir Technologies Inc. to support the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ pandemic response. Documents obtained by the immigrant rights group Just Futures Law under the Freedom of Information Act and shared with AP showed that federal officials contemplated how to share data that went far beyond COVID-19.
- The possibilities included integrating “identifiable patient data,” such as mental health, substance use and behavioral health information from group homes, shelters, jails, detox facilities and schools. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control does not use any of that individual-level information in the platform CDC now manages, said Kevin Griffis, a department spokesman. Griffis said he could not comment on discussions that occurred under the previous administration.
- The protocols appeared to lack information safeguards or usage restrictions, said Paromita Shah, Just Futures Law’s executive director.
- “What the pandemic did was blow up an industry of mass collection of biometric and biographical data,” Shah said. “So, few things were off the table.”
- Last year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control purchased detailed cellphone location data revealing people’s daily whereabouts, nationwide. “Mobility insights” data from at least 20 million devices could be used to “project how much worse things would have been without the bans,” such as stay-at-home orders and business closures, according to a July 2021 contract obtained by the nonprofit group Tech Inquiry and shared with the AP.
- The contract shows data broker Cuebiq provided a “device ID,” which typically ties information to individual cell phones. The CDC also could use the information to examine the effect of closing borders, an emergency measure ordered by the Trump administration and continued by President Joe Biden, despite top scientists’ objections that there was no evidence the action would slow the coronavirus.
- CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said the agency acquired aggregated, anonymous data with extensive privacy protections for public health research, but did not address questions about whether the agency was still using the data. The CDC could still access aggregate, county-level mobile phone data through October, several months after its contract ended, Cuebiq spokesman Bill Daddi said on Tuesday. He added that before then, the CDC also could have analyzed privacy-protected individual mobile phone data, but chose not to.
- For Scott-Railton, that sets a dangerous precedent.
- “What COVID did was accelerate state use of these tools and that data and normalize it, so it fit a narrative about there being a public benefit,” he said. “Now the question is, are we going to be capable of having a reckoning around the use of this data, or is this the new normal?”

- Discrepancies in proposed usage statements and increasing pressure from civil rights groups and activists is putting law enforcement’s use of facial recognition technology in the spotlight in India and Ireland.
- The Oireachtas justice committee in Ireland has issued new recommendations suggesting cameras worn by the national police service (Garda) should not use facial recognition technology (FRT) or be used to racially profile members of the public.
- Reported by the Irish Examiner, the news comes months after the country’s cabinet approved the provision for the use of body-worn cameras (BWCs) with draft legislation in July.
- The cameras were first approved in 2020, and have since been under scrutiny from certain civil rights groups.
- Now, the Oireachtas justice committee is suggesting 15 new recommendations regarding the use of biometrics-powered cameras.
- These include a call for open regulation of facial recognition technology on both body-worn cameras and fixed security cameras, stricter regulation regarding activation and deactivation of the devices, an improved definition of ‘recording device’ to limit the use of future biometric technologies, and protocols designed to process evidence captured during interactions with suspects.
- Further, the committee recommended a pilot scheme to test the efficiency and impact of these solutions before official deployment.
- According to the Oireachtas justice committee, these concerns were sparked by a potential discrepancy spotted by its members between statements by the Department of Justice that facial recognition will not be used in certain scenarios, and details from the An Garda Síochána modernization plan 2016-2021 suggesting otherwise.
- Hyderabad-based activist SQ Masood, backed by the Internet Freedom Foundation, has filed a petition with the Telangana High Court in India to review the use of facial recognition in the Indian state.
- In its filing, the activist said the deployment of the biometric cameras was not only not backed by law, but also unnecessary, disproportionate, and without any safeguards.
- Spotted by The News Minute, the petition was filed by Masood after being stopped by police and asked to remove his face mask, so that a photo may be taken of him for identification purposes.
- The activist was reportedly reluctant to do so, concerned about removing his mask due to a rising number of COVID cases in the area, but the police forced him to do so anyway.
- Upon bringing up the situation with the Commissioner of Police, Masood reportedly did not receive an answer, so decided to file public interest litigation in the court against the state of Telangana and the police.
- The Telangana High Court will take up the case when the court returns from Christmas break.
