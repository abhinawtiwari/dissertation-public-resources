- Tesla has made changes to its vehicle security cameras after an Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens (Dutch Data Protection Authority) investigation into whether the car maker had violated the privacy of people coming close to its cars. Tesla's Sentry Mode uses four cameras continuously filming everything around a parked vehicle to protect it against theft and vandalism, with images saved for one hour in the car.
- Since the investigation began, the Authority said Tesla had made changes to Sentry Mode, include making the cars' headlights flash to indicate to passers-by that filming has begun, and requiring approval from the car's owners in order to begin filming. Accordingly, the car's owners would be legally responsible for improper filming, the Authority said.

- AMSTERDAM, Feb 22 (Reuters) - The Dutch personal data watchdog said on Wednesday it would not fine Tesla Inc. (TSLA.O) over possible privacy violations after the U.S. carmaker made changes to vehicle security cameras.
- Tesla uses such cameras in its cars to help owners protect them against theft or vandalism, but the Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) investigated them as a potential violation.
- "Many Teslas parked on the street were often filming everyone who came near the vehicle, and these images were being saved for a very long time. If every car were to do that, we’d have a situation where no one could go anywhere in public without being watched," said DPA board member Katja Mur in a statement.
- Tesla could not immediately be reached for comment.
- The agency said Tesla had made changes to its "Sentry Mode" feature in which the cameras are activated since the DPA investigation began. These include the cars' headlights flashing to indicate to passers-by that filming has begun and requiring approval from the car's owners in order to begin filming.
- Films are stored in the car, and not shared with Tesla, the DPA said.
- The agency said as a result, the car's owners, rather than Tesla, would be legally responsible for improper filming.
- "The DPA's investigation has not resulted in a fine or other sanction for Tesla," it said.

- The Dutch safety watchdog decided on Wednesday that it had concluded its investigation into Tesla and wouldn’t issue a fine against the company for its vehicle’s security cameras. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (DPA) carried out an investigation over concerns Tesla vehicles could be violating privacy laws with its security camera feature.
- Tesla introduced cameras as a safety feature to protect owners’ cars against theft. When the vehicle is parked, the security camera will automatically turn on when it senses a threat or someone walking too close to the car.
- While the feature may seem invaluable to the car owner, the Dutch watchdog said this could pose a threat to passersby who are unwillingly being recorded. The system could keep the footage for a lengthy period of time, which prompted the watchdog to issue an investigation.
- “Many Teslas parked on the street were often filming everyone who came near the vehicle, and these images were being saved for a very long time. If every car were to do that, we’d have a situation where no one could go anywhere in public without being watched,” DPA board member Katja Mur said in a statement to Reuters.
- Tesla backtracked on how the feature is used following the DPA’s investigation by requiring the owner to approve the camera to record and alert people that the camera turned on by flashing its headlights. The agency said because of the changes to its “Sentry Mode” feature, it “has not resulted in a fine or other sanction for Tesla,” Reuters reported.
- Tesla did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment.
- The DPA said in light of Tesla’s security camera change requiring owners to take responsibility for filming, those who retain ownership of the vehicle could be charged for improper or excessive filming. Tesla also warns owners on its website that they are liable if they breach local privacy laws.
- The site says, “It is your [the owner’s] sole responsibility to consult and comply with all local regulations and property restrictions regarding the use of cameras.” The security camera feature is only available on Model Y, Model S, Model X, and Model 3 vehicles and the site says it can be disabled through the settings on the in-car touchscreen.

- In an effort to assuage fears about the dangers inherent in its autopilot system, Tesla has announced that the in-cabin cameras in its Model 3 and Y vehicles will now monitor drivers for “attentiveness” while the feature is turned on, TechCrunch reports.
- The cameras in question are located above the rearview mirror and, when engaged, are already used in a limited capacity by the company to record and store data about “safety events,” i.e., fender-benders or worse. Now, however, they’ll automatically turn on whenever drivers initiate the car’s advanced driver assistance system. The changes, announced in a recent software update, will also get the car to yell at you if it thinks you’re not paying enough attention, says TechCrunch, citing online reports from multiple Tesla owners who’ve begun to receive the update.
- This switch-up definitely makes sense, since Tesla’s autopilot feature has gotten it into some hot water over the last several years. While Tesla makes it clear that autopilot is “not a self-driving system” and is designed for a “fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any time,” the feature has nevertheless been abused and misused repeatedly—leading to a number of crashes, including  fatal ones.
- Now, in what seems like an effort to avoid more episodes like the one involving this raving maniac, the company is clamping down by making sure that you’re still, like, sitting upright and looking at the road while autopilot is turned on. If you have somehow fallen asleep at the wheel, the car will send you an alert.
- “The cabin camera above your rearview mirror can now detect and alert driver inattentiveness while Autopilot is engaged. Camera data does not leave the car itself, which means the system cannot save or transmit information unless data sharing is enabled,” the company told drivers in a statement, clearly trying to assuage privacy fears.
- While improving safety, this is also probably liability limiting for Tesla so that, in the event of a crash, the cameras can verify that it was the driver’s fault, not some rogue AI insurrection a la HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey.
- Telsa shut down its press department recently, so there’s no one to ask for comment.

- An investigation by authorities in the Netherlands prompted electric car manufacturer Tesla to reduce the period of time in which video footage captured by their parked vehicles’ external cameras is stored. Additionally, the cameras will no longer record footage by default, the Dutch Date Protection Authority (DPA) said on Wednesday.
- “The DPA conducted an investigation into the Sentry Mode in Tesla vehicles. This is a feature intended to protect the vehicles against theft and vandalism, among other things. It does this by recording images using four external cameras on the vehicle,” the DPA said.
- “When Sentry Mode was enabled, the cameras continuously filmed everything around the parked vehicle, and these images were saved for one hour,” the DPA continued. “And if a user does turn them on, no more than the last 10 minutes of footage is saved.” The cameras will be disabled by default once software updates are applied. If a Tesla is touched while in Sentry Mode, it can send a notification to the vehicle owner, who can then turn the cameras on and record footage.
- The DPA said that it makes the vehicles more “privacy-friendly,” as Tesla models parked on the street often filmed anything and everyone who came in close proximity to a vehicle. Additionally, the images were stored for an extended period of time. “If every car were to do that, we’d have a situation where no one could go anywhere in public without being watched,” said DPA board member Katja Mur.
- “If a person parked one of these vehicles in front of someone’s window, they could spy inside and see everything the other person was doing. That is a serious violation of privacy.”
- When Tesla cameras are recording, a message stating this may be displayed on the vehicle’s touchscreen as a public warning. Additionally, the headlights can pulse as an alert. Video is stored at the vehicle, and not shared with Tesla.
- From now on, the cameras are off by default. If someone touches the car, the owner will receive a notification on his or her phone. Then the cameras can be turned on. They then store a maximum of 10 minutes of images.
- The car manufacturer will not be fined by the Dutch DPA as the vehicle owners are legally responsible for the recordings caught by their car’s cameras. “Tesla has also reduced the risk of the owners of its cars violating the law by illegally filming people,” Mur said.
