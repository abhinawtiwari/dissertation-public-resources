- TikTok owner Bytedance has openly accused Chinese technology giant Tencent of blocking links to its products.
- In a lengthy online post (Mandarin), Bytedance says Tencent is blocking traffic from its mobile social services WeChat and QQ to its own short-form video applications Douyin, Huoshan, and Xigua.
- Bytedance says Tencent's practice of blocking links to competitor sites has been going on for years.
- Bytedance is not the only company in Tencent's sights; the technology company is also known to prohibit users from opening links to Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall online marketplaces.
- In September 2021, China's industry ministry instructed Alibaba, Tencent, Huawei and other large internet companies to stop blocking links to each other's sites, and threatened to take action against those that failed to heed its warning.

- ByteDance, the owner of the viral video platform TikTok and Douyin, briefly attacked Chinese tech giant Tencent in a long, strident online post on Friday. The tussle between two Chinese tech heavyweights comes amid increased governmental scrutiny on anti-competitive behavior in the tech sector.
- ByteDance criticized Tencent’s practice of blocking links to its products on messaging platforms WeChat and QQ in an online post, attaching a 59-page PDF file chronicling the blocking activities in the past three years. The company has since deleted the post and the file.
- “More than 49 million people were stopped from sharing Douyin content to WeChat and QQ every day on average,” said ByteDance’s post. The company didn’t specify how they calculated the number.
- ByteDance complained that Tencent has been blocking links to its short-formed video apps Douyin, Huoshan, and Xigua, for three years, “affecting more than 1 billion users.”
- ByteDance’s high-profile complaint came as Chinese regulators crack down on tech companies’ anti-competitive behavior. ByteDance could benefit if regulators take action against Tencent’s link blocking practice. The company competes with Tencent on multiple fronts, including news aggregation and online games.
- In March, Reuters reported that China’s top antitrust regulator was looking into Tencent’s WeChat for monopolistic practices, and how the popular messaging app had possibly squeezed smaller competitors.
- ByteDance declined to comment on the situation when reached by TechNode. Tencent also declined to comment. Chinese media saved a copy of ByteDance’s post.
- Tencent is not the only company that tries to stop users from clicking into rival ecosystems. Tencent has banned links of ByteDance’s Douyin and productivity tool Feishu on WeChat. It also prohibits users from opening links to e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall online marketplaces.
- Alibaba also bans (in Chinese) merchants from listing their WeChat contact information on the platform.
- In August, ByteDance’s Douyin said it would ban links to third-party e-commerce sites, including Taobao and Tencent-backed JD.com, on its live-streaming channels in October. However, it also relies (in Chinese) on selling ads with links to those e-commerce sites for its short video feature.
- ByteDance wrote that the post was a response to a comment made by Tencent executive Sun Zhonghuai last Thursday at an industrial forum. Sun compared short-form videos to food for pigs.
- Sun, a Tencent vice president and chief executive officer of the company’s online video department, said short-video apps were feeding users vulgar content. “Because the personalized recommendation [algorithms] are so powerful, if you like pigswill, all you see is pigswill, nothing else,” Sun said.
- Sun is responsible for Tencent’s video-streaming platform Tencent Video and short-video app Weishi, according to Chinese media reports.
- ByteDance defended short videos in the post, saying Sun’s remarks were “arrogant and unfair.” “As a new form of communication, short videos help countless ordinary people record and share their lives, allowing more people to see a larger world.”
- ByteDance also hinted in the post that Tencent’s criticism of short videos was insincere, pointing out that Tencent had tried various times to make short video apps while calling them “pigswill.”
- In the attached PDF file (in Chinese), ByteDance listed evidence that Tencent had blocked links to ByteDance’s short-video apps Douyin, Xigua, and Huoshan on WeChat, while allowed Tencent-backed Kuaishou and Weishi to share links on the social media platform.
- The file mainly consists of annals of news coverage of Tencent and ByteDance’s conflicts from 2018 to 2021 and ByteDance’s summary of those events.
- “We see this pamphlet as a standing reference to the [link] blocking and monopoly. It always reminds us that time may erase memories, but time cannot erase facts,” wrote ByteDance in the now-deleted post (our translation).
- ByteDance sued Tencent in February for blocking Douyin’s content on WeChat and QQ, citing China’s Anti-Monopoly Law.
- Bytedance accused Tencent of violating Anti-Monopoly Law and “misusing a market-dominant position,” “excluding and restricting competition.”
- The lawsuit is still awaiting a first hearing date at the Beijing Intellectual Property Court. Tencent has requested (in Chinese) the case be transferred to a court in Shenzhen, where the company is headquartered.
- In 2019, a Chinese lawyer sued Tencent for blocking Alibaba’s Taobao links. He dropped the case in early 2020 for “a lack of evidence.” But since then, anti-monopoly enforcement has taken off.
- Zhang Zhengxin, the lawyer who sued Tencent, told TechNode in December that his odds to win the case would “increase by a lot” if the case had gone to court then.
- In December, China fined a batch of tech companies over antitrust violations for the first time. A month before that, China’s top antitrust regulator proposed new guidelines targeting anti-competitive behavior to include internet companies.

- China’s top antitrust regulator is looking into Tencent’s WeChat for monopolistic practices and how the popular messaging app had possibly squeezed smaller competitors, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources.
- Why it matters: The latest development in China’s antitrust campaign indicates that Tencent, the country’s largest social media and gaming company, might be the next tech behemoth to be targeted. The company had previously been sued by rivals for anti-competitive behaviors.
- Details: Wu Zhenguo, the head of China’s State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR), expressed concern about some of Tencent’s business practices, and asked the firm to comply with antitrust rules when he met with Tencent founder Pony Ma this month, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing two people with direct knowledge.
- Context: SAMR had previously targeted Tencent in its antitrust actions. It fined a Tencent affiliate in December over unreported acquisition and merger deals and punished Tencent earlier this month for the same reason.

- (Reuters) - Pony Ma, the founder of Tencent Holdings, China’s biggest social media and video games company, met with antitrust watchdog officials this month to discuss compliance at his group, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
- The meeting is the most concrete indication yet that China’s unprecedented antitrust crackdown, which started late last year with billionaire Jack Ma’s Alibaba business empire, could soon target other internet behemoths.
- Beijing has vowed to strengthen oversight of its big tech firms, which rank among the world’s largest and most valuable, citing concerns that they have built market power that stifles competition, misused consumer data and violated consumer rights.
- Tencent, whose WeChat messaging and payment mobile app is ubiquitous in China, is expected to be the next in line for sharper antitrust regulatory inquiries, said the three people.
- News of the meeting, which has not been previously reported, came ahead of Tencent’s December quarter results on Wednesday, in which the company reported a forecast-beating 175% rise in quarterly profit, helped by a surge in gaming revenues.
- Speaking to reporters following the earnings announcement, Ma said the company was “working actively” with regulators on compliance, including combing through some of its previous investments. He did not refer to the meeting.
- Tencent President Martin Lau said the company’s interaction with the antitrust watchdog was part of the normal course of business.
- “We, Tencent, conduct meetings with regulators on a regular basis and this is one of the regular meetings that we have,” Lau said.
- “During the meeting, we had a discussion about a broad range of topics, and the main focus was actually on creating a healthy environment for innovation.”
- Ma, who seldom gives media interviews and had been out of the public eye for more than a year, was in Beijing this month for China’s annual parliamentary meeting and visited the State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) office the week before last, said the people.
- The Tencent founder, ranked this month as China’s second-richest person with a $74 billion fortune, is a parliamentary delegate with Guangdong province, where the company is headquartered.
- Tencent requested the meeting with SAMR deputy head Gan Lin and other senior officials, said the three people.
- Tencent and SAMR did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
- At the meeting, the two parties discussed how Tencent could better comply with antitrust rules, two of the people said.
- Wu Zhenguo, the head of SAMR’s anti-monopoly bureau, who was also at the meeting, expressed concern about some of Tencent’s business practices, and asked the group to comply with antitrust rules, one of them said.
- SAMR is currently gathering information and looking into monopolistic practices by WeChat, and whether the super app has squashed fair competition and squeezed smaller rivals, two of the people said.
- All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
- Tencent shares dropped as much as 1.7% in a weaker Hong Kong market to touch the day’s lowest level after the Reuters report. The stock ended down 0.8%.
- The meeting between Ma, who is also Tencent’s chairman and chief executive, and the antitrust officials came a few days after he called for tighter governance of the internet economy at China’s parliamentary meeting in Beijing.
- Ma’s discreet public profile is in sharp contrast to that of unrelated fellow entrepreneur Jack Ma at Alibaba, whose public criticism of China’s regulators triggered a chain of events that resulted in the last minute halting of fintech affiliate Ant Group’s $37 billion IPO last November.
- One of the people said that Tencent had not been officially notified by SAMR of any investigation into its activities, but is expecting to hear from the regulator soon.
- “As one of China’s big two, it’s perfectly normal that Tencent felt anxiety about being targeted,” said You Yunting, a lawyer with Shanghai-based DeBund Law Offices, referring to Ma’s meeting with the regulatory officials.
- “There are two worries for Tencent, a concentration of undertakings review could impact acquisition deals, while investigations and litigations on abuse of dominant market positions could hurt the advantage of its platforms.”
- To cushion the impact of any potential moves against it, Tencent has been scrambling to take corrective action.
- Tencent is having to offer concessions in a plan to merge the country’s top two videogame live-streaming sites in order to resolve antitrust concerns, Reuters reported on Tuesday.
- In a separate deal, the firm, which held a 5% stake in local gaming firm Zhejiang Century Huatong Group, had also planned to buy another 10%, said one of the people and another person with direct knowledge, making it the largest shareholder.
- Earlier this month, however, Tencent acquired 5% of Century Huatong and became the second-largest shareholder instead, looking to avoid a potentially lengthy and complicated antitrust approval process, the two people said.

- Beijing's latest step aimed at ending 'walled gardens' of online tech giants
- BEIJING (Reuters) -- China's industry ministry said on Monday it has told the country's internet companies to end their long-standing practice of blocking each other's links on their sites, vowing to take measures against those firms that fail to fall in line.
- The move, which would put an end to what analysts have called the "walled gardens" of China's giant online firms, is just the latest step in a broad regulatory crackdown by Beijing that has ensnared sectors from technology to education and property.
- The government's campaign has wiped billions of dollars off the market value of some of the country's largest companies, and left investors on edge over which sector may be next to be targeted.
- Announcing the measure in the capital, Zhao Zhiguo, spokesperson of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that restricting normal access to internet links without proper reason "affects the user experience, damages the rights of users and disrupts market order."
- The new Beijing instruction came after the 21st Century Business Herald newspaper reported on Saturday that China's industry ministry told tech giants including Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings to stop blocking each other's website links from their platforms.
- China's internet is dominated by a handful of technology giants which have historically blocked links and services by rivals on their platforms.
- Tencent, for example, restricts users from sharing content from ByteDance-owned short video app Douyin on Tencent's instant messaging apps WeChat and QQ. In February, Douyin filed a complaint with a Beijing court saying that it constituted as monopolistic behavior.
- In other cases, Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall e-commerce marketplaces do not allow Tencent's payment service WeChat Pay to be used as a payment option.
- Tencent told the state-backed Securities Times newspaper that it firmly supported the ministry's decision and would implement it in phases. Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
- Industry ministry official Zhao did not mention any specific firms in comments on the new instruction to companies, but said that there was still a gap between the understanding of some internet companies on the issue of blocking links and the actions required of them.
