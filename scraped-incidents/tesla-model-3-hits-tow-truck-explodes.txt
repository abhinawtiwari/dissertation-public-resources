- A Tesla Model 3 driven by businessman Alexey Tretyakov, 41, hit a parked tow truck that servicing another vehicle on a ring road outside Moscow, Russia, in August 2019. Tretyakov and his two children escaped the car before it was exploded and caught fire, but were severely injured and rushed to hospital. Tretyakov suffered a broken leg and chest injury, while his children reportedly suffered bruises and concussion.
- Tretyakov and the police have since confirmed the car was on Autopilot. The driver also said the car had been in 'drive assistance mode', in which enhanced safety features are enabled but the driver’s hands remain on the wheel, and that he had failed to see the truck.

- A Tesla electric car caught fire after crashing into a tow truck on a Moscow motorway late on Saturday.
- Footage of the incident on state TV channel Rossia 24 showed the car by the side of the road engulfed in flames and thick black smoke. Two small explosions occurred within a few seconds of each other.
- It was not possible to tell which Tesla model the car was and only the metal frame remained after the fire.
- Tesla Inc stood by safety claims for its Model 3 earlier this week in the face of regulatory scrutiny, while documents showed the top U.S. automotive safety watchdog issued at least five subpoenas since last year seeking information about crashes involving the company's vehicles.
- The state-run RIA news agency website posted a video showing the car driving in the left-hand lane of Moscow's ring road, known as the MKAD, before crashing into a tow truck parked by a safety fence that separates the carriageway from oncoming traffic.

- Tesla fires are back in the news today due to a Model 3 exploding after a crash with a tow truck in Moscow.
- The vehicle was reportedly on Autopilot at the time of the accident.
- Russian businessman Alexey Tretyakov was driving his Model 3 (previous Russian reports stated that it was a Model S) last night when it hit a tow truck that was servicing a vehicle on the highway near Moscow.
- According to local media, he and his two children were severely injured and transported to the hospital.
- Update: Tretyakov has now confirmed that he suffered a broken leg and his children got bruises, but everyone is otherwise OK.
- The Model S caught on fire shortly after the accident and then exploded.
- Passersby captured several impressive videos of the fire and following explosions, which happened while there was still heavy traffic around the burning vehicle:

- 
- According to Russian media outlet Zvezda, the police believes that the Tesla Model 3 was on Autopilot (translated from Russian):
- According to a law enforcement source, the Tesla was probably driving on Autopilot and couldn’t recognize the tow truck in front of it, after which it caught fire.
- Update: Tretyakov has also since confirmed that he was on Autopilot.
- There were previous accidents involving Tesla vehicles on Autopilot crashing into stopped or stalled vehicles on the highway, including a fatal crash with a street sweeper truck in China in 2016.
- Tesla asks that drivers always keep their hands on the steering wheel when using Autopilot, and that they stay ready to take control at any time.
- The automaker insists that it is safer to drive on Autopilot than without, and that its vehicles are much less likely to catch on fire than gas-powered vehicles.
- Tesla backs those claims with quarterly safety reports.
- In its latest safety report, Tesla claimed that there was a Tesla vehicle fire for every 170 million miles traveled between 2012 and 2018 compared to a vehicle fire for every 19 million miles traveled in the US.
- That’s a tragic accident and hopefully, they all survive their injuries. (Update: looks like nothing too severe.)
- These kinds of accidents involving Autopilot, if it was indeed on Autopilot, always bring up the issue of whether or not Autopilot makes you more or less alert.
- I think it depends on each individual.
- For me, it’s helpful. The reduced workload helps me focus on the road ahead, and since I am aware that AP is far from perfect, I am always ready to intervene.
- However, it’s clear that some people are growing way too confident in the system, as we have learned of several accidents over the years where the drivers had a lot of time to react but didn’t until it was too late.
- I am not saying that it is the case here, but it’s something that everyone should keep in mind when using the driver-assist system, because that’s what it is: a driver-assist system and not a driver replacement.

- This past Saturday, news broke about a Tesla crashing into a parked tow truck and bursting into flames on a motorway in Moscow, Russia. Particularly notable about the incident was that after the initial crash, explosions racked the already burning electric car.
- A number of developments have emerged about the story so far, which clarified initial misconceptions about the incident, from the make of the vehicle to the injuries incurred by its occupants.  With this in mind, Teslarati has compiled this quick guide about what is currently known about this crash and its ensuing fiery aftermath.
- A video of the accident taken from what appears to be a security camera showed the electric sedan passing a first stopped vehicle that had broken down and catching the corner of a tow truck that was sticking out into the adjacent lane. In a statement to CrimeRussia, Aleksey Tretyakov, the vehicle’s owner, noted that he had been traveling at 100 km/h, the speed limit in the area. The impact from the collision was enough to push the tow truck forward into the central dividing wall.
- A video of the exact moment the Tesla crashed into the tow truck could be viewed below.
- Initial reports that emerged following the accident tagged the Tesla as a Model S. With more videos of the crash’s aftermath emerging online, it now appears that the electric car involved in the accident was a Model 3, at least based on the shape of the vehicle’s taillights and headlights.
- Videos of the Tesla on fire and the explosions that followed emerged on the heels of the accident. These clips, which were separate from the footage of the electric car crashing into the parked tow truck, showed a vehicle that was already ablaze. Two explosions could be seen in the videos, which resulted in parts of the electric car flying to the air.
- Quite interestingly, the explosion within the vehicle seemed to have happened after the tow truck that the Tesla crashed into had been moved (the heavy vehicle does not seem to be in the vicinity when the explosions happened). As observed by Tesla Motors Club member KarenRei, the nature of the explosion in the Model 3 looked notably similar to an explosion that happens when an airbag explodes. A video of such an incident could be viewed here.
- Initial reports of the injuries that resulted from the accident pointed to the driver of the Tesla and his two children being severely injured. Russian media outlet IXBT.com, for one, noted that Tretyakov was in “intensive care” due to the crash. Later reports would prove this to be false. Speaking with CrimeRussia, the Tesla owner noted that both of his legs were broken due to the accident, but his two children were “practically not injured.”
- Update: While CrimeRussia noted in its coverage of the incident that the Model 3 driver had two broken legs as a result of the crash, it appears that the news agency misquoted the Tesla owner’s statements. Vladimir Grinshpun, a native Russian speaker, noted in a message to Teslarati that the Tesla owner clearly stated during a video interview with the news agency that he had one broken leg and a broken nose due to the accident. A video of this interview could be accessed here.
- A video depicting what appeared to be Tretyakov hobbling away from his vehicle as his two children walked ahead of him has also been aired on Russian media outlet Russia 24.
- Being a Tesla crash, it was not surprising to note that several reports promptly related the crash to the potential use of Autopilot. Discussing the incident, longtime TMC member mongo noted that since Teslas in Russia are imported through a third party, there was likely no Navigate on Autopilot support in the area. Thus, functions of Autopilot would likely be limited to basic features such as lane-keeping.
- This was mentioned by Tretyakov himself, who noted that he was using a “driver-assist” feature and a “trimmed” version of Autopilot when the accident happened. The Tesla owner added that he was holding the wheel in the moments leading up to the crash, though he also admitted that he did not notice the parked tow truck on the road. Based on the video of the Tesla’s crash, it appears that either the vehicle or Tretyakov engaged the brakes just before the car hit the parked truck.
- Tesla is yet to issue a formal statement about the incident, though the electric car maker has recently published its most recent vehicle accident and fire data. Tesla notes that from 2012 – 2018, “there has been approximately one Tesla vehicle fire for every 170 million miles traveled. By comparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation shows that in the United States there is a vehicle fire for every 19 million miles traveled.” It should be noted that Tesla’s data set includes instances of vehicle fires caused by structure fires, arson, and other things unrelated to the vehicle, which account for about 15% of Tesla vehicle fires over this time period.

- This is the appalling moment a Tesla car erupts in flames and explodes after a crash caused by an 'autopilot failure.'
- The plug-in car rammed into a tow truck on Moscow’s ring road, leaving businessman driver Alexey Tretiyakov, 41, with a broken leg and his children suffering bruises and concussion.
- He and his passengers escaped the car before was engulfed in the flames.
- Alexey Tretiyakov's Tesla Mark 3 smashed into the side of a tow truck and burst into flames. The 41-year-old businessman had been driving with his children in the backseat and using the car's 'driver assistant' autopilot feature
- Tretyakov, pictured above at hospital in Moscow, suffered a broken leg in the collision and chest injuries. Luckily, he said, his children were unharmed bar concussion and bruises and he hopes they'll be discharged soon
- They were rushed to hospital.
- There was heavy traffic around the car when it erupted into an inferno with several small explosions and black smoke.
- The moment was caught by another driver.
- A law enforcement source said: 'The Tesla was probably driving on autopilot and couldn’t recognise the tow truck in front of it, after which it caught fire.'
- The inferno began with a few small explosions followed by billowing black smoke erupting from the chassis of the luxury four-door all electric sedan
- The Tesla Mark iii received an all round five star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The possibility of having a rollover is supposed to be just 6.6 per cent, according to the crash tests conducted in its development. Tesla chairman Elon Musk has championed it as the safest car ever
- A report by Channel 112 stated: 'The auto driving robot did not recognise an obstacle on the road….so the Tesla hit the tow truck at the high speed and caught fire.'
- But the driver admitted he was holding the wheel on the ring road, known as MKAD, as automaker Tesla tells drivers they must.
- 'I was going along Moscow Ring road in the left lane with a speed of 100 km per hour (62mph) and did not notice a parked Gazel tow truck,' he said told REN TV.
- 'My Tesla Model 3 hit the tow truck with its left side and caught fire.
- 'It was not on full-scale automatic control - in Model 3 there is the function "driver's assistant" only, so I was holding the wheel.'
- Tretyakov, head of AriCapital company, said all three were wearing belts.
- 'I needed help to get out of my car because one of my legs was broken.'
- According to Tretiyakov, he was travelling at around 62 mph on the Moscow ring road when he smashed into the parked tow truck on the side of the road. Police officers have blamed the auto-pilot 'robot' in the Tesla for not failing to see the truck
- He also suffered a chest injury in the smash.
- He was being treated in hospital but hoped his children would be discharged.
- The accident was at around 9pm Moscow time.
- The tow truck was aiding a Lada which breakdown on the highway.

- A Tesla vehicle involved in a collision burst into flames and exploded on a highway near Moscow last night, local media reported. The occupants were slightly injured, but the car is toast.
- The model of the car is not clear from reporting, but seems to be either a Model S or Model 3. It was being driven by a 41-year-old Russian man, who had his children with him. He had reportedly engaged a drive assist feature (though not necessarily Autopilot) and had his hands on the wheel when he crashed into a tow truck in the left lane.
- The driver broke his legs and the kids got away with just bruises, Reuters reported, but the car wasn’t so lucky. Some time after the crash the car caught fire, and shortly after that a pair of explosions occurred within its body, as seemingly captured (I was unable to directly confirm this) in the following video posted by someone in traffic going the other direction:

- Firefighters soon arrived and put out the flames. The circumstances of this crash are still unclear, and there will no doubt be an investigation, as there are for any serious issues like this. I’ve asked Tesla for more details and will update this post if I hear back.
- While cars crash and catch fire on a fairly regular basis, Teslas have a rare but recurring problem of bursting into flame after a crash, or even spontaneously. The unique dangers of battery-based vehicles are of course interesting, but the sensational nature of reports around them can also give a false idea of those dangers. Tesla cars are in crashes about as often as other vehicles, but fires are rare.
- Whether Autopilot was involved is also not clear. The drive-assist mode the driver was using may simply have been cruise control or the like, and the driver told papers that he didn’t notice the tow truck. Until more facts are known, speculation is fruitless.

- He later said the car had been in “drive assistance mode”, in which enhanced safety features are enabled but the driver’s hands remain on the wheel, and that he had failed to see the truck.
- Tesla’s website states: “Current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.”
- However, the company also says its automatic emergency breaking feature is “designed to automatically engage the brakes to reduce the impact of an unavoidable frontal collision”.
- It is not clear whether Mr Tretyakov’s car automatically slowed itself before colliding with the truck.
- A law enforcement source said: “The Tesla was probably driving on autopilot and couldn’t recognise the tow truck in front of it, after which it caught fire.”
- ENGULFED IN SMOKE
- Video of the initial explosion, captured by another driver, saw black smoke engulfing passing cars as well as smaller explosions coming from within the Tesla.
- Tretyakov, head of investment management company AriCapital, told Russian network REN TV he had been holding the steering wheel, as Tesla tells drivers they must, and had not seen the parked vehicle.
- “I was going along Moscow ring road in the left lane with a speed of 100kph (62mph) and did not notice a parked GAZelle tow truck,” he said.
