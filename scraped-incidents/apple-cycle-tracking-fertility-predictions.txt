- Apple's fertility tracking feature uses sensors to measure the fluctuations in body temperature which correlate with a person's ovulation cycle to help users know if and when they're ovulating.
- Introduced in September 2022, the feature builds on Apple's existing Health app and Cycle Tracking app, and comes as part of Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple's watchOS 9 and iOS 16 operating systems.
- Despite Apple's focus on privacy and the fact that its health products are end-to-end encrypted, some commentators criticised the company for introducing its fertility tracker shortly after the US Supreme Court over-turned the 1973 Wade vs Roe ruling that legalised abortion across the US. In theory, the ruling makes it possible for law enforcement and other public authorities to access women's cycle tracking data.
- Others are concerned that Apple's fertility tracking, and similar technologies, can be easily be misconstrued as birth control, resulting in unwanted pregnancies. Organisations claiming people can use their product to avoid becoming pregnant require sign-off from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
- Apple launched its native machine learning-based Cycle Tracking app with iOS 13 and WatchOS6 in September 2019. A Privacy International investigation had previusly discovered that a number of period-tracking apps were sharing sensitive information with Facebook.

- Your Apple Watch Series 8 or Apple Watch Ultra can use wrist temperature data to estimate the likely day of ovulation after it has occurred and improve period predictions.
- 
- When an estimate of when you likely ovulated is available, you’ll receive a notification on your Apple Watch or iPhone. In the Health app on iPhone or Cycle Tracking app on Apple Watch, your ovulation estimate appears as a light purple oval in your fertile window.
- Apple Watch Series 8 or Apple Watch Ultra uses wrist temperature data to detect the biphasic shift, which is an increase in temperature that often occurs after ovulation. Advanced algorithms use wrist temperature data and logged cycle data to estimate the day ovulation likely occurred.
- Various factors may have an impact on the availability of ovulation estimates.

- When the new Apple Watch was unveiled this fall, it came with an intriguing feature: the ability to estimate whether someone had ovulated by measuring their temperature from their wrist. Apple said that the feature could help people understand their bodies, or help people know the optimal time to try to get pregnant. It also warned that this information should not be used as a form of birth control. Problem is, Apple says one thing and people do another.
- The new feature, which is available on the Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, comes at a time when similar tech has emerged as a replacement for birth control. It’s a trend that has led some medical experts to worry that fertility predictions provided by tech companies could be misused, resulting in unwanted pregnancies by people who don’t understand how complicated fertility can be. And those fears are compounded by recent restrictions on abortion rights in the United States that make it not only more difficult to terminate unwanted pregnancies but also make collecting and storing data about one’s menstrual cycles a precarious or even dangerous choice.
- “Having more information about your body and what it’s doing can be a very good thing,” says Kate White, a practicing gynecologist and family planning researcher at the Boston University School of Medicine. “Information without context is dangerous. And I worry that, because the company doesn’t want people to use this actively for fertility, they’re not going to provide information on how to use it for that.” That information gap could send people to do their own sleuthing, using unofficial resources like Facebook groups or TikTok, where murky information in the influencer realm can falsely conflate cycle tracking with foolproof contraception.
- Fertility tracking is a birth control method long used by those practicing religions that ban hormonal birth control, and it's even promoted by the Catholic church. But more people are exploring fertility-awareness methods as they push back against the pill as the default method of birth control. Hormonal birth control can come with significant side effects and, on rare occasions, can cause deadly blood clots. Some holistic health providers argue that experiencing ovulation, which hormonal birth control blocks, has significant health benefits, but the idea is not widely held by medical professionals.
- That skepticism, and an overall lagging investment in women’s health care, has fueled a boom in femtech. But the mobile apps that lead this market, such as Natural Cycles and Daysy, serve a niche customer base and have their own costs. The Daysy is a $320 thermometer that takes basal body temperature data and analyzes it to predict ovulation. Natural Cycles is an app that calculates likely fertility based on temperature inputs and has an annual subscription fee of $99. The Apple Watch is now bringing similar ovulation tech to a new audience.
- Apple says on its website that “cycle tracking should not be used as a form of birth control” and that ovulation estimates are only that: estimates. It provides no guarantee that the tech can say with certainty whether ovulation has occurred, and says it should not be used to diagnose medical conditions that affect ovulation, like polycystic ovary syndrome. When asked for comment, Apple deferred to publicly available videos and web pages about the tech.

- Here’s how it works: The watch must be worn overnight to measure body temperature every five seconds, according to the company. Body temperature drops slightly right before ovulation and rises during it. The watch’s algorithm measures those shifts and can notify a person several days after they may have ovulated.
- But Apple’s Health app, available on older Apple Watch models and iPhones, has already offered cycle tracking and fertility predictions, where users input their menstrual cycles and physical symptoms. The app can give predictions, not just retroactive estimates, on the days people may be fertile. (Apple also says this feature should not be used as a form of birth control). Predictions made using these forms of analysis are similar to what’s known as the rhythm method, which has long been used to prevent pregnancy. It has a high failure rate when compared to hormonal and barrier forms of contraception, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
- And while period-tracking apps have existed for at least a decade, mobile apps with algorithms that use temperature data to predict ovulation are more recent. Natural Cycles is cleared to advertise itself as birth control by the US Food and Drug Administration and in Europe, but Daysy is not. Another app, Clue Birth Control, also received FDA clearance.
- Despite different levels of regulatory approval, all these apps and services are different forms of the catchall phrase “fertility awareness method,” which consists of tracking a menstrual cycle and sometimes using physiological indicators, like temperature, to predict ovulation. People can then have unprotected sex based on that mapping, whether they are planning a pregnancy or trying to avoid one.
- Even if apps caution against using their algorithmic predictions for birth control, “the reality is that people do,” says Rebecca G. Simmons, a fertility researcher with the University of Utah who previously worked on Clue’s app. “A lot of people backfill: ‘If this can be used in one way, then it can be used in another way,’” she says. “There’s not enough body and health literacy in our population to really understand that that’s not true. It’s a problem across fertility tech, but Apple is just the largest and most visible.”
- Simmons also says that integrations like the ones Apple has in its new watch could begin showing up more. “I think it’s going to be more and more common that people get a side of femtech with their normal tech,” she says. That’s good for inclusivity, but could be bad for public understanding of how the technology works.
- The silver lining is that putting ovulation trackers on more wrists—from Apple and others like Fitbit—could provide more data about how people use fertility tech and how well fertility awareness works. However, this advancement coincides with new concerns around collecting fertility data. The US Supreme Court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade in June has led states to criminalize abortion, and law enforcement has used people’s search histories and texts about seeking abortions as evidence to prosecute them in some cases. Any cycle-tracking tech, particularly an app that points to changes in ovulation, has the potential to be weaponized against someone accused of illegally terminating a pregnancy.
- Apple says that all health data is encrypted end to end for those who use two-factor authentication in iCloud and that data on a device is encrypted and can be accessed only with a password. That’s an improvement on other period- and fertility-tracking apps, some of which have tracked data that would put users at risk. But privacy experts have concerns that those protections may not be absolute.
- “It’s convenient to have these types of apps,” says Jennifer Chin, a fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. “But I just want everyone who is using it to know the potential drawbacks of using natural family planning, and also that there is national concern for people’s privacy.”

- It checks whether you’re swimming the backstroke or with a kickboard. It checks if you’re buying spaghetti at the grocery store. It also checks for temperature changes to estimate when you’re ovulating. At least, that’s how Apple advertises its newly released Apple Watch Series 8—the latest iteration in the company’s smart wearable devices.
- Apple has built its brand on privacy, and there are many good reasons for this perception. Years ago it built end-to-end encryption into iMessage, for example, which ensures only the sender and receiver can see a message. It famously touted its security focus when it refused to help the FBI open the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone (although it maintains an FBI relationship). And unlike Google, Facebook, and some other tech giants, it doesn’t make most of its revenue from online advertising.
- But having a pro-privacy brand doesn’t eradicate real privacy questions. If the company is collecting deeply invasive data in the first place, then corporate goodwill is the only thing preventing abuse—and corporate goodwill, whether Apple’s or that of any other company, can only go so far.
- Smart watches and menstrual cycles are hardly the first time this problem has arisen. In April 2021, Apple released the AirTag, a portable location tracker that it said “helps keep track of and find the items that matter most with Apple’s Find My app.” The company put the product’s privacy and security features front and center. The second sentence of Apple’s press release stated that AirTags can “help locate a lost item, all while keeping location data private and anonymous with end-to-end encryption.” Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of worldwide iPhone product marketing, emphasized the AirTag’s “built-in privacy and security features.” Protecting users’ information was portrayed as part and parcel of the company’s ethos.
- Immediately after Apple released AirTags, however, data privacy experts warned that stalkers could weaponize the product. “AirTags are easy to hide in a target’s bag or car,” Albert Fox Cahn and Eva Galperin wrote, “giving an abuser an easy way to track their location.” Apple had created a mechanism to warn people with iPhones about unknown AirTags in their vicinity, the authors wrote, but if you don’t check your iPhone, or if you don’t have an iPhone (like half of America), you’re out of luck. The sound AirTags make when separated from their owner for 72 hours, Cahn and Galperin added, was only 60 decibels, “about the same volume as a dishwasher or casual conversation.” Around the same time, a Washington Post reporter tested all this by allowing a colleague to follow him—and found the audible alarm unnoticeable.
- Apple responded in July 2021 by changing the beep interval, so AirTags would make a sound if apart from their owner’s device for more than eight to 24 hours. (The beep would be timed randomly in that window.) It also said it would develop an Android application people could download to look for unknown AirTags nearby (which it did, called Tracker Detect). But the grave risks persisted: As Galperin pointed out to the Post, someone could simply use a person’s own AirTag to stalk them, which would not trigger the iPhone alerts. An abusive individual with access to a person’s phone could also simply turn off “item safety alerts” in that person’s iPhone settings. Defending its product, Apple kept leaning into its privacy narrative. In February it said “we design our products to provide a great experience, but also with safety and privacy in mind” and noted that it reminds people when they set up an AirTag to not stalk others (literally).
- Despite this stern warning, numerous women have reported people stalking them with AirTags since the product’s launch. In many cases, this involved an ex or person already familiar with their life, which also increases the likelihood an abusive individual has access to a targeted person’s device. For all that Apple might cooperate with law enforcement on investigations into AirTag-related stalking, the product remains on the shelf, and serious privacy and physical safety threats persist.
- Apple’s recent decision to embed fertility tracking in the Watch Series 8 has a similar flavor of leaning on a pro-privacy brand to sideline real privacy concerns. The watches, according to the company, will track people’s body temperatures through two sensors to predict ovulation. Users who already track their cycle through the iPhone’s Health app or the Apple Watch’s Cycle Tracking App can also get menstrual cycle deviation alerts. Executives have pitched the monitoring technology as a pregnancy support system, too: “If you’re trying to conceive, knowing if and when you ovulated can inform your family planning with your health care provider,” Sumbul Desai, Apple’s vice president of health, said at its launch event.
- The fertility and cycle tracking both come with some privacy and security protections, such as encrypting health data synced to iCloud both in transit and on servers. Apple highlighted this fact when debuting its new devices, and that is certainly a good move. [Update, Sept. 24, 2022: After publication of this article, Apple said in an email that that phones locked with a passcode encrypt all Health app fitness and health data (but not the user’s Medical ID), and that if you use Cycle Tracking with two-factor authentication enabled, health data synced to iCloud is end-to-end encrypted, where Apple does not have the decryption key and cannot read it.] But it doesn’t change the fact that a multinational technology company—with, by some estimates, more than 100 million watch users worldwide—is proposing tracking period information for people with the capacity to get pregnant. It doesn’t change the fact that said company is doing so, and thought it was a good idea to do so, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the United States and an even faster-growing surveillance threat to women and other people. Some Apple customers might enjoy this ovulation-tracking feature, and they might choose to use it even with knowledge of the collected data’s sensitivity. At the same time, companies have struggled with responding to the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade and with handling questions about potential law enforcement requests for pregnancy-related data. Despite this uncertainty, Apple is rolling out a tracking feature that might exacerbate these risks.
- Apple’s investments in privacy and cybersecurity protections are better for users than little investment at all, and the company has been more vocal than some peers about privacy issues. But these technical measures don’t eliminate the always-present risk that a company is hacked—and highly sensitive information that it didn’t have to collect in the first place, like menstrual health data, is leaked and exploited. (While the Apple Watch appears to allow users to keep health data on their device, people with both a watch and an iPhone will almost guaranteed want to sync the data through iCloud, especially given the iPhone’s frequent prompts for users to make iCloud backups.) Privacy brand narratives and cybersecurity investments also don’t eliminate the risk that law enforcement agencies, such as those enforcing anti-abortion laws, approach a company with legal demands to access health data. It also doesn’t change the fact that highly sensitive information about a person’s body is collected in the first place—a step often glossed over when the public and policy conversation takes collecting data as a given, and spends the rest of the discussion arguing over how to store, transfer, and use it.
- Narratives of “it’s fine if we collect it, because we’re pro-privacy” may be grounded in differences between how that company and its competitors handle users’ information. But it obscures the fact that harms can still occur, that companies don’t have to collect data just because they find it financially lucrative, and that people are still relying on corporate goodwill to prevent data abuse. Decisions like tracking people’s menstrual information still generate serious risks—and a corporate privacy brand doesn’t change that fact.

- By  Nicole Wetsman
- Apple Watch Series 8 will give users a better estimate of when they ovulated based on data from new temperature sensors.
- Using two sensors on the Apple Watch Series 8, the built-in menstrual cycle tracking app will check users’ temperature at the wrist every five seconds overnight. This should allow for ovulation tracking since body temperature changes over the course of the menstrual cycle and rises in response to ovulation.
- watchOS 9 and iOS 16 will also include changes to the cycle tracking app that flag any abnormalities in a user’s menstrual cycle based on the data they input about their periods. Deviations from someone’s normal cycle — like more spotting than usual — can be a signal of health conditions like fibroids or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple, said during the launch event.
- Apple is pitching its ovulation detection feature as a way to help people who are trying to get pregnant. “If you’re trying to conceive, knowing if and when you ovulated can inform your family planning with your healthcare provider,” Desai said.
- People who use temperature information as a way to predict when they’re most likely to get pregnant usually have to take their temperature manually. Apple Watch would do that automatically — similarly to how the Oura Ring collects temperature and other types of user data to predict when someone might start their period.
- This type of temperature-based cycle tracking and ovulation detection is also often used as a way to prevent pregnancy. It can work well if it’s done correctly, but it’s tricky to get right and isn’t a good method for people with irregular cycles.
- Apple’s feature can’t be sold as a way to prevent pregnancy because it isn’t Food and Drug Administration-approved as a birth control. But the new features are inching closer to similar tech that is allowed to be marketed as birth control. For example, the app Natural Cycles was controversially cleared by the FDA in 2018 as a birth control. It uses body temperature and cycle tracking information to predict the times of a month when someone is most likely to become pregnant and lets them know to use condoms or abstain from sex.
- Natural Cycles also has FDA clearance to use information from wearable devices to make its predictions. It currently accepts temperature information from the Oura Ring. Natural Cycles has discussed the potential to pull in information from the Apple Watch as well, spokesperson Lauren Hanafin said in an email to The Verge. The company would first have to run validation tests before that could happen, and the use case would depend on how accurate it is, she said.
- It’s also notable that Apple is adding cycle tracking features — which could theoretically be used to tell if someone is or has been pregnant — in the few months after the Supreme Court ended federal protection for abortion. Experts haven’t seen cycle tracking information used to prosecute people suspected of having abortions in places where it’s no longer legal, but that’s still a possible risk.
- Cycle tracking data on Apple devices is encrypted, and Apple cannot decrypt or read it, Desai said during the event. “Your health data is yours and yours alone,” she said.

URL: https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/19/23408923/apple-fertility-cycle-app-research-rigour-pregnancy
- By  Nicole Wetsman
- Apple is very careful with the language it’s using around the new, juiced-up fertility and cycle tracking features on the Apple Watch Series 8. It can “inform your family planning” if you’re trying to conceive, the company said in the product announcement. It can predict ovulation but only retrospectively.
- The company isn’t making any claims that people could use the features to avoid becoming pregnant, which would take sign-off from the Food and Drug Administration. But people don’t just use cycle tracking tech in the ways companies say they should, says Rebecca Simmons, a researcher and fertility awareness specialist at the University of Utah. “Even if Apple says this is not to be used as birth control, which they do, people are going to utilize it as birth control,” she says.
- That’s why experts like Simmons say that Apple’s cycle tracking features are a missed opportunity for the tech giant to build out a more robust fertility tracking tool. More and more people are interested in keeping tabs on their fertility and on non-hormonal methods of birth control. But there hasn’t been investment from medical research to match that interest — leaving a gap that technology companies are trying to fill. Experts in fertility tracking and reproductive health, though, say that some of those efforts don’t have the rigor to meet the needs of the moment.
- “But this is a half-baked amount of literacy for people to utilize in a way that is safe”
- “I think people who menstruate can benefit tremendously from having body literacy, and having a company like this say, yes, we agree that this is important and valuable, and we acknowledge people want this information — that’s really, really great,” Simmons says. “But this is a half-baked amount of literacy for people to utilize in a way that is safe.”
- Apple’s cycle tracking feature predicts when a user might get their period based on information about previous periods and cycle length, according to the company website. Then, it subtracts 13 days from the estimated start of the user’s next cycle to find their fertile window, which the feature says runs for six days. Users can manually add a positive ovulation test result, which would adjust the predictions. Apple Watch Series 8 or Apple Watch Ultra users can add ovulation information calculated from the watches’ temperature sensors. Users can also get notifications if the app detects a “cycle deviation,” but it’s not available to people who have factors like hormonal birth control affecting their cycle.
- Apple’s cycle tracking “Instructions for Use” say that the period prediction and ovulation estimates were tested in 260 and 226 users, respectively. The features met “pre-specified clinical endpoints,” according to the document. Apple spokesperson Zaina Khachadourian referred The Verge to those instructions and did not say if the company has any plans to publish data on the features.
- Simmons says that method for predicting the days when someone might be fertile doesn’t align with best practices in fertility tracking. (Simmons helped develop the method that period tracking app Clue uses on its Food and Drug Administration-cleared birth control).
- Simmons hasn’t done research on the Apple feature, but she says that the fertile window shouldn’t be that short, for one — the length of a fertile window varies so widely that most methods would give a longer stretch. Subtracting 13 days from a cycle start date also doesn’t give enough information to find a fertile window, Simmons says.
- “That’s where the majority of apps and technologies fall — they’re fertility-adjacent, but they’re not really adhering to the full spectrum of all of these different physiological principles,” she says. “People are getting this information, but the information they’re getting is likely incomplete, at best, or wildly inaccurate at worst.” That’s risky if people are using that information to make high-stakes decisions around when to have sex to either increase or decrease chances of pregnancy.
- Apple, in particular, has such a market saturation and reputation for reliability that people might assume its products are more rigorous than they actually are, says Suzanne Bell, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies contraception and reproductive health. It’s a potential issue around cycle and fertility tracking apps generally, she says. “There’s a lot of opportunity for misunderstanding and overinterpretation of the validity or accuracy of the information these apps are providing.”
- Apple does include warnings in the Health app and instructions for use that people should not use fertile windows as a form of birth control, but users have to navigate through multiple screens to find it.
- People do use cycle tracking apps and products to avoid pregnancy, even though they’re not intended for that purpose. In one small study of fertility tracking apps, 4 percent of people said they used the apps for contraception. It’s not clear how widespread this practice is, but doctors hear about it anecdotally.
- People do use cycle-tracking apps and products to avoid pregnancy
- “More than a few patients have told me they’re using them in that way,” says Rachel Urrutia, a fertility awareness expert and reproductive epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
- Two tech companies, Natural Cycles and Clue, have developed and tested apps that are intended as birth control. Both ran studies that found the products could effectively prevent pregnancy if used correctly. The Food and Drug Administration cleared Natural Cycles as birth control in 2018 — which was a controversial decision — and cleared Clue’s birth control in 2021.
- Urrutia says that these two birth control apps aren’t perfect and that there are elements in each she’s pushed back on in the past. (She doesn’t have a formal relationship with either). But she likes that they’re transparent about their methods and that they’ve done the work to test their products and publish their results. “They’re at least trying to share their data,” she says.
- Apple, on the other hand, has only released minimal data around its fertile window and period prediction feature.
- “Apple isn’t saying that this method is to be used for birth control. So technically, they’re not in the same realm of responsibility,” Simmons says. But they should take on some of that responsibility if they’re going to make predictions based on user data and not just compile that data, she says. She doesn’t think companies should be giving users a fertile window unless they’re validating their approach and sticking closely to best practices around fertility awareness.
- “I think it’s when tech companies step in and say, ‘This is what’s happening to you,’ that they merit more scrutiny — and possibly more critique,” Simmons says.
- Tech companies like Apple add features to their products that people are interested in, and they’ve identified a pent-up demand for information about fertility. It’s an area that historically hasn’t been taken as seriously by the medical establishment, Urrutia says. “I finished an OB-GYN residency training without understanding how to use fertility-based methods,” she says.
- There hasn’t been major research investment into fertility awareness
- There hasn’t been major research investment into fertility awareness, even though it can be an effective tool to prevent pregnancy when used correctly. Doctors aren’t as able to help patients who are interested in monitoring their own fertility. “They haven’t been sexy to research, and they haven’t been sexy to fund because they’re really nitty gritty, and they’re a lot of work for people to do,” Simmons says.
- That lack of investment on the medical side has left a knowledge gap that’s been all too tempting for big tech companies with health and wellness ambitions to fill. These companies are founded in part on the goal of making complex and detailed tasks simple and automated for their users — and they can move faster with more funding than the medical establishment. They’re able, then, to quickly push out features that promise to track fertility easily. But they’re not disclosing the research they based the features on, they’re not publishing their data, and they’re not opening up their programs to outside scrutiny.
- Tech companies have the money — and the data — to invest in the research that could give people a better understanding of how well fertility awareness works for contraception and conception. That type of work could also help lend more legitimacy to a field that’s been under-evaluated.
- “I would love to see Apple use their resources to really rigorously evaluate this sort of feature,” Bell says. Then, people could be more confident — or have more information — in making a decision on whether to use a product like a smartwatch to help them avoid pregnancy or to try and become pregnant. “It would be great for people’s reproductive self-determination and autonomy to have this feature. But it needs to be done well and evaluated rigorously,” she says.
- If the tools are effective, it could be a way to help meet the needs of people who want to build a more detailed understanding of their bodies. It’s good to see big companies like Apple talking vocally about those issues. But the stakes are high, Bell says.
- “I think, on the whole, it’s potentially great that tech companies are interested in this space and meeting this need,” she says. “I just hope that they do it with the respect and rigor that is needed because this is people’s fertility and people’s lives that could be significantly impacted by reliance on these apps.”

- An earlier version of this article misstated that the Natural Cycles app was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It was cleared by the FDA, not approved. The article has been corrected.
- With a menstrual-tracking app, you can see when your periods and fertile days start and end. And, because these apps leave a digital trail, other people can see, too.
- With 13 states poised to ban abortion after a Friday Supreme Court decision overturning the right to get one, many worry that data from period apps could become evidence of a crime. Some people are deleting the apps; others are sending data deletion requests to the companies that run them. And, while actual reproductive health data isn’t the only way law enforcement or other prying eyes could infer someone had an abortion, cutting down on personal data-sharing could become habit for women in post-Roe v. Wade America absent action from tech companies or the government to protect them.
- If you want to track your menstrual cycle without sharing that information with companies, your employer or potentially law enforcement, here’s what to keep in mind, privacy and health experts say.
- Your phone could reveal if you’ve had an abortion
- Menstrual-tracking apps help people keep tabs on their periods, ovulation and pregnancies. What they don’t always do is keep that information to themselves.
- Research into the privacy practices of popular period-tracking apps has consistently raised concerns. A 2021 report from the International Digital Accountability Council (IDAC) found period trackers sending unencrypted personal information or sharing data with third parties without fully disclosing that in their privacy policies. The period app Flo got in trouble with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) last year for “deceptive” practices around its data sharing. Flo says it now “does not share health data” with any third party. IDAC also referred the app Premom to the FTC and other regulators for alleged inconsistencies between its privacy policy and practices, said IDAC president Quentin Palfrey.
- Premom didn’t reply to a request for comment.
- Natural Cycles, the first-ever app cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for birth control, can collect “sensitive information” linked to your identity, according to its listing in the Apple App Store.
- “Protecting user data has always been a top priority for Natural Cycles and as sensitive data becomes more sensitive, we’ll continue to make sure every user’s data is safe with us. We have never — and never will — sell user data. And as we face potential legislation changes, we will be evolving our privacy policy to make sure our users are protected against unimaginable potential legal situations,” Natural Cycles co-founder and CEO Elina Berglund said in a statement.
- Unlike details you share with a health-care provider, the health information you turn over to an app is not protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). That means it could end up in the hands of data brokers — who collect and sell hoards of personal data — insurers, employers and even law enforcement.
- Code words and fake names: The low-tech ways women protect their privacy on pregnancy apps
- Right now, it’s incredibly difficult for people at home to evaluate the privacy of different period apps and understand where their data is flowing behind the scenes, IDAC’s Palfrey said.
- There are some secure apps such as Euki, which claim to have stronger privacy protections, according to Farah Diaz-Tello, senior counsel and legal director at If/When/How, a legal advocacy organization. (Indeed, Euki says it doesn’t collect any personal or other data.) If you’re considering an app, read the privacy policies — can this app share data with “partners,” “affiliates” or “third parties?” You want apps that encrypt your data and store it on your device instead of in the cloud, if possible.
- Any digital data stored on your phone could still become a liability if law enforcement obtains your device. If you’re worried about law-enforcement access to your phone in general, use a passcode instead of fingerprint or Face ID to lock it. “Users should be careful about sharing information with third-party apps that they wouldn’t want getting into the wrong hands,” Palfrey said.
- Luckily, third-party apps aren’t the only options for tracking your cycle on a phone. Both Apple and Google have period tracking options built into their mobile health apps that tout more privacy protections than the apps sold on their app stores.
- On iPhones, the Health app has basic cycle tracking that includes period and fertility predictions. It can record sensitive information about your body, including sexual activity, pregnancy test results and various symptoms. The data is encrypted. There is an option to back it up to iCloud, however, as with anything encrypted in this manner, the company does have the ability to turn data over to law enforcement unless you have two-factor authentication turned on for your Apple ID, according to Apple. You also have the option to turn off Health access in your iCloud settings, but be sure to save a copy on your phone. Apple also offers the ability to sync the data with third-party apps, but the same precautions apply here as when using any outside app.
- Google doesn’t have the same kind of secure health app built in. What it does offer is Google Fit, launched in 2014, which includes options for tracking data like menstruation and ovulation test results, but Google’s privacy policy isn’t as clear on how it’s protected or used. Approach it with the same caution you would third-party apps.
- Google privacy settings to change now
- Somewhere between a full-featured app and piece of paper, spreadsheets that are stored on your device and don’t link to the cloud are a private option for period-tracking. Spreadsheets can include formulas that do some of the calculations for you.
- Any spreadsheet where you can input the dates of the first and last day of your period should do the trick. If you’re using the sheet to track ovulation and fertility, leave room to note your temperature and body fluids, as well. Planned Parenthood has a guide for anyone new to these methods of fertility tracking, known as fertility awareness methods (FAMs).
- The Internet has downloadable templates for period-tracking in Excel. The safest way to use one of these spreadsheets is to save it on your computer or phone and make it password protected so that only you can open it.
- You use online calendars to track everything else in your life, why not your period? Calendars on your computer are usually synced between multiple devices and may not be the safest place to put sensitive health information. Because they are not using data for targeted ads, they can be a step up from some apps. However, if you use one to track your period and are worried, you can use code or emoji to mark the dates. You can also turn a spreadsheet into a calendar for all the sweet formatting with a bit more security.
- When in doubt, you can always track your cycle in a notebook or analog calendar, if you’re not worried about someone close to you finding it.
- “The only equipment you need is a paper, pen, calendar and thermometer,” said Karen Jefferson, director of midwifery practice at the American College of Nurse-Midwives. “You can figure out all about your cycle and your periods of fertility, and nobody can take your data.”
- She recommends marking the first and last day of your periods to get an idea of your average cycle over time, and even write down when you have sex and whether it’s protected.
- People don’t have to turn over their phones and other devices if law enforcement asks, experts say. And those who want to talk to friends and family about their reproductive health or search the Internet for extra information can opt for encrypted messengers and privacy browsers.
- Which messaging apps and browsers are most private?
- If you’ve been using a period-tracking app and are concerned about it storing your data, you can submit a data deletion request. This right applies only to people who live in states with extra privacy protection, such as California, but some companies say they’ll honor these requests from people anywhere.

- Even before the supreme court decision to overturn Roe v Wade, the trend to ditch the apps began amid fears of prosecution
- Many American women in recent days have deleted period tracking apps from their cellphones, amid fears the data collected by the apps could be used against them in future criminal cases in states where abortion has become illegal.
- The trend already started last month when a draft supreme court opinion that suggested the court was set to overturn Roe v Wade was leaked, and has only intensified since the court on Friday revoked the federal right to abortion.
- These concerns are not baseless. As with various other apps, cycle trackers collect, retain and at times share some of their users’ data. In a state where abortion is a crime, prosecutors could request information collected by these apps when building a case against someone. “If they are trying to prosecute a woman for getting an illegal abortion, they can subpoena any app on their device, including period trackers,” said Sara Spector, a Texas-based criminal defense attorney, and ex-prosecutor.
- “But every company has their individual storage and privacy policy about how they use and how long they store data,” Spector added.
- Cycle trackers are popular for a reason. Nearly a third of American women have been using them, according to a 2019 survey published by the Kaiser Family Foundation. They have helped make women’s lives easier in many ways, from family planning and detecting early signs of health issues to choosing the perfect time for a holiday.
- A 2019 study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found that 79% of health apps available through the Google Play store that were related to medicine, including apps that help manage drugs, adherence, medicines, or prescribing information, regularly shared user data and were “far from transparent”. But many of the big players have made progress over the past years.
- Two of the most popular period trackers in the US, Flo and Clue, have more than 55 million users combined. The Berlin-based app Clue said it was “committed to protecting” users’ private health data and that it was operating under strict European GDPR laws. The company’s website says the app collects device data, event and usage data, in addition to a user’s IP address, health and sensitive data it may use for the purpose of improving the app, the services, and preventing abusive use of its service. But Clue does not track users’ precise location, and says it does not store sensitive personal data without a user’s explicit permission. The company also tweeted that it would have a “primary legal duty under European law” not to disclose any private health data and it would “not respond to any disclosure request or attempted subpoena of their users’ health data by US authorities”.
- But just because data is being processed by a European company, doesn’t mean that it is entirely immune from US prosecution, said Lucie Audibert, a lawyer at Privacy International, a global NGO that researches, litigates and advocates against abuses of technology and data by governments and corporations.
- “The fact that GDPR applies is not that relevant in this case. When it comes to a legitimate legal request from US authorities European companies usually comply. Also, a European company may be hosting data outside the EU, making it subject to different legal frameworks and cross-border agreements,” Audibert added. She also stressed that using a Europe-based app won’t protect women from the courts requesting data from them directly. But it can be a slightly better option than using a US-based one because US companies are more easily compelled to comply with American authorities and courts’ requests. Enforcement is more difficult against European ones.
- Flo has come under fire for sharing its users’ data before. The company says on its website it only uses data “for research activities” and that it only uses “de-identified or aggregated data, which cannot be associated” with specific users. But an investigative piece by the Wall Street Journal has found that the app informed Facebook when a user was on their period or if they intended to get pregnant. In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reached a settlement with Flo. Under the settlement, Flo must undergo an independent review of its privacy policy and obtain user permissions before sharing personal health information. Flo did not admit any wrongdoing.
- On Friday, Flo announced that it will soon be launching an “Anonymous mode” that can help keep users’ data safe in any circumstances.
- The company did not respond to a request for comment.
- A relatively new, astrology-focused period tracker, Stardust, became the most downloaded free app on iOS in the days after the supreme court’s decision. Stardust’s Twitter bio says it is a “privacy first period tracking app”. But as Vice News reported, the company stated in its privacy policy that if authorities ask for user data, it will comply, whether legally required to or not. It said that the data was “anonymized” and “encrypted”.
- “We may disclose your anonymized, encrypted information to third parties in order to protect the legal rights, safety and security of the company and the users of our services; enforce our terms of service; prevent fraud; and comply with or respond to law enforcement or a legal process or a request for cooperation by a government or other entity, whether or not legally required,” their privacy policy stated as of Monday.
- Following Vice’s request for comment, Stardust changed its privacy policy to omit the phrase about cooperating with law enforcement “whether or not legally required” to “when legally required”.
- Stardust did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
- Planned Parenthood encourages people to use their app Spot On. “People who want to track their periods and birth control always have the option to remain anonymous by using the Spot On app without creating an account,” the organization said in a statement. “This way, period or birth control data is only saved locally to a person’s phone and can be deleted at any time by deleting the app.”
- Third-party apps are not the only option when it comes to period trackers. Apple has a built-in cycle tracker in its Health app that offers more privacy than most external apps. With just a few steps, one can turn off the storing of their health data in iCloud, and it also has the option to store the encrypted data on their computer or phone.
- Evan Greer, deputy director of the non-profit advocacy group Fight for the Future, said the best way to protect sensitive health data was to only use apps that store data locally rather than in the cloud. “Because any app where a company [that could receive a subpoena] has access to their users’ data could make it vulnerable for a legal request.”
- Eva Blum-Dumontet, a tech policy consultant, said, “It is normal that in times of concern, people are looking differently at technology and apps that we trusted.
- “I think when there is a discourse around whether women should delete these apps, we have to think about why they use them in the first place,” Blum-Dumontet said. “These trackers help them manage menstrual cycle when they are experiencing pain.”
- Blum-Dumontet stressed that instead of asking users to change their behaviors, “it is period trackers that should change their practices”.
- “They should never have owned so much data in the first place. If they adopted practices like storing data locally and minimizing the data to what’s strictly necessary we wouldn’t be having this debate now. It’s not too late for them to do the right thing,” she said.
- “The companies that have been making a profit out of women’s bodies need to think very carefully about how they will protect their users,” she continued. “They haven’t all been the best in the past when it comes to data sharing. The only way they can survive in this market, the only way they can make themselves trustworthy is by improving their privacy policy and giving users more control over their data,” she said. “If any of these apps will be used in court against their users, it will not be good PR for them.”
- Melissa, a 27-year-old mother from Texas who is goingby only her first name to not jeopardize her employment, said she deleted the app because she fears that when she travels, her state could use her missed period data against her.
- “I will miss using the app so much. I have used it for so many things, like tracking my ovulation or predicting my mood changes. Sometimes I wake up feeling irritable, and I don’t know why until my app tells me that this could be normal at this point of my cycle,” she added. Melissa also says she would have loved to use it for future conceptions, but now she can’t.
- Although much of the warnings on Friday were focused on just period trackers these are not the only apps that can be used against users when it comes to criminal prosecution, experts warned.
- “Google Maps or a random game on your phone could just as easily be weaponized against someone as a menstrual tracking app,” Greer said. “While we need to educate each other and take precautions, it’s not OK to put the responsibility solely on individuals. Companies and lawmakers need to act immediately to protect people.”
- The concerns over period tracking data are part of a broader conversation about the amount of personal information smartphones collect. Women’s rights organizations all over the world are warning users to be more mindful of their digital presence, not just when it comes to period trackers.
- Cycle tracking apps can be hugely useful for many women, said Jonathan Lord, UK medical director for MSI Reproductive Choices. “But all data can be used against you.”
- According to Lord, this danger will remain until “we treat abortion like all other healthcare – regulated like all other medical procedures, but not criminalized”.

- The new Apple Watch Series 8 was released this month, and it includes one feature that, while useful for many, is so incredibly out of touch with this specific moment in time that it truly baffles the mind. Now, in September of 2022, is the time that Apple thought it would be a great idea to introduce an ovulation tracker.
- Here’s how it works, according to Apple: “Apple Watch Series 8 or Apple Watch Ultra uses wrist temperature data to detect the biphasic shift, which is an increase in temperature that often occurs after ovulation. Advanced algorithms use wrist temperature data and logged cycle data to estimate the day ovulation likely occurred.”
- The benefits here are obvious. For people trying to get pregnant, ovulation tracking is a necessary tool. If that can be as easy as enabling a pre-installed app, that’s going to be appealing to a lot of people.
- But there are also a lot of very real risks to this kind of technology, and while they’re not new, they may not have been as readily apparent to most people until recently.
- Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson WHO, which repealed constitutional protections for abortion, a nationwide spotlight tightened on our digital footprints and the ways in which they can, will, and already are being used to investigate and prosecute abortion. The idea that law enforcement would want to obtain our personal data from things like period and ovulation tracking apps (as well as text messages, emails, banking and payment apps, and so much more) is not hypothetical and it’s not an overreaction.
- Even before the fall of Roe v. Wade, personal data was being used to prosecute abortion in post-viability cases. Sometimes this happens when a person turns over their phone willingly, sometimes they have been subpoenaed. There are also reports of data brokers selling information regarding users’ visits to reproductive health and abortion clinics. Apple’s track record on giving up personal data isn’t as bad as, say, Facebook’s—which recently gave messages between a teenager and her mother to law enforcement, leading to them being charged with a number of misdemeanors and felonies related to inducing a medicated abortion—but this is extremely sensitive information that we’re just expected to trust a giant corporation to keep safe.
- Also, it’s been shown time and time again that everything laid out here applies to far more than just abortion. This data can be and has been used to investigate people who are actively trying to get pregnant. When that Nebraska teen and her mother had their Facebook messages turned over, police were investigating a potential miscarriage. Since the fall of Roe, people have been denied necessary medications for unrelated illnesses because their treatments have the potential to induce abortion. With that amount of fear and suspicion existing around this issue, the last thing we want is for more of our private information to be made available to those wishing to regulate our bodies.
- If this only affected people looking to get abortions, it would absolutely be bad enough—bad enough to sound every alarm, delete every app. But that’s not the case, and anyone who thinks this couldn’t possibly affect them is likely kidding themselves.
- I understand why Apple thought an ovulation tracker would be a natural progression from their existing cycle tracking technology. It’s also baffling that they saw the last few months of public discussion regarding the urgent drive to delete these sorts of apps and still thought this would be an appropriate time to introduce this feature into people’s lives.

- It’s estimated that millions of people in the U.S. use period-tracking apps to plan ahead, track when they are ovulating, and monitor other health effects. The apps can help signal when a period is late.
- This story also ran on PolitiFact. It can be republished for free.
- After Politico published on May 2 a draft opinion from the Supreme Court indicating that Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that guarantees the constitutional right to an abortion, would be overturned, people turned to social media. They were expressing concerns about the privacy of this information — especially for people who live in states with strict limits on abortion — and how it might be used against them.
- Many users recommended immediately deleting all personal data from period-tracking apps.
- “If you are using an online period tracker or tracking your cycles through your phone, get off it and delete your data,” activist and attorney Elizabeth McLaughlin said in a viral tweet. “Now.”
- Similarly, Eva Galperin, a cybersecurity expert, said the data could “be used to prosecute you if you ever choose to have an abortion.”
- That got us wondering — are these concerns warranted, and should people who use period-tracking apps delete the data or the app completely from their phones? We asked the experts.
- Is Your Period-Tracking App Data Shared?
- Privacy policies — specifically, whether the apps sell information to data brokers, use the data for advertising, share it for research, or keep it solely within the app — vary substantially among companies.
- “Does it encrypt? What’s its business model?” said Lucia Savage, chief privacy and regulatory officer for Omada Health, a digital therapeutics company. “If you can’t find terms of service or a privacy policy, don’t use that app.”
- Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing.
- Period-tracking apps are often not covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, though if the company is billing for health care services, it can be. Still, HIPAA doesn’t prevent the company from sharing de-identified data. If the app is free — and the company is monetizing the data — then “you are the product” and HIPAA does not apply, Savage said.
- A 2019 study published in the BMJ found that 79% of health apps available through the Google Play store regularly shared user data and were “far from transparent.”
- When it comes to marketing, a pregnant person’s data is particularly of high value and can be hard to hide from the barrage of cookies and bots. Some period-tracking apps, which often ask for health information besides menstrual cycle details, take part in the broader internet data economy, too.
- “The data can be sold to third parties, such as big tech companies; or to insurance companies, where it could then be used to make targeting decisions, such as whether to sell you a life insurance policy, or how much your premium should be,” said Giulia De Togni, a health and artificial intelligence researcher at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.
- Flo Health, headquartered in London, settled with the Federal Trade Commission last year over allegations that the company, after promises of privacy, shared health data of users using its fertility-tracking app with outside data analytics companies, including Facebook and Google.
- In 2019, Ovia Health drew criticism for sharing data — though de-identified and aggregated — with employers, who could purchase the period- and pregnancy-tracking app as a health benefit for their workers. People using the employer-sponsored version must currently opt in for this kind of data-sharing.
- Ovia’s roughly 10,000-word privacy policy details how the company may share or sell de-identified health data and uses tracking technologies for advertisements and analytics on its free, direct-to-consumer version.
- For European residents, companies must comply with the stricter General Data Protection Regulation, which gives ownership of data to the consumer and requires consent before gathering and processing personal data. Consumers also have the right to have their online data erased.
- Companies have the option of extending those rights to people living in the U.S. via their privacy policies and terms of services. If they do so, the FTC can then hold the companies accountable for those commitments, said Deven McGraw, Invitae’s head of data stewardship and the former deputy director for health information privacy at the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights.
- The period-tracking app Cycles, which is owned by Swedish company Perigee, falls into this category. The company promises its users that it does not do any advertising or selling of data to third parties. Instead, it makes money solely through subscriptions, spokesperson Raneal Engineer said.
- Concerned customers have been reaching out to another health app, Clue, developed by a company based in Berlin. “We completely understand this anxiety, and we want to reassure you that your health data, particularly any data you track in Clue about pregnancies, pregnancy loss or abortion, is kept private and safe,” Clue co-CEO Carrie Walter said in an emailed statement.
- Some states, such as California and Virginia, have state-level laws that give users ownership over their information and whether it is sold to third parties.
- Data brokers trade in other types of information, such as location-tracking data for people who visited Planned Parenthood, which potentially could be purchased by law enforcement or government officials. Earlier this month, SafeGraph halted selling cellphone-tracking data mapping the movements of people visiting Planned Parenthood, how long they stayed, and where they went afterward, after Vice reported buying a week’s worth of data for $160.
- Also of concern is a company’s level of data security, and how susceptible it is to a breach. “Hacking is criminal, there’s no question about it,” Savage said. “But once it’s hacked, information can be released.”
- Could This Data Be Used in a Criminal Prosecution?
- The short answer is yes.
- “It’s almost surreal that in some states using a period app could get you into trouble,” said McGraw. “But if an abortion is a crime, it could be accessed in building a case against you.”
- This depends on where you live, but there are no federal protections against that happening from a privacy standpoint, she added. Last year, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which would prohibit data brokers from selling personal information to law enforcement or intelligence agencies without court oversight. But the legislation has yet to make it to a vote.
- Wyden told KHN he was “absolutely” worried about the chance that people who seek an abortion could be incriminated by their phone data.
- “It is really an ominous prospect of women having their personal data weaponized against them,” said Wyden. “These big data outfits,” he said, “gotta decide — are they going to protect the privacy of women who do business with them? Or are they basically going to sell out to the highest bidder?”
- In the absence of a federal law, if law enforcement does get a court-ordered subpoena, it can be difficult for a company to resist handing over data related to a specific case.
- “Given the breadth of surveillance laws in the U.S., if a company collects and keeps information, that information is susceptible to being compelled by law enforcement,” said Amie Stepanovich, a privacy lawyer and vice president of U.S. policy at the Future of Privacy Forum. “They don’t necessarily have the ability to legally keep that information from law enforcement once the proper process has been undertaken.”
- Still, even in states with strict abortion limits on the books, much depends on how those laws are structured. Last month, for instance, a murder charge against a Texas woman for a “self-induced abortion” was dismissed after the district attorney found it did not violate state law, which criminalizes providers performing abortions, not the patients.
- If Roe v. Wade is struck down, 14 states have so-called trigger laws that would automatically go into effect and ban abortion outright or after set windows of time — for instance, six weeks or 15 weeks, according to a KFF analysis.
- “It’s really complicated under the hood, but I don’t think people should blindly assume their data is safe from legal process,” Savage said. It can depend on the company’s approach to subpoenas, she added. Some will fight them while others will not.
- Take Apple, for example, which repeatedly resisted unlocking iPhones for law enforcement in high-profile cases like the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. Data in Apple’s health app, which includes its period tracker, is “encrypted and inaccessible by default,” according to the company’s privacy policy. All the health data in the app is kept on a person’s phone, not stored on servers. But at the same time, Savage said, people who are in low-income communities don’t always have an iPhone because it is an expensive piece of equipment.
- Ovia’s privacy policy says the company may give data to law enforcement if required by law or subpoena. The company, however, said in a statement that it has “never provided Ovia user data to any government, nor have we ever received any government requests for access to Ovia user data.” There is also an option in Ovia’s account settings to delete account data “entirely and permanently.”
- Despite safeguards in place under the GDRP, period trackers based in Europe can still be subpoenaed as well, said Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
- “Even [European Union] companies are subject to the U.S. legal process, though it would take longer,” said Tien. “The U.S. has mutual legal treaties with other countries, including E.U. countries, and law enforcement knows how to exchange information.”
- Has This Kind of Information Been Used by Public Officials or Law Enforcement Before?
- Officials holding anti-abortion views have leveraged period-tracking information in the past. In 2019, former Missouri state health director Dr. Randall Williams obtained a spreadsheet tracking the menstrual periods of women who visited Planned Parenthood in an effort to identify patients who had experienced an abortion that failed to terminate the pregnancy.
- During the Trump administration, former refugee resettlement chief and anti-abortion activist Scott Lloyd admitted to keeping track of the menstrual cycles of teen migrants in an effort to stop them from getting abortions.
- “We are now thinking of period trackers the way we’ve been thinking of facial recognition software for years,” Savage said.
- Should You Delete Your Period-Tracking App?
- Experts said it’s unlikely that a period-tracking app would be the sole piece of evidence used if someone were building a case against you for seeking an abortion.
- “Frankly, I think if law enforcement or a civil investigator were trying to figure out who is having an abortion, there are probably several other venues that are more realistic or more immediately useful,” said Stepanovich. “They would likely get a dump of information for the relevant data,” she continued, “such as trying to get the location information of everyone that got dropped off close to an abortion center, which is a much smaller set of data, or getting people who called abortion hotlines at certain times.”
- Stepanovich added that as long as someone is using a smartphone with any type of app on it there is a risk that data could be obtained and used as part of a criminal or civil prosecution. Bottom line: The only way to avoid risk altogether is to not use a smartphone.
- But McGraw took a more cautious approach: “If I lived in a state where I thought that data might end up in the hands of law enforcement, I wouldn’t track [my period] at all.”
- Ultimately, people who use period-tracking apps should be aware of the risk of using the technology while considering the benefit it brings to their life.
- “You have to think about what you need in terms of period tracking,” said Tien. “You have to weigh and ask yourself, ‘How much does this convenience really matter to me?’”

- Companies have the option of extending those rights to people living in the U.S. via their privacy policies and terms of services. If they do so, the FTC can then hold the companies accountable for those commitments, said Deven McGraw, Invitae’s head of data stewardship and the former deputy director for health information privacy at the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights.
- The period-tracking app Cycles, which is owned by Swedish company Perigee, falls into this category. The company promises its users that it does not do any advertising or selling of data to third parties. Instead, it makes money solely through subscriptions, spokesperson Raneal Engineer said.
- Concerned customers have been reaching out to another health app, Clue, developed by a company based in Berlin. “We completely understand this anxiety, and we want to reassure you that your health data, particularly any data you track in Clue about pregnancies, pregnancy loss or abortion, is kept private and safe,” Clue co-CEO Carrie Walter said in an emailed statement.
- Some states, such as California and Virginia, have state-level laws that give users ownership over their information and whether it is sold to third parties.
- Data brokers trade in other types of information, such as location-tracking data for people who visited Planned Parenthood, which potentially could be purchased by law enforcement or government officials. Earlier this month, SafeGraph halted selling cellphone-tracking data mapping the movements of people visiting Planned Parenthood, how long they stayed, and where they went afterward, after Vice reported buying a week’s worth of data for $160.
- Also of concern is a company’s level of data security, and how susceptible it is to a breach. “Hacking is criminal, there’s no question about it,” Savage said. “But once it’s hacked, information can be released.”
- Could This Data Be Used in a Criminal Prosecution?
- The short answer is yes.
- “It’s almost surreal that in some states using a period app could get you into trouble,” said McGraw. “But if an abortion is a crime, it could be accessed in building a case against you.”
- This depends on where you live, but there are no federal protections against that happening from a privacy standpoint, she added. Last year, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) introduced the Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act, which would prohibit data brokers from selling personal information to law enforcement or intelligence agencies without court oversight. But the legislation has yet to make it to a vote.
- Wyden told KHN he was “absolutely” worried about the chance that people who seek an abortion could be incriminated by their phone data.
- “It is really an ominous prospect of women having their personal data weaponized against them,” said Wyden. “These big data outfits,” he said, “gotta decide — are they going to protect the privacy of women who do business with them? Or are they basically going to sell out to the highest bidder?”
- In the absence of a federal law, if law enforcement does get a court-ordered subpoena, it can be difficult for a company to resist handing over data related to a specific case.
- “Given the breadth of surveillance laws in the U.S., if a company collects and keeps information, that information is susceptible to being compelled by law enforcement,” said Amie Stepanovich, a privacy lawyer and vice president of U.S. policy at the Future of Privacy Forum. “They don’t necessarily have the ability to legally keep that information from law enforcement once the proper process has been undertaken.”
- Still, even in states with strict abortion limits on the books, much depends on how those laws are structured. Last month, for instance, a murder charge against a Texas woman for a “self-induced abortion” was dismissed after the district attorney found it did not violate state law, which criminalizes providers performing abortions, not the patients.
- If Roe v. Wade is struck down, 14 states have so-called trigger laws that would automatically go into effect and ban abortion outright or after set windows of time — for instance, six weeks or 15 weeks, according to a KFF analysis.
- “It’s really complicated under the hood, but I don’t think people should blindly assume their data is safe from legal process,” Savage said. It can depend on the company’s approach to subpoenas, she added. Some will fight them while others will not.
- Take Apple, for example, which repeatedly resisted unlocking iPhones for law enforcement in high-profile cases like the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. Data in Apple’s health app, which includes its period tracker, is “encrypted and inaccessible by default,” according to the company’s privacy policy. All the health data in the app is kept on a person’s phone, not stored on servers. But at the same time, Savage said, people who are in low-income communities don’t always have an iPhone because it is an expensive piece of equipment.
- Ovia’s privacy policy says the company may give data to law enforcement if required by law or subpoena. The company, however, said in a statement that it has “never provided Ovia user data to any government, nor have we ever received any government requests for access to Ovia user data.” There is also an option in Ovia’s account settings to delete account data “entirely and permanently.”
- Despite safeguards in place under the GDRP, period trackers based in Europe can still be subpoenaed as well, said Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
- “Even [European Union] companies are subject to the U.S. legal process, though it would take longer,” said Tien. “The U.S. has mutual legal treaties with other countries, including E.U. countries, and law enforcement knows how to exchange information.”
- Has This Kind of Information Been Used by Public Officials or Law Enforcement Before?
- Officials holding anti-abortion views have leveraged period-tracking information in the past. In 2019, former Missouri state health director Dr. Randall Williams obtained a spreadsheet tracking the menstrual periods of women who visited Planned Parenthood in an effort to identify patients who had experienced an abortion that failed to terminate the pregnancy.
- During the Trump administration, former refugee resettlement chief and anti-abortion activist Scott Lloyd admitted to keeping track of the menstrual cycles of teen migrants in an effort to stop them from getting abortions.
- “We are now thinking of period trackers the way we’ve been thinking of facial recognition software for years,” Savage said.
- Should You Delete Your Period-Tracking App?
- Experts said it’s unlikely that a period-tracking app would be the sole piece of evidence used if someone were building a case against you for seeking an abortion.
- “Frankly, I think if law enforcement or a civil investigator were trying to figure out who is having an abortion, there are probably several other venues that are more realistic or more immediately useful,” said Stepanovich. “They would likely get a dump of information for the relevant data,” she continued, “such as trying to get the location information of everyone that got dropped off close to an abortion center, which is a much smaller set of data, or getting people who called abortion hotlines at certain times.”
- Stepanovich added that as long as someone is using a smartphone with any type of app on it there is a risk that data could be obtained and used as part of a criminal or civil prosecution. Bottom line: The only way to avoid risk altogether is to not use a smartphone.
- But McGraw took a more cautious approach: “If I lived in a state where I thought that data might end up in the hands of law enforcement, I wouldn’t track [my period] at all.”
- Ultimately, people who use period-tracking apps should be aware of the risk of using the technology while considering the benefit it brings to their life.
- “You have to think about what you need in terms of period tracking,” said Tien. “You have to weigh and ask yourself, ‘How much does this convenience really matter to me?’”

- The new Apple Watch might come with women's health features, but is it the right time?
- If credible rumors about the Apple Watch Series 8 are to be believed, Apple may soon (Sept. 7 to be exact) control intimate access to information about its users' wombs. But that information demands more secrecy than ever, and Apple's announcement could raise alarms if it doesn't handle this issue with unprecedented amounts of delicacy and sensitivity.
- Rumors from the Wall Street Journal(opens in a new tab), and Apple experts Mark Gurman(opens in a new tab), and Ming-Chi Kuo(opens in a new tab) say the new watch might include "women's health" features like fertility planning. It would be a natural progression from menstrual cycle tracking which was first introduced with WatchOS 6. But unlike cycle tracking which uses machine learning from your menstrual history, the fertility feature would use a sensor that measures the fluctuations in body temperature which correlate with a person's ovulation cycle. It's an exciting advancement that would join Apple Watch features that measure blood oxygen level, ECG, heart rate and sleep patterns.
- But following the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the issue of what big tech companies do with women's health data has never been more consequential. This summer, Facebook turned over private messages(opens in a new tab) between a teenage girl and her mother to the authorities as evidence of breaking Nebraska abortion laws. Meta issued a statement(opens in a new tab) saying there was no mention of abortion in the search warrant and that they were complying with an investigation of "alleged illegal burning and burial of a stillborn infant." But since we already know tech companies provide information to law enforcement(opens in a new tab) that can put people behind bars, a world in which data-tracking of this sort leads directly to arrests and convictions for abortions is easy to imagine.
- "The biggest challenge in the reproductive rights space right now is the fact the data that's being gathered about you is not in your possession," said Dr. Jennifer King, a Privacy and Data Policy fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.
- The data that you no longer own is vulnerable to hacking and data breaches. It can also be sold to third parties, with or without your knowledge. Last year, period tracking app Flo reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission for misleading users about where its data was being shared. Specifically, it told Facebook every time a user had their period or indicated that they wanted to get pregnant (per the Wall Street Journal(opens in a new tab).)
- Modern gadgets tend not to store information of this nature locally on the device, and leave it at that. In cases like Amazon's Alexa, or with Google search queries, data goes into a server or the cloud and is stored rather than deleted. If Apple is going against the grain, and designing this hypothetical feature with local, encrypted data storage, rather than cloud storage  "that's a huge improvement right there," said King.
- And in fairness, Apple says the health features on the current Apple Watch protect user data in several ways: All health and fitness data is encrypted — apart from Medical ID which provides medical information to first responders without the need for a passcode. If you back up your health data in iCloud, it is end-to-end encrypted (Apple doesn't specify(opens in a new tab) where it's stored if not backed up in iCloud.) If you use two-factor authentication, that data is also end-to-end encrypted. All of these features are accessed through the Health app, which also lives on your iPhone. But you can choose to sync your devices, which is inherently riskier.
- In general, Apple's features and devices indicate a strong focus on user privacy. When you use Apple's voice assistant Siri, the audio is processed on your iPhone, unlike Alexa whose data is sent back to Amazon's servers. Apple's soon-to-debut iOS 16 comes with a feature called Safety Check which will allow users in domestic violence situations to quickly revoke access to their devices and data.
- Yet, even with stringent built-in privacy, there's still the issue of law enforcement being able to access your device. If they were trying to use this data as a way to understand your reproductive cycle, King said, "then we get into that fight around 'can they make me unlock my watch?' 'Can they make me unlock my phone?' 'Is there a way for me to just delete that data quickly with no trace?'"
- When Roe v. Wade was overturned, a flurry of concern surrounded period tracking apps and how user data might be used to bring about criminal charges in states where abortion was banned or restricted. "Unfortunately, the lack of consumer privacy protections mean that risks extend far beyond the use of Apple watch functions or third-party apps," said Dr. Nicol Turner Lee, a senior fellow in Governance Studies and director of the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings. "People could be incriminated in states where abortion becomes illegal for content in their search history, text messaging and more."
- And so, period tracking apps have scrambled to assure users that their data is safe. Flo launched "Anonymous Mode(opens in a new tab)" which removes any identifiable user information, Glow asserted(opens in a new tab) that it has never and will never sell user data (although there's no specific mention of working with law enforcement), and Stardust announced that it was the "first recognized app to offer end-to-end encryption for all users."
- Currently, no period tracking app has been asked to hand over its user data in a criminal investigation, meaning there's no legal precedent. But following from the recent example of Facebook being kept in the dark (supposedly) about the abortion-related nature of the evidence it turned over, there are loopholes.
- "On a comparative level, Apple has already been doing a lot better than other third-party applications," said Turner Lee, who is also Editor in Chief of TechTank. "Their health data is 'encrypted and inaccessible by default,' and the company has had a past history of respecting user privacy and not unlocking iPhones for law enforcement purposes."
- So while the risk is still there, Apple has a better track record of protecting its users.
- Despite a climate of uncertainty over digital privacy and reproductive rights, tech companies are plowing ahead with technology that gathers biometric data. Amazon recently expanded its pilot to test palm-recognition payment technology in Whole Foods stores and Facebook wants to track your biometric data in the Metaverse, per the Financial Times(opens in a new tab).
- Why? "Because you can," said King. "It's a sensor in search of a solution, if you want to put it that way." And that solution generates lucrative data for companies and keeps users bound to those companies' products. But in a climate where something that was a right yesterday is a crime today, it may be time to rethink where we leave our digital mark.
