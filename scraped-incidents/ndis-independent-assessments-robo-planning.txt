- The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is Australia's system for publicly supporting people with disabilities. Legally created in 2013, it was launched in 2020 under the auspices of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA).
- In 2021, the Australian government proposed introducing independent assessments for NDIS participants over the age of 7. Assessors had to be qualified independent health professionals making assessments of 1 to 4 hours using standardised assessment tools that would feed into an algorithm that decides a 'personalised budget' for each applicant.
- The Australian government had argued the scheme would reduce inequality and improve the consistency of decision-making. But it quickly ran into technical and political headwinds, with disability groups saying they had not been properly consulted.
- Bruce Bonyhady, the inaugural chairman of the NDIA and an original architect of the scheme, slammed (pdf) the policy as 'robo-planning' built on insufficient evidence the new tools adequately assess disability and which 'puts people in boxes before they have had a chance to outline what they would like to achieve or the ways in which they hope their lives change.'
- Furthermore, the Australian government claimed publicly the scheme was not a cost-cutting measure, but leaked documents revealed it would deliver AUD 700 million reduction in funds allocated for disability support.
- In July 2021, NDIS Minister Linda Reynolds said the federal government would not push ahead with the proposal.

- One of the key architects of the National Disability Insurance Scheme has called for the immediate halt of independent assessments to determine whether people with disabilities are eligible for funding and the amount they receive.
- The NDIS is trialling the use of independent assessments where a government-contracted allied health professional assesses eligibility and the amount of funding based on a consultation, which on average takes just three hours, instead of reports from the applicant’s own medical specialists.

- Professor Bruce Bonyhady told a parliamentary inquiry he totally opposed the independent assessments, which he said were driven by cost cutting and would “fundamentally damage the NDIS”.
- He said the assessments were not independent and should be called “robo-planning” because, like robo-debt, they applied a mathematical formula in ways it should never be used.
- “Robo-planning could be used to exclude participants, cap plans or change the NDIS eligibility criteria,” said Professor Bonyhady, who was the inaugural chair of the National Disability Insurance Agency from 2013 to 2016.
- “These planned reforms completely undermine the vision of the NDIS and as a result they’ve caused tremendous fear, anxiety and anger amongst people with disability, their families and carers. Trust between the National Disability Insurance Agency and the disability community has reached new lows, which is extraordinary.”
- An NDIA spokesperson said the current approach relied on individuals seeking their own assessments at their own expense, resulting in those who had the capacity to pay for and gather assessments receiving more funds in their plans on average.
- “Independent assessments are one element of a program of improvements that will create a fairer, simpler and more flexible NDIS,” the spokesperson said.
- “They will ensure eligible participants can access and use the scheme, and to build more flexible plans, where participants can have more choice over how they use their NDIS budget.”
- The NDIA spokesperson said there were no proposed caps for individual plans and eligibility criteria would not change under independent assessments.
- “There is no directive for independent assessments to reduce individual participant plans. At each plan review, a participant’s plan may go up or down depending on their needs.”
- However, participants and disability groups fear the assessments won’t give a true picture of people’s needs, will be conducted by professionals with no expertise in their disability and are a stealthy way of cutting costs.
- The NDIS had planned to begin mandatory assessments by the middle of the year but the new NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, this month flagged the rollout would be put on hold. She said she would be closely assessing the independent trial outcomes before introducing legislation.
- But Professor Bonyhady, who is now the director of the Melbourne Disability Institute at Melbourne University, said the assessments should be abandoned immediately before they caused further needless distress.
- He told Federal Parliament’s joint standing committee on the NDIS on Friday the assessments used standardised tools for purposes for which they were never designed and there was not a “shred of evidence” of their validity.
- “The claim that the tools are ‘globally recognised assessment tools to ensure consistency and fairness’ is false,” he said.
- “I believe we’re going down this path because the government and the agency are concerned about the scheme’s sustainability. So the real driver of all of this is cost cutting.”
- Professor Bonyhady said the fact that independent assessments had reached the current stage of implementation was “a disgrace”. “It should have been stopped long before now ... The NDIA and the government need to go back to the drawing board.”
- Allied health professionals from six professions will conduct the independent assessments under the current proposal.
- However the national peak association for Australia’s allied health professions told the inquiry the sector was not consulted before the trial.
- “All the pilots are occurring without consultation with the allied health sector, whose professionals are actually undertaking the assessments,” said Allied Health Professionals Australia chief executive officer Claire Hewat.
- “Important questions about the assessor workforce and the processes for ensuring the quality of assessments remain unanswered.”
- Ms Hewat said she welcomed Senator Reynolds’ decision to pause the rollout of the independent assessments.
- “We hope that will mean there will be a genuine look at how this is being done and this is not just being done to quell unrest,” she said. “We call on the government to recognise that it is seeking to put in place a process that is largely new and untested.”
- Occupational Therapy Australia board member Leanne Healey said the independent assessment pilot was “unscientific, it’s unethical and it has the potential to do real harm”.
- She described the independent assessments as “little more than an exercise in data entry”.
- “It is a suite of tools that’s unsuited to the task of determining eligibility,” Ms Healey said.
- “The tool kit lacks sensitivity, specificity, and in many cases relevance to a broad range of people who live with a substantial and permanent disability.”
- Ms Healey said the pilot should be scrapped before it did further harm.
- One of the members of the joint committee, Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John, said the inquiry had heard “incredibly compelling evidence” that the independent assessments were already causing disabled people harm.
- “Based on this evidence, the trials must be immediately halted,” he said.

- NDIS architect Bruce Bonyhady urges rethink of independent assessments
- An architect of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) wants the federal government to scrap its overhaul of eligibility testing for the program, saying the changes have spread fear and stress among Australians with disabilities.
- Former National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) chairman Bruce Bonyhady says the government needs to "go back to the drawing board", describing as "robo-planning" the new independent assessment model being introduced this year.
- "Unfortunately, it is clear that the announcement of the introduction of [independent assessments] has created enormous fear, stress and concern amongst NDIS participants, their families and carers," Professor Bonyhady writes in a submission to the agency as part of a consultation on the changes.
- "It is therefore disturbing that the NDIA intends to replace the current planning process with an almost total reliance on independent assessments."
- Professor Bonyhady's intervention adds an authoritative voice to criticism of the changes, which has so far been led by disability groups who say the new model threatens to undermine the original purpose of the scheme.
- Until this year, applicants for the NDIS have relied on evidence from their treating doctors and expert medical reports to prove their eligibility and help determine their funding.
- Under the new model, applicants will be examined by private contractors using questionnaires and other tools designed to assess capacity.
- Existing NDIS participants will be required to undergo an assessment whenever they need to update their support plan.
- But Professor Bonyhady says there is not enough evidence that the new tools adequately assess disability and help the agency to decide on an applicant's support needs.
- "It begins with a participant's impairments, rather than their goals and aspirations," he writes.
- "It puts people in boxes before they have had a chance to outline what they would like to achieve or the ways in which they hope their lives change."
- He also says the assessment sessions — which have to run for at least 20 minutes, but typically last 2.5 to three hours — are not long enough to determine an applicant's disability.
- "It seems unlikely that assessors will be given the necessary time to carefully and accurately use the tools and so complete an accurate assessment," he writes.
- "Without sufficient time, the capacity to develop valid individualised plans will be undermined."
- The NDIA and the Minister for the NDIS, Stuart Robert, have declined to be interviewed about the new model and Professor Bonyhady's criticism.
- In a statement, Mr Robert said the changes would align the scheme's assessment processes with the original design of the NDIS by the Productivity Commission in 2011.
- "The government acknowledges there is an inordinate amount of fear and stress amongst NDIS participants, largely due to the spread of misinformation about the reforms," the statement said.
- "The government completely rejects any notion there has been no consultation on reforms to the NDIS."
- Read the full statement from a spokesman for NDIS Minister Stuart Robert
- Mr Bonyhady's submission says the changes "could have the unintended consequence of potentially undermining the sustainability of the scheme".
- "It will inevitably lead to participants and their advocates identifying every impairment in order to increase the likelihood of a sufficient resource allocation," he writes.
- "It is also likely to generate inequity, as those who are better educated or more knowledgeable about the underlying assumptions of the questions will be more successful in detailing their impairments in a particular way."
- He uses the example of a question commonly used in functional assessment, "Can you dress yourself?", which he says cannot always be answered with a "yes" or "no".
- "Without further information and context, simplistic responses risk misleading or inaccurate scores," he writes.
- "This jeopardises the validity of the entire assessment — and the resource allocation which will follow it."

- Last week, more than 20 disability organisations called on the federal government to abandon the new model, saying they had not been properly consulted.
- Professor Bonyhady was the inaugural chairman of the NDIS from 2013 to 2016 and led the advisory panel that advised the Productivity Commission's work to design the scheme in 2010-2011.
- He writes in his submission that he also coined the name National Disability Insurance Scheme during the Rudd government's 2020 summit in 2008.
- Professor Bonyhady now heads the Melbourne Disability Institute at the University of Melbourne.
- "For a decade and a half, meeting individualised needs, ensuring fairness and justice for people with disability, especially those facing multiple disadvantages, have been the driving forces behind my commitment to what is now the NDIS," he writes.
- "Regrettably, independent assessment is totally inconsistent with this vision."

National Affairs Editor
- The government’s planned NDIS independent assessments are akin to “robo-planning” and will “blow up” the crucial scheme, one of its key architects says.
- Melbourne Disability Institute director Professor Bruce Bonyhady, who was instrumental in designing the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), has raised concerns that the government is removing the individualised nature of the NDIS and replacing it with an algorithm which will see many individuals receiving less support.
- He compared this to the government’s robodebt scheme, which the Coalition has since admitted was “legally insufficient” and led to a $1.2 billion class-action lawsuit settlement.
- 
- The federal government is planning to introduce “independent assessments” to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which would see assessors deciding on individuals’ needs and how much funding they will receive, rather than specialist reports.
- New Government Services Minister Linda Reynolds has “paused” the rollout of the independent assessments, but there is no indication they have been scrapped.
- Professor Bonyhady labeled these independent assessments as “robo-planning” using an algorithm in a way it was not meant to, similarly to robodebt.
- “Independent assessments are not independent. Robo-planning will blow up the NDIS. And it will also blow up the vision for this scheme to be there for all Australians,” Professor Bonyhady told the inquiry.
- “With no transparency, robo-planning could be used to exclude participants, cut plans, or change the NDIS eligibility criteria. And the NDIA would not be able to be held to account for such actions. The fact that robo-planning has reached the current stage of implementation is a disgrace. It should have been stopped long before now.”
- These calls were backed by former NDIS Technology Authority chief Marie Johnson, who said “robo-planning” will “create enormous problems”.
- “The [independent assessments] go to the agency, which looks at these checkboxes and then robo-generate a plan. A lot of peoples’ circumstances aren’t being taken into account,” Ms Johnson told InnovationAus.
- “What this will mean is that people won’t get the opportunity to provide additional information. The original assessment can’t be reviewed, people will get a plan or a budget that does not meet their needs and people will fear for their health and wellbeing.”
- Both Professor Bonyhady and Ms Johnson compared the new NDIS program to the failed robodebt scheme, which matched data held by the ATO and Centrelink to issue automated debt notices to welfare recipients. This system was found to regularly generate false or non-existent debts, and shifted the onus to prove they were incorrect onto the welfare recipient.
- Both systems will use algorithms to perform crucial government functions with less human oversight, and put the onus to prove debts don’t exist or more funding should be received onto the individual, they said.
- It’s not the only similarity between the planned NDIS changes and the botched robodebt scheme. The Saturday Paper recently reported that two key public servants who worked on establishing the robodebt compliance program have since moved to work at the NDIS compliance division, with one making “substantial” comments on the draft legislation.
- There is no transparency around the formula that will be used to calculate these NDIS plans, Ms Johson said.
- “What they’re saying is ‘we have to make it fair’, but one of the problems with algorithms is the bias that’s built into algorithms. What we’re going to be seeing here is a bureaucratic notion of fairness constructing the algorithm without any visibility or transparency, or co-design about what the algorithm actually says,” she says.
- “Whose notion of fairness are they actually talking about? This is going to create enormous problems.”
- In a submission to the committee, Mr Bonyhady said the planned changes are “fundamentally flawed”.
- “If introduced as currently planned, they will undermine and potentially destroy the vision of the NDIS and reduce it to little more than ‘robo-planning’. The NDIA should go back to the drawing board and use the data it is collecting to ensure the scheme remains focused on the people it is intended to serve and becomes the world leading reform it is intended to be,” Mr Bonyhady said.
- “Unless the NDIA changes course, there is a very real danger that independent assessments will have all the hallmarks of automated ‘robo-planning’, rather than the individualised planning and funding process that people with disabilities and their families fought so hard for when campaigning for the NDIS.”
- Ms Johson has previously raised concerns with the “defective” tech systems underpinning the NDIS, and she said the rollout of independent assessments will further compound these issues.
- “The systems are so defective that documents participants provide are regularly lost. These are the systems that will be relied upon for these independent assessments,” Ms Johnson said.
- “What effectively you have is a new doctrine, which is yet to be made law, that says we’ll put you through a process which is not appealable, and from that process a robo-plan will be generated.
- “The doctrine of fairness which will drive the algorithms that are going to be generating these plans, and these algorithms are not subject to any ethics – that’s the key issue.”
- The Guardian reported last week that the introduction of “robo-planning” has been estimated to potentially save the federal government $700 million over four years, contradicting claims from Ministers that it is not a cost-cutting measure.
- The NDIA is currently running a second pilot of the independent assessments. The federal government has now said it will wait to evaluate this pilot and consult with stakeholders before going ahead more widely with the assessments, after initially planning to make them mandatory from the mid-year.
- There are concerns about the NDIA “luring” participants into taking part in the trial by using tactics similar to those employed in phishing scams. The “scam-like” messages sent to NDIS participants, some with intellectual disabilities, included offers of $150 in exchange for participation, and wording like “exclusive invitation”.
- The government is also readying to launch an NDIS app within months, providing a smartphone-based version of what is currently available to participants on the web browser. Ms Johnson has previously said she is concerned about the “dangerous future” in the government’s tech experimentations around the NDIS, including a trial of the use of blockchain technology in recent years.

- After more than twenty years of ‘citizen centric’ strategies by governments around the world, this week saw the demolition in Australia of any pretence of citizen-centric, participant-centric, person-centric – or any other version strategy based on ‘human’ centricity.
- The theatre of citizen-centric has now run its course. And in the year 2021, citizen-centric has been replaced by the ungoverned rise of machine-centric algorithms.
- Last week under questioning at the Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS Inquiry into Independent Assessments, the NDIA revealed for the first time the architecture of the algorithms to be used in robo-planning.
- Also in evidence, commentators including myself have raised serious concerns on the application of algorithms, and the additive impact of algorithms, on people with a disability.
- Lacking any transparency or ethics, the broad-brush description of the algorithm architecture involves the construction by the agency of 400 personas based on disability, age and other factors.
- Would indigeneity, language, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) people and homelessness be factors? We don’t know. The determinants of the algorithm personas have not been subject to any independent external scrutiny.
- The agency indicated that a technical paper would be released, and it is understood that the sector and academic and legal community will forensically examine it.
- But given the timeframes promulgated by the government, any feedback is likely to be too late. The assumptions and determinants will have already been baked into the algorithm – or algorithms, as there will be more than one.
- Algorithms that include debt recovery. And algorithms that include the extensive and yet to be legislated changes that the community only found out about because the draft legislation had been leaked.
- And a cautionary word about ‘personas’.
- Personas are typically the collaborative outcome of a co-design process, used to tell a story from the person’s perspective of their experience, with all the uncomfortable, confronting, and messy details of life. More controversially, they are often used in HCI design although with issues of stereotyping a major concern.
- But the apparent use of personas in the construction of the NDIS robo-planning algorithms, is a perverted application of this method.
- With the lack of transparency and ethics – and the absence of co-design – the algorithms become a construction of internal modelling where bias is inescapable.
- Not only will bias be baked in, but the operation of these powerful algorithms is not subject to independent scrutiny or appeal.
- And all this has arisen because the agency has created a seething mess of administrative and conceptual complexity that it cannot manage.
- Sliding doors of complexity so unfathomable that the scheme itself has become manifestly unjust.
- So their answer is to put over 530,000 Australians with disability into 400 persona boxes and wipe out any pretence of the notion “participant centric”.
- We could see this coming over recent years when the word “co-design” disappeared from key corporate documents. I was criticised for pointing this out.
- In reality, it matters not whether the number is 400 or 4,000 personas, as this approach treats Australians with disability as an amorphous data mass and not as individuals with rights, and with unique lives and needs.
- And it is a harbinger of things to come for those on welfare, aged care and veterans.
- Certainly data analytics is critical. And better and transparent data analytics is urgently needed.
- But the political arguments around scheme sustainability not only ignore the benefits side of the equation, but completely ignore complexity as a most significant factor impacting sustainability.
- The original 2011 Productivity Commission Report referred to complexity as “confusopoly”.
- And an overwhelming number of the more than 260 submissions to the Inquiry on Independent Assessments describe the injustice and human rights impact of complexity on all communities, especially First Nations people, CALD communities, and people with psychosocial disability.
- The Victorian Council of Social Service (VCOSS) Submission (number 153) for example describes the barriers of complexity, literacy and “magic words”.
- The complexity sees documents and highly personal information, lost. This is the experience of a great many people evidenced in submissions to this Senate Inquiry and other inquiries including the Tune Review.
- A recent poll on the NDIS Grassroots Facebook group (with 55,000 members), indicated as many as 80 per cent of people experience lost documents. This would be an enormous cost driver across the whole system.
- Imagine if 80 per cent of people undergoing an Independent Assessment, had their documents lost. There is no guarantee that this will not happen.
- So an end-to-end co-designed time-and-motion study would be immensely revealing. And this should be done before any structural changes to the scheme are made.
- Automation and the application of algorithms, which will be inherently biased, do not overcome complexity nor the injustice, disadvantage and cost this causes.
- To the contrary, there is international evidence that algorithms deployed by the state cause harm and compound injustice.
- So, all up, it is not clear what ‘problem’ the personas are intended to address.
- Except the effect of this is to digitally institutionalise people with disability into boxes, and to subject them to lifelong examination, study and control.
- In response to the proposed changes that have been unanimously slammed by every sector of the community, Minister Reynolds challenged: “if somebody could come up with a better option…”
- As if that challenge had not been well anticipated, in the more than 260 submissions to the Senate Inquiry into Independent Assessments.
- People with disability, experts, health professionals, NGOs, service providers, state and territory governments, advocates: thousands of hours of documented evidence and insightful thoughtful solutions and recommendations.
- Like many people, my family found the process of writing a submission detailing our harrowing experience, very painful.
- But we, and hundreds of thousands of Australians have a vested interest in the sustainability of the NDIS.
- And in stirring testimony at the Senate hearing, Mr Dougie Herd Chair of the ACT Disability Reference Group and one of the original campaigners for the NDIS, challenged back “…this is super personal.”
- It is personal and yet we have been reduced to personas, components in algorithms.
- The upending of the NDIS social contract has precipitated an insidious episode of servicing by algorithm, in which no Australian has had a say.
- Until the government publishes the design of the algorithms and intended applications, their use must stop immediately.

- Former NDIS chairman slams changes to support scheme as 'robo-planning' and 'a disgrace'
- Former chairman of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Bruce Bonyhady has labelled changes to the support scheme a "disgrace" that should be abandoned immediately before they cause more needless distress.
- Mr Bonyhady made the remarks at a parliamentary inquiry into major reforms of the NDIS on Friday, calling proposed independent assessments "robo-planning" that would "fundamentally damage" the scheme.
- He was the first witness at a one-day hearing in Melbourne being conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS.
- "It is not just current participants and their families who should be anxious and angry about what the government and the NDIA have planned," Mr Bonyhady told the inquiry.
- "All Australians should be gravely concerned about robo-planning because it will tear up the social contract at the heart of the NDIS."
- The introduction of independent assessments was announced in August last year and would see changes to the way people are assessed as eligible for the scheme and determine their funding.
- It would involve a three-hour meeting with an allied health professional, unknown to the applicant, whose role it is to establish that person's capabilities and requirements.
- A second pilot of independent assessments began in October and currently has more than 6,000 participants taking part.
- Mr Bonyhady said people with disability needed to have "pride and confidence" in the scheme but that the "relationship" had reached "new lows".
- "The NDIS and the government need to go back to the drawing board.
- "These planned reforms completely undermine the vision of the NDIS and as a result, they've caused tremendous anxiety and anger amongst people with disability, their families and carers."
- People with lived experience also gave evidence to the committee that they were "terrified" of independent assessments.
- Kristin O'Connell, who has autism, broke down as she told the inquiry about her fears of being re-traumatised after fighting to get a diagnosis and prove her disability.
- "Nothing about independent assessments is positive for a person like me," she said.
- "It's not fair to treat us as a burden."
- Ms O'Connell said it felt like independent assessments would discriminate against people like herself with "invisible" disabilities.
- In a statement, new Minister for the NDIS Linda Reynolds said she "strongly disagreed" with Mr Bonyhady's "characterisation of independent assessments" as "robo-planning."
- "NDIS access and planning decisions are made by people and any other suggestion is inaccurate," she said.
- Ms Reynolds said she welcomed the committee's inquiry and looked forward to reading their findings.
- "I won't be finalising the implementation of independent assessments until after the trial is complete and I have met again with state and territory ministers in July."
- Last week, Ms Reynolds announced she was pausing the introduction of the assessments.
- She said she was "passionate" about the scheme and wanted it to endure for "many generations to come".
- The government has always maintained that independent assessments were an original part of the scheme and would ensure the system was fair and equitable for everyone with disability.
- The Joint Standing Committee inquiry will hold further hearings into the issue in Hobart, Perth and Canberra over the next month.

- One of the chief architects of the NDIS has condemned plans to introduce mandatory independent assessments for participants, warning it would "blow up the vision for the scheme".
- In blistering evidence to a parliamentary inquiry examining the controversial proposal, Bruce Bonyhady said it was a disgrace that what he described as "robo-planning" hadn't already been abandoned.
- Prof Bonyhady said the Morrison government was pursuing the changes to cut costs, an aim he said was born from an misunderstanding of what factors were putting the $22 billion scheme under financial pressure.
- He also despaired at the fractured relationship between the disability community and the agency in charge of the scheme, saying distrust had plunged to a "new low".
- Prof Bonyhady was the NDIS's inaugural chairman and led the panel which advised the Productivity Commission's work to design the scheme a decade ago.
- Now the director of the Melbourne Disability Institute, Prof Bonyhady appeared before the inquiry on Friday morning to argue against changes he feared would undermine the purpose of the scheme.
- The government's plan to use their own panel of contractors to conduct assessments on NDIS participants has faced fierce and sustained opposition from disability groups, Labor and the Greens.
- New NDIS Linda Reynolds has bowed to pressure and paused the permanent rollout of independent assessments pending further consultation, but has made clear the government is committed to a system it believes will be fairer.
- Prof Bonyhady cited a number of reasons as the basis for him being "totally opposed" to the new system.
- He was highly critical of plans to use the same "toolkit" of standardised tests for assessments on participants, regardless of their disability.
- He also raised alarm about the prospect that participants would have no avenue to appeal or challenge their assessors' findings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The agency could use that power to cut participants' budgets or exclude people from the scheme, he feared.
- "It is not just current participants and their families who should be anxious and angry about what the government and the NDIA have planned," he said.
- "All Australians should be gravely concerned about robo-planning because it will tear up the social contract at the heart of the NDIS.
- "This contract says that if you, or your child or grandchild is born with or acquires a significant or permanent disability then they will be eligible for tailored supports based on their individual goals and needs.
- "This contract will disappear if robo-planning is introduced."
- READ MORE:
- Asked if the proposed changes could mark a turning point for the scheme, Prof Bonyhady went further.
- "Robo-planning will blow up the NDIS," he said.
- "It will also blow up the vision for this scheme to be there for all Australians."
- Prof Bonyhady said he used the term "robo-planning" because of similarities to the controversial robo-debt program.
- "Independent assessments are not independent, they are robo-planning and that is the term which I will use," he said.
- "Every time you refer to the changes as independent assessments you are reinforcing a deliberate misrepresentation."

- The federal government is in a “mad rush” to turn the NDIS into a “human-free robo-system” and should move to immediately scrap plans to introduce mandatory independent assessments, shadow government services minister Bill Shorten says.
- The federal government is planning to introduce mandatory “independent assessments” for people already accessing or looking to access the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Independent assessments would see government-appointed assessors deciding on an individuals’ needs and how much funding they will receive, rather than their existing specialists.
- New Government Services Minister Linda Reynolds has “paused” the rollout of these assessments while a second trial is being conducted, but there is no indication they will be scrapped. A government website on the NDIS said these assessments will become mandatory in “late 2021”.
- They have been slammed by advocates as a cost-cutting measure that will harm Australians with disabilities, and as a move to automate the NDIS.
- Bruce Bonyhady, a key architect of the NDIS, recently said these changes are akin to “robo-planning” and will “blow up” the scheme if they are implemented.
- At a National Press Club address on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Shorten backed these calls and said the government should immediately abandon plans to introduce the independent assessments, and tear up contracts it has signed with providers to conduct them.
- “The promise of the NDIS is being betrayed. Not yet fatally, but certainly substantially. The NDIS has been chaperoned by the cavalier vandalism of successive Liberal governments. After eight years of neglect, and seven different ministers for disability, I’m sorry to say that the ongoing existence of the scheme, as it was dreamed to be, is at risk,” Mr Shorten said.
- “It is not overstating things to say that those in charge at a ministerial and agency level have been more concerned with data points than people, that they are too secretive, that there is too much of a closed shop, a black box dealing with the key numbers as evidence and this approach is killing trust.
- “It is not too much to say that they are in a mad rush to trade a vital public service for a human-free robo-system.”
- The move to implement independent assessments is “privatisation by stealth”, Mr Shorten said.
- “The so-called independent assessments are not independent at all. They are robo-planning from the government who brought us robodebt and, as with robodebt, robo-planning is based on flawed mathematical algorithms,” he said.
- “It has been constructed in a black box and the disability community fear it and detest it legitimately. Those currently in charge of the scheme see people with disability as numbers on a page, data in a system, a cost to be reduced.”
- On Tuesday, a number of disability advocates and people with a disability appeared before a public hearing as part of a senate inquiry into the independent assessments plans.
- People With Disabilities president Samantha Connor told the Senators the “robo-planning” is a “travesty” that should be “ceased immediately”. Ms Connor also urged the committee to further investigate the trial of incorporating blockchain payments into the NDIS, attempts to link data and how privacy is being “disregarded” in this process.
- People With Disabilities WA executive director Brendan Cullinan also appeared at the hearing, saying he has “deep concerns” about the independent assessments plan, which he said would “further exacerbate the entrenched disadvantage experienced” by many people with disabilities.
- The independent assessments introduce the “problematic nature of automated decision-making”, Mr Cullinan said in a submission to the inquiry. He said that the independent assessments framework points to some level of automation taking place in deciding how much funding an individual will receive.
- “We can only presume that an algorithm/logic has been developed to determine how the results of an independent assessment translate into a particular budget amount,” Mr Cullinan said.
- “Without clear, transparent information on how the independent assessment is being translated to a plan budget there is no assurance that this process is not based, at least in part, on automated decision-making.
- “Essentially both the information a decision is based on and the process for making that decision are unable to be scrutinised. The lack of effective remedy in these circumstances make it all the more concerning.”

- Exclusive: Secret government documents contradict Coalition’s claim that controversial policy is ‘not a cost-cutting measure’
- The introduction of independent assessments to the National Disability Insurance Scheme would save the federal budget $700m and lead to smaller funding packages “on average”, according to secret government documents that contradict Coalition claims the policy is “not a cost-cutting measure”.
- Under proposed changes to the eligibility assessments process, participants would undergo a three-hour interview with a government-contracted allied health professional instead of submitting reports from their own treating specialists.
- Asked in March whether the policy was aimed at finding efficiencies within the $22bn scheme, the former minister, Stuart Robert, insisted: “This is not a cost-cutting measure … at all.”
- But confidential documents seen by Guardian Australia reveal the National Disability Insurance Agency last year estimated using “independent functional assessments” for planning and access decisions would “reduce the forward estimates by $0.7 billion”. That’s $700m over four years.
- The documents confirm, for the first time, that the agency expects that using the assessments to determine the budgets for participants’ plans will lead to “on average a reduction in the funds allocated for people’s supports”.
- It is likely to intensify calls from Labor, the Greens and the disability community for the government to scrap the proposal, which has sparked outrage in recent weeks and prompted the new minister, Linda Reynolds, to delay the rollout.
- The estimate was offered in the context of internal concerns about “significant” sustainability pressures including a projected budget blowout. Independent assessments formed part of a suite of cost-cutting measures considered by government ministers last year, the documents reveal.
- Robert announced the assessments policy in August 2020.
- It means new applicants will need to undertake an interview with an allied health professional before being granted access to the scheme – while the existing 430,000 participants would also undergo an assessment.
- Reynolds declined to answer specific questions posed by the Guardian about the contents of the documents, including the policy’s impact on the budget and funding packages.
- In a statement, she said: “Independent assessments are all about ensuring fairer and more equitable access and planning for the Australians the insurance scheme was designed to help.”
- The minister reiterated she was “consulting with NDIS providers and participants around the country about independent assessments”.
- “I won’t be finalising the implementation of independent assessments until after the trial is complete and I have met again with state and territory ministers in July,” she said.
- An NDIA spokesperson referred questions to Reynolds’ office.
- Last week, Reynolds said she would pause the rollout of the assessments, which was due to begin in the middle of the year, but there is no suggestion it will not go ahead once that is completed.
- At a parliamentary hearing on Friday, Bruce Bonyhady, the inaugural chairman of the NDIA and an original architect of the scheme, blasted the policy as “robo-planning”.
- “Robo-planning will blow up the NDIS,” Bonyhady said, adding the “real driver of all this is cost-cutting”.
- “The fact that robo-planning has reached the current stage of implementation is a disgrace,” he said. “It should have been stopped long before now.”
- Publicly, the agency has argued the free assessments will make the scheme fairer by reducing inequality and improving the consistency of funding package decisions.
- “Independent assessments are not an attempt to remove supports for people with permanent and significant disability or to prevent them from accessing the NDIS,” the agency said in its submission to a parliamentary inquiry.
- “Rather, the rollout of independent assessments is intended to ensure that the people the NDIS was intended to support are supported to become participants and go on to receive a personalised plan budget which they can then use flexibly, with more choice and control.”
- However, the agency has previously linked the assessments to the scheme’s sustainability, a euphemism for budget pressures, including in its last annual report. It is understood the issue of costings for the policy was raised by state and territory ministers at a disability reform council meeting chaired by Reynolds last week.
- The agency has already signed contracts with eight companies worth $339m to carry out the assessments.
- It has been roiled by leaks in recent weeks, as it faces internal and public opposition to the new assessments policy and a wider overhaul of the NDIS Act that determines who can access the scheme and what supports they can receive.
- An internal NDIA memo, published in full by Guardian Australia this month, outlined the creation of a new Sustainability Action Taskforce, which was quickly dubbed a secret “razor-gang” by critics.
- Separate leaked documents revealed the agency hired an “external research company” to help create a “new narrative” to craft its promotion of controversial policy changes, including the introduction of independent assessments.
- The focus group research found staff were “struggling” and were concerned they “cannot adequately support participants” through the changes.
- It also found the agency needed to be more transparent about scheme “sustainability” “even if the outcome is not liked – transparency is important”.

- NDIS Minister says independent assessments model is 'dead', in win for disability advocates
- State and territory disability ministers have shot down controversial reforms to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), in what advocates say is a huge win for the disability community.
- For months, disability advocates have been warning against the changes, which would have forced all NDIS participants and people wanting to access the scheme to undergo independent assessments.
- The federal government announced its plan to introduce the functional assessments in August last year, and the NDIS has trialled the program.
- But after a meeting between disability ministers today, NDIS Minister Linda Reynolds confirmed the federal government would not push ahead with the proposal.
- "I can absolutely confirm that we agreed with the Independent Advisory Council's recommendation that the independent assessments in their current form will not proceed," she told the ABC.
- "So are independent assessments as we currently understand them dead? Yes, they are."

- The move has been welcomed by disability advocates, who had argued the independent assessments plan was not fair.
- "We are glad that the state and territory disability ministers have listened to the thousands of people with disability and their families who have contacted them this week to ask them to say no to the NDIS independent assessments," said El Gibbs, from campaign group Every Australian Counts.
- "We have worked together for months to raise our voices and say that these changes were wrong."
- The independent assessments program would have involved an allied health professional, unknown to the person with disability, either meeting with the prospective participant face-to-face or holding a teleconference assessment.
- That assessment would have determined someone's eligibility for an NDIS funding plan.
- Currently, a person's usual doctors, specialists and allied health professionals provide reports to determine if someone is eligible for an NDIS plan.
- The federal government had always maintained that independent assessments were an original part of the NDIS and would make it fair and equitable for everyone.
- But many in the disability community said it was a box-ticking exercise designed to cut costs.
- More than 20 disability organisations call on the government to abandon a plan they say will force anyone receiving NDIS funding to discuss their support needs with an independent assessor in less than three hours.
- Opposition to independent assessments grew steadily last year within the sector, and in February more than 20 organisations, led by Every Australian Counts, called on the government to abandon the plan.
- One of the architects of the NDIS had also criticised the independent assessments model.
- Ms Reynolds said introducing assessments in some form was important for "fairness and equity" in accessing the NDIS.
- She said while independent assessments were getting ditched, disability ministers would work together to develop a new method.
- "We've agreed to work together in a way that hears more clearly the voices of those with lived experience of disability that is based on the principles of equity and fairness," she said.
- "So we did agree to work together on a new model [for assessments], and I'm very grateful to them for that agreement."
- The Opposition's NDIS spokesperson, Bill Shorten, said abandoning the independent assessments plan was "great news".
- "Independent assessments are dead, at least dead for the time being, no laws are being put into Parliament, it's back to the drawing board," he said.
