- Tesla China has pledged its full cooperation to authorities’ investigation following a Model 3 crash in Rui’an, Wenzhou, Zhejiang province. One of the vehicle’s occupants passed away, and the driver was injured due to the incident.
- The Rui’an traffic police reported that on February 17, the ill-fated Tesla Model 3 crashed into a bus after speeding through urban roads. Surveillance footage around the area showed the vehicle nearly crashing into an electric bicycle and several cars at an intersection before it stopped. At the time of the impact, the vehicle’s brake lights do not seem to be engaged.
- The Model 3 was going so fast that after passing over a bridge, the vehicle almost landed on its front end. The Tesla’s impact against the bus was massive, with a local police bulletin stating that the incident injured the driver, killed an occupant of the Model 3, and damaged three other cars in the area.
- Tesla China informed Shanghai Securities News that it was very sad about the incident. The company also pledged to work fully with investigators to determine what caused the crash. The EV maker further urged people to not spread unverified information until the results of the investigation are completed.
- “We are very sad about this accident. We fully understand everyone’s concern about this accident. Currently, the local traffic police are investigating the cause of the crash, and we will do our best to cooperate with the authorities. We also ask everyone not to believe or spread unconfirmed information,” Tesla China noted.
- Tesla China’s request comes amidst rumors emerging about the crash online, some of whom have pointed the blame to a potential fault in the vehicle. The company has been subjected to such allegations in the past, with many claiming that its cars have “brake problems” that can cause crashes. So far, however, most investigations have determined that crashes are caused by driver error, not alleged brake issues.

- The Tesla Model 3 caught air speeding over a bridge, narrowly avoided two cars, and then smashed into the bus
- Terrifying security camera vision has emerged out of China that shows the moment a speeding Tesla Model 3 crashed into a bus and an Audi.
- The accident occurred on February 17 in the city of Ruian, located within the Zhejiang province. CCTV footage initially shows the driver of the dark blue Tesla speeding over a bridge before the EV hits a bump, gets slightly airborne, and the rear-end climbs towards the sky. For a brief moment, the Model 3 nosedives along the bridge before the rear wheels slam back onto the road.
- The driver of the Tesla then speeds towards a busy intersection, cutting between two white cars and coming within inches of taking both of them out. The car continues on before slamming into the rear of a bus, jolting the bus forward. The Tesla only came to a rest after slamming into a silver Audi parked on the side of the road.

- Initial reports out of China claimed that the passenger of the Model 3 was fatally injured in the crash but later reports surfaced in the day suggesting that the passenger survived the crash and both the passenger and the driver were transported to a local hospital. Car News China notes that the local police force hasn’t commented on the crash.
- It is unclear if the crash was solely the result of reckless driving or if there were other factors involved, such as possible issues with the car itself. We have no doubt that Tesla will investigate the crash to determine the cause.
- “We are also very sad about this accident,” a Tesla China spokesperson said after the crash. “We understand everyone’s concern about this accident. At present, the cause of the accident is under investigation by the local traffic police. Fully cooperate. Please also do not believe and spread unverified information.”

- On February 17, Tesla Model 3 was spotted speeding through the Chinese city of Ruian in Zhejiang province. After a wild drive on city streets, the car almost jumped over the bridge, changed lines, crashed into a bus, and Audi parked on the side of the door.
- According to local media, the passenger died, and the driver was taken to the hospital after being rescued by nearby walkers. Later report claimed that no person died, and both driver and passenger were taken to the hospital. As of the publication of this article, neither Tesla nor Traffic police didn’t issue a response. We will keep monitoring the situation.
- CCTV video shows Model 3 driving at high speed through urban roads, and while passing through the bridge, the car jumped, resulting in the front of the car almost touching the ground, and nearly crashing. Later the car fiercely changed lanes, barely avoiding scooters and cyclists driving in the opposite direction, finally stopping by a rear crash into a bus, throwing the Model 3 into the side where it crashed parked Audi and finished its dramatic ride.
- The reports say several people on the site were injured when the ambulance arrived.
- In November, Tesla Model Y experienced a similarly wild ride in the city of Taizhou, resulting in a fatal crash, leaving three injured people, including the driver, and two deaths. The car was driving over 100km/h for 2.6 km. The results of the investigation were not yet disclosed.
- Previously, there have been accusations of malfunctioning brake pedals in Tesla cars. A Chinese customer even staged a protest at the Shanghai Auto Show, claiming that her accident was caused by brake failure. However, Tesla responded to these complaints by stating that their vehicles do not have any unintended acceleration.
- These complaints are not restricted to China, with many customers in the US also expressing concerns. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigated these complaints. It determined that the incidents of sudden unintended acceleration in Tesla cars were not caused by any design flaw but rather by driver error. The NHTSA emphasizes the need for drivers to be cautious and aware of a pedal error, which is responsible for around 16,000 crashes annually in the US.
- However, this didn’t prevent many local media from referring to the accidents as ‘brake failure’ or ‘pedal acceleration’ accidents and Weibo users accusing Tesla of selling dangerous cars. Tesla previously took legal action against some social media users claiming brake failure. This resulted in one case when the driver admitted he staged the video and apologized to the US automaker.
- What is essential is that the November 2022 accident, despite going viral, didn’t have such wide negative coverage in Chinese media as the ‘brake failures’ in 2021. Very few articles, which CarNewsChina analyzed, accused Tesla directly. The reports were much more unbiased, discussing waiting for investigation results and highlighting Tesla’s cooperation with authorities. That was different from 2021 and hinted that Tesla is again enjoying high-level support in China. We will closely watch the media’s reaction to this incident as it will indicate how much in favor Tesla is in China in 2023.

- We in the West, cannot understand you Chinese Folk’s seeming continuous fascination, with every report of ‘a Tesla crash’, when in every one of these reports that I have ever seen, it has always, been proven, to be simply as a direct result of the extremely bad, driving actions, of the ..idiot, behind the Tesla’s Steering Wheel..! Maybe, you should simply ban, ..idiot drivers, from owning Teslas, in your country.
- Well, on that week I spent 15hours writing a in depth report about one Chinese automaker. This Tesla article had 10x more views then this report. We have only 6% of readers from China. So I don’ t think the obsession with Tesla crashes is only in China, but pretty worldwide fenomenom.
- And btw I’m European.
- Just look on every car site, lots of western news outlets report on Tesla crashes, this site just reports on China

- Tesla Autopilot has been making headlines for all the wrong headlines for quite some time and it seems the latest one is from China. A Tesla Model 3 electric compact sedan hit three cars in Rui’an, Wenzhou, Zhejiang province of China before crashing into a bus. The accident took place on February 17 and killed one occupant of the EV, while the driver was injured.
- Surveillance footage around the area has shown the electric vehicle almost crashing into an electric bicycle and several cars at an intersection before it came to a complete stop. Also, the car's brake light was not engaged during the accident, which raised the suspicion that the accident had Autopilot technology involved.

- While it is not confirmed yet if the Autopilot on the fateful Tesla Model 3 was on or not, the advanced driver assistance system is under the radar again after this accident. This comes at a time when the Autopilot driver assistance technology is already under scanner in the US, as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is probing into several accidents that took place in the country involving Tesla EVs that had the Autopilot on. No wonder, the latest incident in China will increase the headache for the EV manufacturer. Tesla China has already pledged that it will fully cooperate with the authority's investigation into the accident.
- The surveillance footage also revealed that the Tesla Model 3 was going so fast that after passing over a bridge, the EV almost landed on its front end. Its impact on the bus was massive. The EV hit three other cars before crashing into the bus, revealed a local police bulletin.
- Speaking about the incident, Tesla China has issued a statement, urging people to not spread unverified information. Tesla China’s request comes amidst rumours emerging about the crash online, some of whom have pointed the blame to a potential fault in the EV. “We are very sad about this accident. We fully understand everyone’s concern about this accident. Currently, the local traffic police are investigating the cause of the crash, and we will do our best to cooperate with the authorities. We also ask everyone not to believe or spread unconfirmed information," Tesla China noted in its statement.
