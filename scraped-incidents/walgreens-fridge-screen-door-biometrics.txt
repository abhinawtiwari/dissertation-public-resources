- Walgreens and other US retailers are increasingly using Cooler Screens digital screens in place of traditional refrigerated doors in order to show customers personalised real-time adverts from Coca-Cola, Nestle, and others, and to increase sales.
- The use of the technology is proving controversial, with customers and commentators claiming they are unnecessary, creepy, and intrusive. Walgreens first piloted the Cooler Screens system in Chicago in January 2019.
- The use of Cooler Screens has attracted considerable concerns and criticism:
- Appropriateness/need: Some people complain the Cooler Screens system are unnecessary and overly 'in-your-face'.
- Privacy: Cooler Screens says all data collected by its system is anonymised system; yet it has been described as overly 'in-your-face' and 'intrusive' and its initial pilot at Walgreens Chicago raised concerns about cameras reputedly installed to guess a customer's age, gender, and mood. Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, described Walgreens use of the system as 'The creepy factor here is definitely a 10 out of 10.'
- Scope creep/normalisation: Cooler Screens says it is keen to expand its system across retailer's operations. Walgreens says future enhancements such as voice recognition will be 'carefully reviewed and considered in light of any consumer privacy concerns'.
- Cooler Screens says it plans to educate customers about the digital displays and launch features such as voice recognition. However, customers are still not informed that they are being tracked by sensors and cameras.
- Furthermore, per The Takeout, Cooler Screens claim that '90%+ of consumers no longer prefer traditional glass cooler doors' may be 'extremely inflated' given only two thousand people were surveyed.

- CHICAGO (PRWEB)
January 10, 2020
- Cooler Screens today announced Walgreens is expanding its deployment of Cooler Screens’ first-of-its-kind digital merchandising and media platform.
- Following a successful year-long trial at six locations that received very positive consumer feedback, Walgreens has rolled out the Cooler Screens platform to 50 stores in the greater Chicago area. Upon successful implementation of this roll-out, Cooler Screens will expand its platform into 2,500 Walgreens stores across the U.S.
- This expansion, the largest installation of Cooler Screens’ technology, is expected to reach over 75 million consumers monthly, including 2.5 million in-store consumers on a daily basis. By embracing this new technology, Walgreens is pioneering the convergence of physical and digital retail as the first retailer to digitally transform the consumer shopping experience in the cooler aisle.
- “We are thrilled to be working with Walgreens to deliver our shared vision for the future of physical retail with hundreds of stores and millions of consumers across the country,” said Cooler Screens CEO and Co-Founder, Arsen Avakian. “The opportunity is to not only delight consumers with new, safe, digitally-powered experiences but also to evolve the business of bricks-and-mortar retail.  Working with Walgreens, we are demonstrating the value of this new approach at scale.”
- Cooler Screens is a Chicago-based company reimagining the consumer experience in bricks-and-mortar retail. Cooler Screens has developed a proprietary digital merchandizing platform that replaces the traditional cooler doors in the cooler aisle.  As a result, consumers experience in-store what they love about shopping on-line. With simplified access to the latest and most relevant information, consumers can now make more informed in-store decisions that best fit their budgets, taste and health preferences. Direct feedback from consumers who have experienced Cooler Screens has been overwhelmingly positive. Surveys from pilot locations reported over 80 percent of respondents thought it was easier to find products and the products were more appealing, and over 90 percent no longer preferred the traditional coolers.
- “Walgreens is committed to exploring digital innovation that can deliver new and different experiences for our customers, and Cooler Screens has developed a technology that transforms how customers shop for refrigerated items in the cooler aisle,” said Richard Ashworth, President of Operations, Walgreens. “The expansion of the pilot allows us to bring an innovative solution to our stores that brings the power of digital technology to physical retail.”
- The Cooler Screens platform also offers new business opportunities for both retailers and consumer product brands. With Cooler Screens, bricks-and-mortar retailers meet the demands of today’s digitally savvy consumers. Cooler Screens data shows that purchases from the coolers increase, lifting same store sales. Further, retailers are able to gain efficiencies with digitized merchandizing, improve visibility with real-time out-of-stock analytics, and access new revenue streams by entering the digital media business and providing brands access to their massive consumer audiences. This positive business impact for retailers has been clearly demonstrated in Walgreens pilot stores.
- Furthermore, product brands are able for the first time to directly digitally engage consumers in the cooler aisle and deliver contextually relevant offerings and messaging at point-of-sale. This new channel allows brands to not only build equity but also influence purchasing and gain timely visibility into promotion engagement and effectiveness. To access these benefits, more than 20 of the top consumer brands have joined the Cooler Screens marketplace including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, MillerCoors, Tyson, Conagra, Chobani, Red Bull, and Monster.
- Cooler Screens is a consumer-safe platform that avoids the privacy risks of other digital commerce platforms by never gathering or storing personally identifiable information. Cooler Screens’ model for digital retail is ‘identity-blind’ and is a leading digital retail technology actively incorporating the global Privacy by Design (PbD) framework developed by international privacy experts and advocates to protect user privacy.
- To help build and deliver this pioneering platform, Cooler Screens has established strategic partnerships with global segment leaders including Dover for digital refrigeration infrastructure; Microsoft for cloud, edge computing, IoT and AI; and Verizon for 4G/5G connectivity, security, and managed services. Other key technology partners include BOE and Foxconn, the world’s largest high-tech manufacturers of LED/LCD components and electronics.

- Did your latest stroll through the refrigerated and frozen food aisles at Walgreens feel more high-tech than normal?
- The pharmacy chain has recently rolled out digital screens replacing the traditional doors available in these sections, and some consumers are upset.
- The high-tech doors were created in partnership with startup Cooler Screens, a company building technology where "consumers experience in-store what they love about shopping on-line."
- In 2020, Cooler Screens announced plans to roll out the screens to 50 Walgreens stores in the Chicago area. After that rollout, the company said the digital screens would expand to an additional 2,500 Walgreens locations across the U.S.
- According to a video posted to YouTube last September, the digital doors are capable of displaying full-screen ads, and will recognize when a shopper walks past. The screen then changes to show which items are available inside the cooler. Retailers could also promote sales digitally through the touchscreen instead of using additional physical signs.
- A demo of the doors available on Cooler Screens' website shows how users can view nutrition information and reviews of products directly from the screen. The doors can also recommend other products for shoppers depending on what they pick from the cooler.
- Similar signs have popped up at fast food restaurants including McDonald's, which uses digital menus in its drive thru.
- Walgreens confirmed to USA TODAY it launched the pilot with Cooler Screens in 2019, and the technology is currently available in less than 700 stores.
- In a statement to CNN, the company said it is "committed to exploring digital innovation in (an) effort to deliver new and different experiences for our customers."
- Some consumers are not fans of the innovation. "They replaced the Walgreens here with these screens and I hate them with a passion," wrote one Twitter user who goes by the handle @Infosec_Taylor.
- "The stupid cooler screens make me not want to shop there anymore. Annoying confusing I don't want advertisement in my face constantly," wrote another Twitter user who goes by the handle @Simone64431199.

- Technology has once again gone too far. Walgreens is rolling out more and more digital fridge and freezer doors from Cooler Screens—CNN reports that there are about 10,000 screens out there at the moment—and customers are confused. The way these doors work is that they display an exact digital image of what is in the cooler so customers can choose what they want before opening the door (ya know, kind of like what clear glass does). But before allowing customers to grab their favorite convenience store treat, a flashy ad for a specific brand plays on the screen.
- Cooler Screens seems to want us to think this was our idea. “90%+ of consumers no longer prefer traditional glass cooler doors,” its website boasts. But the fine print shows only a couple thousand people were surveyed to reach this number, and the internet’s initial reaction to seeing the screens in stores seems to suggest that percentage may be extremely inflated.
- Both Cooler Screens and Walgreens are touting that they’re solving a major problem in the physical retail space, but what’s still unclear is exactly what problem they think they’re solving.
- The appeal to brands is clear: the Cooler Screens doors play targeted digital ads for various products behind the cooler door before actually showing the entirety of what’s available. Technology tracks when a customer is stopped outside a door, and because of that Cooler Screens says on its website that it has tracked 100% verified views at “the moment of truth,” or the seconds before the consumer decides what they’ll actually grab.
- These ads benefit the stores in which the Cooler Screens are placed, too—retailers get a cut of the digital spots bought by brands. It’s no wonder businesses like Target and Walgreens would be on board with the extra money going straight into their pockets.
- The business behind these strange cooler doors states its goal is to bring the “science of e-commerce to brick-and-mortar retail.” The site claims that “Consumer experience is at the heart of our design.” The supplemental details that follow suggest that the main part of the consumer experience they’re thinking about is privacy, assuring us that the technology is “identity-blind” and not tracking any details about the customers who come into contact with these doors. That’s all well and good, but that still doesn’t quite reveal how the actual on-the-spot, about-to-buy-a-Diet-Coke experience is in any way centered around the consumer.
- A Walgreens spokesperson tells CNN that the digital coolers present customers with “relevant product information” that helps them decide what to buy. Internal cameras track inventory of what’s in the coolers and display that information on the screen. Of course, you don’t get to see that information until after an ad plays—an ad for a product that may or may not be the one you’re hunting for. It’s almost as if simply opening a cooler door and looking inside would give you the same information in a much more efficient manner.
- Cooler Screens does have plans to launch future features like voice recognition, allowing shoppers to ask questions about prices or item locations. This feels at least like a step in the direction of considering what customers may actually want out of this technology, but that will likely raise the question of privacy all over again.
- Maybe the company won’t even make it that far. If the people of TikTok aren’t happy with Cooler Screens, then those screens may not be long for this world.

- Fear & Greed Index
- Latest Market News
- Walgreens and other retailers have swapped out the clear fridge and freezer doors at thousands of stores, instead adding opaque doors with iPad-like screens showing what’s inside. Some customers really, really aren’t into it.
- The screens, which were developed by the startup Cooler Screens, use a system of motion sensors and cameras to display what’s inside the doors — as well as product information, prices, deals and, most appealing to brands, paid advertisements. The tech provides stores with an additional revenue stream and a way to modernize the shopping experience.
- But for customers who just want to peek into the freezer and grab their ice cream, Walgreens
            
                (WBA) risks angering them by solving a problem that shoppers didn’t know existed.
- The company wants to engage more people with advertising, but the reaction, so far, is annoyance and confusion.
- “Why would Walgreens do this?” one befuddled shopper who encountered the screens posted on TikTok. “Who on God’s green earth thought this was a good idea?”
- “The digital cooler screens at Walgreens made me watch an ad before it allowed me to know which door held the frozen pizzas,” said someone on Twitter.
- Another echoed: “@Walgreens NOBODY needs TV screen replacing doors in your cooler aisles…. Stop.”
- Retailers are eager to add new experiences to their physical stores. But many consumers aren’t eager to change their habits — and they certainly aren’t used to watching freezer-display ads.
- “People really appreciate their routines. They’re not always seeking excitement,” said Julio Sevilla, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Georgia who studies consumer behavior.
- Digital screens, he said, can add uncertainty and physical barriers to a simple and literally transparent process: reaching into a glass fridge.
- Sevilla doesn’t believe consumers are looking for novelty when they visit a grocery store: “We all love to get into a supermarket and know exactly what we’re getting. I know also exactly where things are. For this type of utilitarian-related setting, people like their certainty and simplicity.”
- Still, Walgreens
            
                (WBA) and Cooler Screens are pushing forward. Walgreens
            
                (WBA) began testing the screens in 2018 and has since expanded the pilot to a couple thousand locations nationwide.
- Several other major retailers are launching their own tests with Cooler Screens, including Kroger
            
                (KR), CVS
            
                (CVS), GetGo convenience stores and Chevron
            
                (CVX) gas stations.
- “I hope that we will one day be able to expand across all parts of the store,” said Cooler Screens co-founder and CEO Arsen Avakian in an interview with CNN Business.
- Currently the startup has about 10,000 screens in stores, which are viewed by approximately 90 million consumers monthly, according to the company. Avakian said the company aims to bring its digital displays to a broad range of retailers including those in beauty, consumer electronics and home improvement.
- A Walgreens spokesperson said in an email that Walgreens is “committed to exploring digital innovation in [an] effort to deliver new and different experiences for our customers.”
- The spokesperson said the screens add value because they give customers relevant product information to help them decide what to buy, and that Walgreens is evaluating the pilot to decide whether to expand further.
- Though not all of Walgreens’ customers are fans, Cooler Screens’ concept has attracted prominent brands like Coke
            
                (KO), Pepsi
            
                (PEP), Nestle
            
                (NSRGF), Kraft Heinz
            
                (KHC) and Monster
            
                (MNST). It’s raised more than $100 million from backers including Microsoft
            
                (MSFT) and Verizon
            
                (VZ).
- Cooler Screens CEO Avakian said he developed the concept after watching in-store customers whip out their phones to find product information and reviews. Traditionally, in-store advertising has been limited to options like signs, promotions and prominent placement on shelves. But Cooler Screens’ targeted digital ads deliver at the “moment of truth,” Avakian said, right as consumers decide which product to pull out of the fridge.
- How Heinz uses a fake number to keep its brand timeless
- Brands can place ads spread over multiple freezers, ones that display products’ nutritional labels, or ads triggered by weather or time of day. An ice cream company might want to run ads when it’s hot outside, while a coffee brand could hit the morning rush.
- The setup aims to help stores add high-margin advertising revenue to offset their core low-margin retail business. Companies pay Cooler Screens to run screen ads and retailers get a cut.
- “There’s a big movement in retail right now to create what’s called a ‘retail media network,’ which taps into all the ways brands can interact with that retailer digitally,” said Chris Walton, a former vice president at Target who runs the retail blog Omni Talk.
- Cooler Screens says 90% of consumers it has surveyed prefer its digital screens to traditional fridges, and that the displays provide sales lifts for stores. (Walgreens did not comment on that.)
- But beyond the confused social media posts, the tech has also attracted misinformation and conspiracy theories. Politifact last month debunked a viral Facebook video that claimed “Walgreens refrigerators are scanning shoppers’ hands and foreheads for ‘the mark of the beast.’”
- Avakian insists the tech is “identity-blind” and protects consumers’ privacy. The freezers have front-facing sensors used to anonymously track shoppers interacting with the platform, while internally facing cameras track product inventory.
- Some customers have expressed frustration with the experience. People aren’t sure whether to tap the screens or talk to them. The items on display don’t always match up with what’s inside because products are out of stock.
- Henry Brewer, who recently encountered one of the digital screens at a Walgreens in Chicago, said the technology felt “very in-your-face” and “intrusive.”
- “We see advertisements literally everywhere and now I have to go see it on the cooler?” he said. “It doesn’t just seem necessary, and I think it’s a turnoff to the consumer when this wasn’t a problem.”
- To Avakian, it’s simply an expected growing pain. Cooler Screens plans to educate customers about the digital displays and launch features like voice recognition, so shoppers can ask about prices or item locations.
- “This is the future of retail and shopping,” Avakian said.

- Our only agenda is to publish the truth so you can be an informed participant in democracy.
We need your help.
- More Info
- This March 7, 2019, photo shows cooler doors with cameras and sensors at a Walgreens in Chicago. Instead of the usual clear glass doors that allow customers to see inside, there are video screens that display targeted ads. (AP)
- • Cooler Screens are designed to provide targeted advertising and promotions based on shoppers’ behaviors and other factors. They are not scanning people for a specific “mark.”
- • Cooler Screens maintains its system is incapable of collecting specific personal information like vaccine status.
- • There is no evidence to suggest Cooler Screens’ technology is collecting data on who is vaccinated against COVID-19 or that it will ban people from shopping. It is designed to get people to buy.
- At some Walgreens locations, shoppers are being monitored by the refrigerator doors as they browse the aisles.
- The retail pharmacy chain has started using Cooler Screens technology at thousands of Walgreens stores across the U.S. The technology relies on cameras and sensors to determine some of a shopper’s general behaviors and characteristics, which are then used to provide targeted advertising, according to the Wall Street Journal and Fast Company.
- If a shopper grabs a six-pack of beer near dinner time, the cooler doors might display a promotion on frozen pizzas, for example, Cooler Screens’ CEO Arsen Avakian told Fast Company.
- "So I’m here at Walgreens," said one TikTok user, whose video was shared on Facebook. He turned the camera to show a line of refrigerators along one wall of the store. "They look like normal shelves, but they’re not normal shelves. Every single one of them has infrared scanning sensors for your forehead, right? The mark of the beast on your right hand or your forehead."
- The person narrating the video continues, saying that the refrigerator doors are made out of "super thick metal."
- "If you don’t have the mark later on, you won’t be able to buy," he said.
- In the full-length version of the TikTok, which appears to have been removed from TikTok but is posted on Reddit, his claim continues. In the future, he said, the refrigerator doors will be locked unless shoppers scan their hands or foreheads.
- "Without the mark of the beast, you won’t be able to use these in the future," he said. "These lock. Right now they’re not locked, but they do lock."
- A few seconds later, he clarified: "This is all just the beginning — certificate of vaccine ID. COVID. You won’t be able to buy or sell unless you can prove that you’re fully vaccinated. They’re going to collapse the economies and then bring in digital currency."
- The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
- This TikTok user is not the first person to refer to COVID-19 vaccines — or proof of vaccinations — as "the mark of the beast," a religious term referenced in Revelation, the last book of the New Testament. Evangelical Christians have cited this text throughout history as a sign of the antichrist. (Both credit cards and social security numbers have been theorized to be the long-feared mark. In the 1970s, grocery store UPC bar codes became suspect.)
- But while the question of whether COVID-19 vaccines are the "mark of the beast" may be open to religious interpretation, another question remains. Are the Cooler Screens at Walgreens meant to detect markings and prevent people who lack those markings from shopping? No.
- Quite the opposite: Cooler Screens freezer and refrigerator doors are designed to provide targeted advertisements to shoppers — with the ultimate hope that they will buy.
- It’s not clear how the speaker in the video arrived at this conclusion, but the belief also appears to be rooted in an interpretation of the biblical text. Revelation 13:16-17 reads: "It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name."
- The whole point of a company advertising something is so that consumers will purchase.
- The Cooler Screens doors are "equipped with a camera, motion sensors, and eye tracking," according to a 2019 Fast Company article. "The doors can discern your gender, your general age range, what products you’re looking at, how long you’re standing there, and even what your emotional response is to a particular product."
- The Cooler Screens FAQ page addresses the cameras and sensors the doors rely on. Three "internally facing cameras" are used to track product inventory while "front-facing optical sensors" are used to "anonymously track consumer presence and interaction with the platform."
- "These optical sensors never capture or store images or any other data that at any time cloud [sic] be linked back to an individual consumer," Cooler Screens wrote.
- A more recent article from last year contradicted some of the claims the Fast Company story made about the Cooler Screens doors.
- "Though the sensors don’t use facial-recognition technology and can’t tell gender or other identifiable data, they can give advertisers a sense of how their ads are actually leading to in-store purchases," according to a Marketing Brew piece.
- Regardless, the screens on the doors will display advertisements and promotions that are believed to be relevant to particular shoppers based on the information gathered by the sensors.
- According to Cooler Screens, the data it collects is anonymous, meaning it is not tied to a particular individual, as, say, Facebook and Instagram are.
- "Cooler Screens never seeks to identify individuals and never gathers or uses personally identifiable or linkable information," the company wrote on its FAQ page. "Our technology does not support it. Our business model does not require it."
- PolitiFact reached out to Cooler Screens, Walgreens and Microsoft — another one of Cooler Screens’ partners.
- A spokesperson for Cooler Screens described its technology as "identity-blind and privacy-centric," and said the company had adopted the "Privacy by Design" framework, which ensures privacy safeguards are always a consideration.
- "Our external facing sensor simply detects motion — nothing more," the spokesperson said, reiterating that Cooler Screens does not gather or use personally identifiable information.
- A spokesperson for Microsoft said Cooler Screens does not use Microsoft AI to power its technology. Cooler Screens uses some Microsoft cloud services and data visualization tools.
- Walgreens did not respond to our requests for comment.
- A video shared on Facebook claims Walgreens refrigerators are scanning shoppers’ hands and foreheads looking for "the mark of the beast," which is supposedly sported by those who are vaccinated against COVID-19. The video also claims that "if you don’t have the mark later on, you won’t be able to buy."
- The Cooler Screens in the video were designed to provide targeted advertising and promotions based on shoppers’ behaviors and other factors. The Cooler Screens at Walgreens do not collect identifiable information about shoppers. They are designed to help sell products to customers, not prevent customers from buying.
- We rate this claim Pants on Fire!
- UPDATE, Jan. 12, 2022: This story has been updated with a comment from Cooler Screens. The rating is unchanged.

- Walgreens is exploring new tech that turns your purchases, your movements, even your gaze, into data.
- Walgreens is piloting a new line of “smart coolers”—fridges equipped with cameras that scan shoppers’ faces and make inferences on their age and gender. On January 14, the company announced its first trial at a store in Chicago in January, and plans to equip stores in New York and San Francisco with the tech.
- Demographic information is key to retail shopping. Retailers want to know what people are buying, segmenting shoppers by gender, age, and income (to name a few characteristics) and then targeting them precisely. To that end, these smart coolers are a marvel.
- If, for example, Pepsi launched an ad campaign targeting young women, it could use smart-cooler data to see if its campaign was working. These machines can draw all kinds of useful inferences: Maybe young men buy more Sprite if it’s displayed next to Mountain Dew. Maybe older women buy more ice cream on Thursday nights than any other day of the week. The tech also has “iris tracking” capabilities, meaning the company can collect data on which displayed items are the most looked at.
- Crucially, the “Cooler Screens” system does not use facial recognition. Shoppers aren’t identified when the fridge cameras scan their face. Instead, the cameras analyze faces to make inferences about shoppers’ age and gender. First, the camera takes their picture, which an AI system will measure and analyze, say, the width of someone’s eyes, the distance between their lips and nose, and other micro measurements. From there, the system can estimate if the person who opened the door is, say, a woman in her early 20s or a male in his late 50s. It’s analysis, not recognition.
- The distinction between the two is very important. In Illinois, facial recognition in public is outlawed under BIPA, the Biometric Privacy Act. For two years, Google and Facebook fought class-actions suits filed under the law, after plaintiffs claimed the companies obtained their facial data without their consent. Home-security cams with facial-recognition abilities, such as Nest or Amazon’s Ring, also have those features disabled in the state; even Google’s viral “art selfie” app is banned. The suit against Facebook was dismissed in January, but privacy advocates champion BIPA as a would-be template for a world where facial recognition is federally regulated.
- Walgreens’s camera system makes note only of what shoppers picked up and basic information on their age and gender. Last year, a Canadian mall used cameras to track shoppers  and make inferences about which demographics prefer which stores. Shoppers’ identities weren’t collected or stored, but the mall ended the pilot after widespread backlash.
- The smart cooler is just one of dozens of tracking technologies emerging in retail. At Amazon Go stores, for example—which do not have cashiers or self-checkout stations—sensors make note of shoppers’ purchases and charge them to their Amazon account; the resulting data are part of the feedback loop the company uses to target ads at customers, making it more money.

- NEW YORK (AP) — Eyeing that can of soda in the supermarket cooler? Or maybe you’re craving a pint of ice cream? A camera could be watching you.
- But it’s not there to see if you’re stealing. These cameras want to get to know you and what you’re buying.
- It’s a new technology being trotted out to retailers, where cameras try to guess your age, gender or mood as you walk by. The intent is to use the information to show you targeted real-time ads on in-store video screens.
- Companies are pitching retailers to bring the technology into their physical stores as a way to better compete with online rivals like Amazon that are already armed with troves of information on their customers and their buying habits.
- With store cameras, you may not even realize you are being watched unless you happen to notice the penny-sized lenses. And that has raised concerns over privacy.
- “The creepy factor here is definitely a 10 out of 10,” said Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit that researches privacy issues.
- At the National Retail Federation trade show in New York earlier this year, a smart shelf on display by Mood Media tried to detect “happiness” or “fear” as people stood in front it — information a store could use to gauge reaction to a product on the shelf or an ad on a screen. Cineplex Digital Media showed off video screens that can be placed in malls or bus stops and try to tell if someone is wearing glasses or sporting a beard, which in turn can be used to sell ads for new frames or razors.
- The screens can also be placed at the drive-thru. A minivan pulling into a fast food restaurant, for example, might get an ad for a family-sized meal on the video screen menu.
- For now, the cameras are in just a handful of stores.
- Kroger, which has 2,800 supermarkets, is testing cameras embedded in a price sign above shelves in two stores in the suburbs outside Cincinnati and Seattle. Video screens attached to the shelves can play ads and show discounts. Kroger said the cameras guess a shopper’s age and sex but the information is anonymous and the data is not being stored. If the tests work out well, the company said it could expand it into other locations.
- Walgreens 
        WBA,
        +0.13%,
       which has more than 8,000 drugstores, installed cooler doors with cameras and sensors at six locations in Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Bellevue, Washington. Instead of the usual clear glass doors that allow customers to see inside, there are video screens that display ads along with the cooler’s contents.
- Above the door handle is a camera that can try to guess ages and track irises to see where you are looking, but Walgreens said those functions are off for now. The company said the cameras are currently being used to sense when someone is in front of the cooler and count the number of shoppers passing by. It declined to say if it will turn on the other functions of the camera.
- “All such enhancements will be carefully reviewed and considered in light of any consumer privacy concerns,” Walgreens said.
- Advocates of the technology say it could benefit shoppers by showing them discounts tailored to them or drawing attention to products that are on sale. But privacy experts warn that even if the information being collected is anonymous, it can still be used in an intrusive way.
- For instance, if many people are eyeing a not-so-healthy dessert but not buying it, a store could place it at the checkout line so you see it again and “maybe your willpower breaks down,” said Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law and co-director of its Tech Policy Lab.
- “Just because a company doesn’t know exactly who you are doesn’t mean they can’t do things that will harm you,” Calo said.
- The technology could also lead to discriminatory practices, like raising prices when an older person walks in or pushing products based on your perceived mood such as ads for anti-depression medication if the cameras think you look sad, adds Dixon of the World Privacy Forum. .
- “We shouldn’t be gathering the emotional state of anyone,” Dixon said.
- At a Walgreens in New York, a sign above a rack of wines said the store is testing cameras and sensors that “do not identify you or store any images.” The sign doesn’t say where the cameras or sensors are, but it does have a web address for the privacy policy of Cooler Screens, the company that makes the doors.
- Calvin Johnson, who was looking for a Snapple, said he visited the store before, but didn’t notice the cameras until a reporter pointed them out.
- “I don’t like that at all,” Johnson said.
- Another shopper, Ray Ewan, said he noticed the lenses while grabbing a Diet Coke, but isn’t concerned since cameras are hard to avoid.
- “There’s one on each corner,” Ewan said.
- Not all retailers are keen on adding embedded cameras. Walmart’s Sam’s Club, which is testing shelves with digital price tags, is cautious about them.
- “I think the most important thing you do with tech like that is to make sure people know,” said John Furner, Sam’s Club’s CEO. “You don’t want to surprise people on how you use technology or data.”
- Jon Reily, vice president of commerce strategy at consultancy Publicis.Sapient, said retailers risk offending customers who may be shown ads that are aimed at a different gender or age group. Nonetheless, he expects the embedded cameras to be widely used in the next four years as the technology gets more accurate, costs less and shoppers become used to it.
- For now, he said, “we are still on the creepy side of the scale.”
- Nvidia said Google, Meta, and Microsoft would be among the first companies to get access to its DGX GH200 supercomputer.
