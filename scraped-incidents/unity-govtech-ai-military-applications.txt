- VICE reports that game development tool company Unity's GovTech unit is secretly working for the US Department of Defense. The work is causing unease amongst some of the gaming firm's employees, who are complaining of poor internal transparency.
- Unity responded to VICE by saying the work does not 'knowingly violate our principles or values', including that its work 'does not directly involve the loss of life, harm of the planet, or a person’s right to equity and inclusion.'
- Unity's stated AI principles include the need for honesty, clarity, and transparency.

- Unity, the popular game making tool, has long been used in industries outside of video games. Unity's site celebrates this versatility, saying its technology offers "incredible possibilities" for film, engineering, architecture, automotive, transportation, and more.
- Unity's site also proudly lists its technology being used by the government and military, but internal Unity documents obtained by Waypoint show the company is struggling to explain why its employees, who supposedly signed up to create tools that empower game makers, are now directly or inadvertently developing technologies for militaries with the stated objectives of fighting wars.
- According to three sources Waypoint talked to, some Unity employees might develop technology that ends up with military clients without even realizing that's how their work would be used. These sources, a mixture of current and former Unity employees, were granted anonymity to avoid reprisal.
- According to these sources, the part of Unity that's pursuing government and military contracts is sometimes nicknamed "GovTech," which the company described in a public presentation from March 2021 as intended to "develop technologies across our products that helps the government adapt AI and ML [machine learning]"
- One internal memo, titled "GovTech Projects - Communication Protocol," which was shared with Waypoint but not distributed widely within Unity itself, outlined how the company should talk about these contracts with "internal/external stakeholders," and makes clear Unity understands the delicate line it's walking.
- "We need to be sensitive to the various values & beliefs which people perceive our engagement with the Government, specifically DoD [Department of Defense]," reads the memo, which instructs managers to use the terms "government" or "defense" instead of "military."
- The memo is listed as a draft, isn't dated, and Waypoint's sources were unaware of a final version meant for wider distribution. It includes a list of "Do's" and "Don'ts" for Unity employees when talking about GovTech projects. Under "Do's," the memo tells employees to point out that Unity is using AI to improve how the DoD runs simulations and trainings, and that "Nothing we are doing will be used in live warfighting." The memo also instructs employees to highlight that Unity's "current projects provide a service and or solution to DoD companies and we are not taking the lead on any single project."
- Under "Don'ts," the memo instructs employees not to "discuss any projects that involves the use of simulated or virtual weapons or training to harm another person."
- A postscript on the memo also implies that Unity's work with the military is justified by the DoD's own ethical principles. "PS: It's important to note that DoD itself has published a set of AI principles that it has pledged to adhere to as it adopts AI at scale," the memo says, and links to a 2020 press release by the DoD that outlined its own "series of ethical principles" related to the research and use of military artificial intelligence. The memo highlights the following quote from the DoD press release: "The principles address these new challenges and ensure the responsible use of AI by the department."
- Unity started as a Mac-exclusive game making tool in 2005, but in 2021, it's become one of the dominant game development tools in the industry, powering everything from indie hits like Hollow Knight to big budget games like Hearthstone. Much like Unreal Engine, Unity offers game developers a variety of tools to create games. Unity is known mostly for tools that allow developers to create 3D environments and models, but developers also use it to script what happens in a game, create the software that dictates how non-player characters behave, and more. If you're regularly playing games these days, there's a good chance you've encountered the company's white cube logo on a game's opening splash screen.
- The company went public in 2020, and is currently valued at $33 billion.
- "Whether or not I'm working directly for the government team, I'm empowering the products they're selling. Do you want to use your tools to catch bad guys? Maybe we shouldn't be in the business of defining who bad guys are."
- Most Unity employees do not have immediate access to every detail about a project the company is working on. Employees can request that information from a manager in some cases, but it's rarely easy. Part of the problem, sources told us, was that not all Unity employees knew exactly what Unity was doing for the military, and if the projects that they were working on could end up supporting Unity's work for the military without them realizing.
- "Most Unity AI work empowers other government projects, so in this way it can be difficult to gauge one's contribution to government projects," said one source.
- According to one source, a Unity engineer could be working on an AI tool without a specific application in mind and have no way of knowing if another part of the company would then use that tool for a contract with the military.
- "It didn't seem very clear through company training or anything like that there even were concerns, really, in what we were doing," the source said.
- "It should be very clear when people are stepping into the military initiative part of Unity," said one source.
- According to a document Unity employees used to collect answers from managers to ethical questions, and that was shared with Waypoint, an unnamed employee noted they'd been tasked with working on what had been pitched as "a placement randomization scheme for a government simulation project." In reality, according to that unnamed employee, it was "simulating explosion debris on virtual runways" for the United States military. The same employee noted how Unity frequently used "government" to describe military projects, a practice outlined in the memo Waypoint obtained.
- "I don’t think most employees were warned that they would need philosophy degrees before accepting a position at Unity," reads a different comment from another employee. "Many of my fellow employees are very talented engineers or artists, but I don’t think that experience necessarily prepares us to be successful in passively identifying the complex repercussions of advancing certain emerging technologies."
- In response to an inquiry about this story, Unity told Waypoint that one of the company's goals is to "have applications outside of gaming." The company did not respond to a list of specific questions, which included inquiries about whether Unity employees had ever knowingly or unknowingly participated in the creation of a weapon of war and how much the company makes off its military contracts, and instead passed along a long statement included in full at the end of this article.
- In that statement, Unity said use of its technology by governments and the U.S. military "is not new" and pointed to its current and past contracts with the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, and defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Pressed for specifics on those contracts, Unity said it "can't share specific details" and said it has a "thorough review process" so the company doesn't "knowingly violate our principles or values."
- A key principle, according to Unity, is that its work for the government "does not directly involve the loss of life, harm of the planet, or a person's right to equity and inclusion." Citing confidentiality clauses, the company could not point to specifics, but brought up its internal Sales Ethics Advisory Council (SEAC) "made up of interested Unity employees from diverse backgrounds, geographics, and parts of the company." Unity said the SEAC has passed along recommendations that have resulted in declining contracts "that do not align with the principles outlined above."
- "We believe in the freedom of expression, and as the Unity engine is a tool, a tool that can be downloaded and used by most anyone, it’s impossible to truly police or censor all uses of it," Unity said.
- After Waypoint reached out for comment, Unity CEO John Riccitiello released a similar statement internally to employees over a company-wide Slack on Thursday, a copy of which was shared with Waypoint.
- "We expect a story from a VICE journalist to talk about Unity’s work with the government and military," Riccitiello wrote in the Slack message. "The contracts for these engagements are very restrictive - similar to many of our partnership deals including some of the work we do with gaming companies and in verticals such as retail - so while we can’t share specific details, we can say that we have a thorough review process, and we have not nor will we support programs where we knowingly violate our principles or values."
- After Unity went public in 2020, it pursued expansion into other sectors, which has in recent years included artificial intelligence contracts with the U.S. government, specifically the military.
- "At Unity, we fundamentally believe the world is a better place with more creators in it," wrote the company in a blog post about its "principles for ethical AI" in 2018. "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a key component of that mission."
- That same blog laid out a few specific goals for the company's initiatives, including one called "be accountable," wherein Unity would "consider the potential negative consequences of the AI tools we build" and "anticipate what might cause potential direct or indirect harm." Another point, called "be fair," outlined how Unity would not "knowingly develop AI tools and experiences that interfere with normal, functioning democratic systems of government."
- "I don’t think most employees were warned that they would need philosophy degrees before accepting a position at Unity.”
- Unity's work with the government isn't a secret—there's a giant promotion for this collaboration on Unity's website—but its existence has created tension, thanks to the increasingly contentious merging of the military and AI.
- "This has been largely received poorly internally for those that know about it," said one source.
- Waypoint uncovered three government contracts with Unity in 2020 alone, including a $428,000 contract in June 2020 with the U.S. Air Force for a "modeling & simulation prototype" that would function as a "multi-domain operations advanced battle management family of systems." The Air Force signed a new $220,583 contract with Unity with the same description in October 2020, as well. The third contract for $23,500 was for a Unity Pro subscription for the U.S Army. The online records also showed the Navy paying for Unity licenses in the past, including in 2012 for $4,800.
- If you work at Unity and want to provide details on the work being done there with the government, Patrick’s email is patrick.klepek@vice.com, and he is privately on Signal (224-707-1561).
- An internal presentation titled "Unity AI for government" breaks up the company's strategy in this space into three stages: Crawl (adoption), Walk (recurring revenue), and Run (self service). In the first "adoption" phase, the presentation says Unity aims to enable developers by "hiring thought leaders and subject matter experts," building a "cadre of govt and systems integrator evangelists," and raising awareness by promoting "purpose-built demos" and educating "the government community."
- The presentation then goes on to explain the "Government AI opportunity" by listing how much difference governments spend on AI, showing that U.S. defense and intelligence spent $1.4 billion in 2020, the most on the list and a 43 percent increase over 2019. It also lists Unity's "key products" in this space, including "Robotics," which is detailed as "Prototype robotics systems, test robotic applications, train robotics algorithms and operate robots with simulation." Another key product is "Computer Vision," and a different slide in the presentation mentions a case study for "Dangerous Object Detection," and shows a computer vision model to "detect bats, guns, and knives."
- An image from a Unity presentation about one of its AI projects.
- One example of how the Department of Defense uses Unity is RIDE (Rapid Integration & Development Environment), a simulation creation platform made at the University of Southern California that is, according to the university's own website, "in direct support of Department of Defense-funded research" and sponsored by a contract with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. While it's built to support other game engines, it's originally made in Unity.
- A video promoting RIDE mentions incorporating "cutting-edge artificial intelligence research," while showcasing simulations involving piloting a tank, a group of soldiers firing weapons, and more. A June 2021 article profiling RIDE in SIGNAL Magazine, a publication focused on topics like information security and "homeland security," noted RIDE would eventually include "AI to enhance the behaviors of simulated characters, including enemy forces," because "military simulations need to accurately depict behaviors of civilian populations."
- Unity also conducts private conferences pushing Unity's applications for the military. This past March, Unity hosted a talk about "applied research & prototyping in defense applications" specifically meant to showcase "Unity's latest technological developments for applications in the government sector." The guests included developers on the RIDE project.
- "We are here and committed to being the U.S. government's real-time 3D platform of choice," said Unity head of government solutions John Cunningham during the talk. "Our government team is acutely focused on identifying how we can leverage [new Unity] technologies for government and defense and even to develop new products if necessary."
- All three sources told Waypoint the current debates at Unity about government contracts can be traced back to the company's decision to partner with the oil and gas company Schlumberger in 2019. The Guardian once described Schlumberber as "the oil world's most secretive operator" and "the biggest company you've never heard of." The company operates all over the world and was fined $155 million in 2015 for violating sanctions in both Iran and Sudan.
- As part of the 2019 partnership, Unity helped Schlumberger move its data into the cloud. But this deal sparked an internal backlash at Unity and arrived simultaneously with increased scrutiny from Unity employees about the contracts the GovTech department was prioritizing.
- "There was an increasing trend for the AI org to focus on GovTech professional services projects," said one source. "This felt uncomfortably close to the military."
- At an all-hands meeting this year, according to one source, an employee submitted an anonymous question asking if there were any GovTech partnerships at Unity that didn't involve the Department of Defense. The company could only name one.
- The backlash to the Schlumberger deal and the increased ethical concerns caused Unity to form the Sales Ethics Advisory Council (SEAC), according to Waypoint's sources. Unity said SEAC was the result of "a series of company-wide roundtables with hundreds of Unity employees a couple of years ago."
- In theory, the SEAC would vet new projects and hand recommendations to executives, including CEO John Riccitiello. Riccitiello was president and COO of Electronic Arts from 1997 to 2004. He left, then returned as CEO from 2007 to 2013, before ultimately becoming Unity's CEO in 2014.

- Similar ethics groups have become trendy in Silicon Valley. In March 2019, Google announced a similar "council" for its own AI programs, to "guide the responsible development and use of AI in our research and products." Immediately, one person Google initially announced to be on that council said they would decline the invitation. A petition resulted in another person resigning. Less than a month later, the whole initiative was disbanded.
- One of the chief criticisms of the council, according to Waypoint's sources, is the lack of transparency about how the council operates, when and why it decides to review a potentially problematic contract, and how it comes to a decision. Frequently, employees are given limited insight on a project and may not have the whole picture on how a given technology might be used in the future, or the possible negative consequences. They're relying on the council doing the ethical work, but the reviews are not made public to individuals outside of the council, making it unclear what ethical lines Unity will or won't draw. This, combined with a lack of transparency and understanding about how Unity technology is used by the military, is what's lead a number of Unity employees to demand more answers from the company.
- The person who makes the final call on projects, including those with the military, according to the document Unity employees used to collect answers from managers to ethical questions, is Riccitiello, and that "the assumption is that he will act upon the [council] recommendation." But the council recommendation is not required, which underscores the existing criticism of the arrangement: that the council lacks real teeth.
- In a statement to Waypoint, Unity said that SEAC recommendations have resulted in the company rejecting "deals that do not align with the principles [of Unity]."
- In April of this year, an internal AMA (ask me anything) session was held on Zoom among the company's AI group, which allowed a broader selection of employees to ask questions about projects the company was taking on and how it intersected with its stated AI responsibility principles and the role of the SEAC council in the company.
- "It was not quite the disaster that I thought it was going to be," said one source who attended, "but it was great in that a lot of people had questions and they [Unity] had very few answers."
- "I came to Unity explicitly because I naively believed their marketing around 'empowering creators' and 'making the world a better place' or whatever," said one source. "I got into AI with the expectation that I'd be building technology 'for the greater good' or some nonsense like that. You learn pretty quick, though, that cozying up to warfare profiteers is the fastest way to make money pretty much universally in the tech industry."
- "Whether or not I'm working directly for the government team, I'm empowering the products they're selling," said another source. "Do you want to use your tools to catch bad guys? Maybe we shouldn't be in the business of defining who bad guys are."
- Riccitiello’s Slack message anticipating this article provoked an enormous response from Unity's more than 4,000 employees, most of whom do not participate in or around Unity's government work. One employee told Waypoint there are more than 100 responses to Riccitiello’s message, a discussion still ongoing, with hundreds more responding with emojis.
- "The reactions are mixed," said the same source. "The largest group is angry to be finding out we're working with the military at all. There's a group that is confused or upset, but is withholding full judgement until they read the article. There's a group repeating some version of the 'slippery slope' argument over and over, and then there's a small contingent of men (mostly executives and upper management) who think we should all just Support 'Our' Troops and anything short of actually dropping the bombs ourselves is totally fine."
- The response was enough to prompt a follow-up by Riccitiello, promising to open Unity's next town hall meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, to start with a discussion about the topic.
- "I would not want Unity to do anything that violates our principles," said Riccitiello. "This is super-important to me. I realize that each of us would have their own individual take on where to draw the line on what works and doesn’t."
- Riccitiello praised the company's internal watchdog council, SEAC, though underscored it functions in an advisory role—it does not accept or reject deals on Unity's behalf. He noted SEAC is "relatively new" and Unity doesn't "have well practiced and enforced policies."
- "Some of what we’re reading is 100% accurate," he said. "Some not. Some a perspective based on partial information. I don’t see Slack as a good place to deal with these issues."
- Riccitiello promised "full transparency" in Tuesday's town hall meeting.
- Unity's full response to this story is below:
- As we said in our S-1 filing when Unity went public, we grew out of the core belief that our real-time 3D (RT3D) tools have applications outside of gaming. Unity’s RT3D platform solves the toughest engineering and data challenges our customers can face in their respective industries. We know this because the use of Unity’s real-time 3D platform is implemented in just about every production or manufacturing lifecycle in almost all industries in operation today - including the U.S. government and military.
- The use of Unity and real-time 3D in the government and aerospace industry as well as the U.S. military is not new to Unity, or its stakeholders. We’ve provided simulation and training, AI and machine learning, synthetic environment rendering and more to these customers for some time. We’ve had a relationship with The Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) for over a decade and we have active contracts with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army, and defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.
- Confidentiality clauses for these engagements are very restrictive - similar to many of our partnership deals including some of the work we do with gaming companies and in verticals such as retail - so while we can’t share specific details, we can say that we have a thorough review process, and we have not nor will we support programs where we knowingly violate our principles or values.
- We’re proud of our relationships and we’ve always been upfront about our work, most of which involves the adoption of RT3D technologies to improve workflows in manufacturing, training/simulation and design visualization.
- Unity was founded with a strong belief that the world is a better place with more creators in it. We believe in the freedom of expression, and as the Unity engine is a tool, a tool that can be downloaded and used by most anyone, it’s impossible to truly police or censor all uses of it.
- Next, when we partner or are actively working with an organization or company - whether it’s the US military or frankly, any of our customers - we ask ourselves if the specific engagement violates one of our key principles: that it does not directly involve the loss of life, harm of the planet, or a person’s right to equity and inclusion. We don’t invest our time and energy with customers to undermine these principles.
- We are also a company committed to human rights and social justice and these principles underscore our Unity Social Impact work - - where we invest $ and time to engender a more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable society through the potential of real-time 3D. We strongly believe in and support these causes.
- Following a series of company-wide roundtables with hundreds of Unity employees a couple of years ago, Unity created the Sales Ethics Advisory Council (“SEAC”). The SEAC is made up of interested Unity employees from diverse backgrounds, geographies and parts of the company to help evaluate upcoming business opportunities that present potential risks or may be controversial and it remains active today. Based on the SEAC’s recommendation, we have declined deals that do not align with the principles outlined above.
- As a company that has grown to over 4.6k employees, we recognize that people have differing views about doing business with military organizations. Above all, we remain committed to our core values and recognize that dialogue about opinions and lived experiences are central to making Unity a strong company. Some Unity employees serve in militaries, or have family or friends currently serving, and we employ veterans who have completed their service. We continue to respect their service and sacrifice and commend them for acting selflessly in support of their countries and their values.
- This is all to say that our creators and employees play a critical role by advising management and we’ll continue to work with them as Unity grows and our technology evolves. We will always respect a different point of view and want to encourage a public discourse of how the application of real-time 3D can be used in the most thoughtful manner. Unity believes in supporting its creators and employees, regardless of industry or point of view, and ensuring we work together in positively shaping the world’s future.

- Some staff are unaware they are potentially developing military technology
- Several Unity employees have spoken out in a report about the company’s numerous military contracts.
- The report published by Vice yesterday (August 23) details how Unity employees are potentially working on military contracts without being told. Unity, which is one of the biggest game development platforms globally, works with the United States government on military contracts.
- According to internal Unity documents obtained by Vice, senior management is struggling to explain why employees are creating technologies that could be used in military scenarios. Worryingly, some staff may develop technologies that are directly used in combat without being aware. This implies that some staff may play an active role in developing tools that could cause harm to other humans.
- Unity internally attempted to downplay the contracts by changing how management and senior staff refer to them. In an internal memo titled ‘GovTech Projects – Communication Protocol,’ the company told staff to refer to the contracts as government and not military with internal and external stakeholders. The memo states: “We need to be sensitive to the various values & beliefs which people perceive our engagement with the Government, specifically DoD [Department of Defense].”
- The memo also details how Unity’s work with the Department Of Defense is focused on how AI can improve training and simulations. It adds that none of the technology developed by staff will “be used in live warfighting.” Unity also mentions that its work with the DoD is dictated by its own ethical principles, which the department outlined in a press release last year.
- Valheim is developed in Unity Credit: Iron Gate Studio
- Staff have internally criticised the lack of transparency. One member of staff who spoke to Vice said it wasn’t always clear what staff were working on: “Most Unity AI work empowers other government projects, so in this way it can be difficult to gauge one’s contribution to government projects.”
- Another staff member anonymously said Unity should be clearer in what the contracts are for: “It should be very clear when people are stepping into the military initiative part of Unity.” One member of staff commented on how the team members shouldn’t need philosophy degrees to work at Unity: “Many of my fellow employees are very talented engineers or artists, but I don’t think that experience necessarily prepares us to be successful in passively identifying the complex repercussions of advancing certain emerging technologies.”
- AI and machine learning is a growing element of military defence efforts across the world. The US was criticised last year after a panel of United Nations experts concluded that the country had used an AI-controlled drone to ‘hunt down and remotely engage’ soldiers fighting for Libyan general Khalifa Haftar. This led to a global debate at the United Nations about using AI drones and potential restrictions. While Unity has explicitly stated that none of the technology it develops will be used in “live warfighting”, staff still might feel uneasy when seeing how the U.S. military intends to use AI.
- Unity responded to Vice’s report with a statement that one of its goals is to “have applications outside of gaming” and that its contract with the U.S. Military “is not new”. Unity also stated that the work it does with the Department Of Defense does not “knowingly violate our principles or values”, one of which is that work done “does not directly involve the loss of life, harm of the planet, or a person’s right to equity and inclusion.”

- You probably know Unity as a popular game engine, but Unity Technologies, the company behind the tool, doesn’t just make money from aspiring and established game developers. It also contracts work with various entities outside of gaming, including the government and, crucially, the Department of Defense. According to a lengthy Vice report published today, some employees aren’t looped into the full scope of that work. Some aren’t even made aware that their own efforts go toward those contracts.
- Imagine thinking that you’re just helping video games get made, only to discover that your labor is also getting funneled into war.
- If you’ve played video games, you’ve probably come across Unity at some point, seeing as its primary product has been used to create everything from Cities: Skylines to Fall Guys to Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator. The company, which was founded in 2005, went public on the New York Stock Exchange last year, and is currently valued at $33 billion. Earlier this month, Unity purchased Parsec, the game-streaming platform, for $320 million.
- Speaking to three former and current Unity employees, all of whom were granted anonymity for fear of reprisal, Vice learned that much of the company’s contracting is to do with artificial intelligence (AI) programming. Much of this is officially conducted under Unity’s “GovTech” department, but since some of the company’s work crosses departments, that means some employees could work on technology that helps further military initiatives without even knowing they’re doing it.
- Vice tracked down several deals inked with the Department of Defense, including two six-figure contracts for “modeling and simulation prototypes” with the U.S. Air Force. Reportedly, at a Unity all-hands meeting earlier this year, the company could only name one GovTech contract that wasn’t with the Department of Defense.
- “It should be very clear when people are stepping into the military initiative part of Unity,” one of Vice’s anonymous sources said, echoing an apparent sentiment from across the company.
- CEO John Riccitiello (yes, the same guy who used to head up EA...twice) responded to employees via Unity’s internal Slack, and promised an all-hands meeting with employees tomorrow.
- “Whether or not I’m working directly for the government team, I’m empowering the products they’re selling. Do you want to use your tools to catch bad guys? Maybe we shouldn’t be in the business of defining who bad guys are,” one source told Vice, whose report you can read right here.

- Investigation alleges that some developers are unaware that their work will become a part of defense contracts
- A new report says that Unity's lack of transparency with its military contracts has become a concern from some of its developers.
- According to documents obtained by Vice Games, the company is having difficulties as its developers discover their work is, or may be, part of military projects.
- Unity's work with the government isn't new, as the company was certified by the U.S Army and Air Force in 2011. Working with the military is also featured on its website.
- But three current and former Unity employees claim that some people are unaware that their work becomes technology for the Department of Defense.
- "Most Unity AI work empowers other government projects, so in this way it can be difficult to gauge one's contribution to government projects," said one source.
- Developers are also unsure whether the tools they create could then be used by another part of the company for military contracts.
- In response to the investigation, Unity CEO John Riccitiello released a statement that read in part, "...we can say that we have a thorough review process, and we have not nor will we support programs where we knowingly violate our principles or values."
- In response to his message, sources said that most employees are angry that the company is working with the military.
- In a statement sent to Vice Games, Unity said: "We believe in the freedom of expression, and as the Unity engine is a tool, a tool that can be downloaded and used by most anyone, it's impossible to truly police or censor all uses of it."
- Riccitello is said to have promised full transparency to employees.
- Unity is not the only company in the games industry to face such concerns. Microsoft staff called on their employer to cancel a $480 million contract to build HoloLens headsets for the US Army.

- If you’re into gaming, chances are you might have heard of Unity. The popular game-making tool, and the name behind popular labels like Hollow Knight and Hearthstone, has for years been expanding into different sectors, and venturing into many different industries. From films and automotive, to engineering, transportation, and architecture, you name it, Unity has done it. But this versatility is now making the employees question Unity’s ethics, at a time when the firm seeks to venture into war.
- This comes even as the company takes pride in mentioning that it has dealings with governments and militaries. Internal documents have been obtained by Waypoint, which show that Unity is finding it hard to keep its employees on board its plans. Staff members are apparently miffed that even though their contracts stated that they would be helping game makers, they are now inadvertently being forced to develop technologies for militaries, so as to empower them for wars.
- Some sources that Waypoint has contacted claim that the technologies being developed by some Unity staff might end up in the hands of the military, without them even being aware of the same. The section of the company that deals with developing tools for the military and governments has been nicknamed “GovTech,” and is invested in developing tools that would help the “government adapt AI and ML (machine learning).”
- One internal memo by the company showcases how Unity knows that it ought to inform employees about what they may be accomplices in. The memo, which is titled, “GovTech Projects-Communication Protocol,” highlights the fact that Unity should come clean about such contracts to its “internal/external stakeholders.”
- The memo further reads that it ought to be “sensitive” about the many different faiths and beliefs that people may harbour, while perceiving its “engagement with the Government, specifically DoD (Department of Defense).” Managers have apparently been directed to refer to such contracts as being with the “government” or “defense,” as opposed to the term “military.”
- The memo, which is not dated, also directs employees to know that the company’s contracts with the government/defense are such as to provide solutions to the recipients, and nothing else.
- 
- But this apparently isn’t enough to assuage staff’s concerns, especially since they do not have direct access to every deal forged and every move taken by Unity. And so, at least a part of the problem emerges from the fact that most employees don’t even know what the projects are about. So, staff are demanding to know what exactly they are working on,

- When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
- Some employees have expressed ethical concerns over the possibility that their game-related work could end up in military applications.
- Unity is a multiplatform game engine that's been around for nearly 20 years now. It's popular with game developers because it's very capable—recent Unity-based games include Outer Wilds, Cloudpunk, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, and Phasmophobia—and also because, with some limitations, it can be had for free. It isn't solely used for games, though. According to a recent Vice report, some Unity employees are unhappy with the company's partnerships with the US military.
- The Department of Defense dealings aren't a secret, but they're not the sort of thing the company broadcasts loudly, either. Two references to US Air Force programs, for instance, are found on Unity's "Government and Aerospace" page, alongside a "virtual simulations and modeling" partnership with Lockheed Martin, one of the largest defense contractors in the world—not exactly the most prominent location possible.
- Lockheed Martin, for instance, "leverages Unity to reduce physical prototyping and testing, saving millions of dollars by discovering and resolving issues much earlier in development," while a company called Dynepic, which develops training platforms for clients including the US Air Force (the company's website features an image of someone in a USAF uniform engaged in what is presumably VR training) extolled Unity's capabilities in a Military Training and Simulation report.
- "Everyone knows Unity is a great tool for creating content, but with our Unity SDK developers can quickly integrate training with MOTAR’s LMS [Learning Management System], allowing the Air Force to view consolidated student performance data," Arthur Goikhman of Dynepic explained.
- The company also appeared eager to talk down that aspect of its business in an undated internal memo obtained by Vice that offered specific pointers for Unity employees talking about its government work. Managers are told to use the terms "government" or "defense" instead of "military"—and noted that "nothing we are doing will be used in live warfighting."
- You learn pretty quick, though, that cozying up to warfare profiteers is the fastest way to make money pretty much universally in the tech industry.
- Despite that, three anonymous sources, all current and former Unity employees, told Vice that ethical concerns arise from the potential crossover between military and non-military projects. Artificial intelligence development for videogame purposes, for instance, may also end up in military-related projects, without developers being aware that it happened.
- "I came to Unity explicitly because I naively believed their marketing around 'empowering creators' and 'making the world a better place' or whatever," one source said. "I got into AI with the expectation that I'd be building technology 'for the greater good' or some nonsense like that. You learn pretty quick, though, that cozying up to warfare profiteers is the fastest way to make money pretty much universally in the tech industry."
- Another source said that employees are "empowering" the products Unity's government team is selling, even if they're not working on them directly.
- After being contacted by Vice for comment, Unity CEO John Riccitiello released an internal statement reassuring employees that the company's military contracts "are very restrictive," and that "we have not nor will we support programs where we knowingly violate our principles or values." In a separate statement, the company also said that it has an internal Sales Ethics Advisory council, which is a group of employees "from diverse backgrounds, geographies and parts of the company [who] help evaluate upcoming business opportunities that present potential risks or may be controversial." According to Unity, it has declined partnerships that don't align with its principles on the recommendation of that council.
- But Riccitiello's internal memo sparked a backlash, according to another source, who said that a large number of employees are only just becoming aware of Unity's military partnerships now, and while a few, "mostly executives and upper management," have a strong "support the troops" attitude, most aren't very happy about it. As a result, Riccitiello promised in a follow-up memo that the matter would be discussed in the company's next town hall meeting, scheduled for next week.
- Unity isn't alone as a game technology company that works with the US military: Epic actively promotes the use of its Unreal Engine technology in various military and police programs, and Microsoft recently signed a $22 billion deal to supply the US Army with an Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) based on its HoloLens headset. An earlier contract to supply the Army with IVAS prototypes, worth $479 million in 2019, sparked similar pushback from Microsoft employees, who said in an open letter that they "did not sign up to develop weapons."

- A new report reveals how Unity is working with the US government on military research, which has some employees worried.
- Most people know Unity as the game engine powering such titles as Hollow Knight, Cuphead, and Fall Guys. Not many people know that Unity also works with governments on military defense contracts, and that has some employees worried that their work is being used for unethical purposes.
- A new report from Waypoint looks into the company's secretive military business, which according to internal documents, Unity called "GovTech." The same documents also provide Unity staff with "do's and don'ts" for describing GovTech to employees, such as calling them "government" or "defense" contracts and not "military" contracts.
- Besides obfuscating Unity’s role with language, it’s hard for Unity employees to know exactly what their work is being used for, especially when it comes to AI and machine learning. Most of the work done on either subject is used throughout the company, whether that means for game development or for military applications, and Unity doesn’t tell the employee necessarily where their work is going once it’s done.

- In one case, Waypoint found out that one Unity employee was told that they were making "a placement randomization scheme for a government simulation project." It turned out that they were actually making simulated "explosion debris on virtual runways" for the US military.
- Another technology Unity is working on is RIDE, or Rapid Integration & Development Environment. This simulation platform is being developed by the University of Southern California directly supporting defense research and is sponsored by the US Army Research lab. A video advertising RIDE shows soldiers, tanks, and jeeps, all in a virtual training environment for US soldiers.
- When asked for comment, Unity refused to answer questions about how much it makes from military contracts or what those projects entailed, but they did say they've signed contracts with the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.
- Unity's response also noted "key principles" for its work, such as that no Unity project can "directly involve the loss of life, harm of the planet, or a person’s right to equity and inclusion."
