- Three robots have collided at an Ocado warehouse in Erith, south-east London, leading to a fire, the facility's evacuation and the cancellation of thousands of customer orders. The warehouse is serviced by around 3,500 delivery-packing robots.
- According to the London Fire Brigade, fifteen fire engines and around 100 firefighters were called to extinguish the fire. Ocado put the cost of the fire at GBP 35 million.
- The collision is not the first incident involving robots at an Ocado facility. In July 2019, an Ocado robot malfunctioned in its Andover warehouse that resulted in a major fire.
- The Andover warehouse had to re-built at an estimated cost of GBP 110 million.

- Online supermarket Ocado has cancelled some customer orders and warned of ongoing disruption after a fire caused by a collision between robots closed its largest distribution warehouse.
- The blaze on Friday afternoon at the Thamesside facility in Erith, south east London, happened when three robotic vehicles used in the company’s state-of-the-art grocery picking system collided, causing a “deep-seated” fire tackled by some 100 firefighters as the giant building was evacuated. No-one was injured.
- The #Erith warehouse fire is under control. The fire has damaged a small amount of the loading bays. The fire was very deep seated and it was a challenging operation. Firefighters will remain at the scene throughout the day damping down hot spots https://t.co/Epv5hmnykK pic.twitter.com/FkWX23uw5J
- Ocado insisted that the fire had affected less than one per cent of the “grid” used by its automated vehicles and said it expected operations at the site to begin again within a week. But the blaze had an immediate knock-on effect, with customers being warned to expect deliveries to be cancelled and Ocado’s website refusing to take any bookings beyond the next week.
- Customers took to Twitter to express their bemusement with orders being cancelled as far away as Hampshire and others saying they had switched to a different retailer to avoid missing their delivery. One customer complained that his order on Saturday had been cancelled yet Ocado deliveries were made to two of his neighbours.
- The online supermarket, which has become a hit with investors after benefiting hugely from the shift to online shopping during the pandemic and increasing its customers by more than a fifth during the first half of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, apologised for the upheaval.
- In a statement, the company said that apart from a residual smell of smoke, the warehouse was largely undamaged. It  added: “While we expect some disruption to operations, we are working to restore normal service as soon as possible. We expect the facility to begin operating within the coming week and thank customers whose orders are affected for their patience.”
- The fire is the second significant blaze caused by an incident linked to its grocery-carrying robots to affect the retailer. In February 2019, a new warehouse in Andover, Hampshire, was destroyed in a fire that burned for four days and cost Ocado some £110m.
- A subsequent investigation into the fire found that it had been caused by an electrical fault in a battery charging unit which resulted in a plastic lid on one of the automated vehicles catching light. A report found that the blaze was able to spread because a detection system failed and staff turned off sprinklers for a brief period before realising the fire was taking hold and calling 999.
- Ocado said the Erith fire had been successfully contained by deploying all suitable measures. Some 15 fire engines were called to the warehouse with firefighters remaining in place until the early hours of Saturday to ensure any hot spots had been dampened down.
- When asked about the number of customers affected by cancellations or when it was likely to re-open orders for the coming weeks, the supermarket said it had nothing to add to its existing statement.
- The company last year recorded a 35 per cent leap in revenues to £2.2bn, with underlying profits of £73m. In its most recent earnings statement earlier this month it said it was continuing to run at a net loss as it invests heavily to meet booming demand. The company has scored a significant success by selling its hi-tech warehouse system abroad to other retailers.

- The supermarket giant Ocado has warned customers to expect delays after a fire broke out at its warehouse near the Thames, the second big blaze to have been started by its fleet of robots.
- The company said the fire “appears to have been caused by the collision of three bots on the grid”. The robots, similar to small fridges on wheels, move at 9mph around the grid, which resembles a giant chess board, to pick and transport groceries.
- About 100 firefighters needed 14 hours to extinguish the “deep-seated” blaze in “hot and arduous” conditions at the three-storey warehouse in Erith, southeast London. The fire forced Ocado to cancel some orders and supply others from alternative sites. It said the fire had affected “less than 1

- Online retailer's biggest grocery packing facility is offline following a blaze caused by three robots colliding
- Ocado customers face a week of disruption to orders following a fire at the online grocer’s biggest warehouse.
- The blaze broke out late on Friday after three robots used to handle orders collided at the Erith facility in southeast London, the FTSE 100 company said.
- It can handle about 150,000 orders a week under its joint venture with Marks & Spencer.
- “While we expect some disruption to operations, we are working to restore normal service as soon as possible,” Ocado said.
- It predicted that operations would resume at Erith “within the coming week” and thanked customers for their patience.
- Damage affected less than 1pc of the robot grid and was contained by fire prevention measures.
- The blaze required about 100 firefighters and 15 fire engines to tackle. “​​The fire was deep seated and was a challenging operation,” the London Fire Brigade said.
- More than 800 workers were evacuated from the facility but none were injured.
- We're really sorry. Due to a major incident at our Erith warehouse some of our orders have been cancelled. Please be patient with us while we manage this. If this impacts your order, we will be in touch. Thank you.
- The incident is the second major fire to hit an Ocado warehouse in the past three years following a blaze at its Andover, Hampshire facility in February 2019 that took more than 24 hours to bring under control.
- Another fire occurred at Erith laster that year when an industrial skip caught alight.
- Earlier this month the M&S chairman, Archie Norman, said Ocado was still struggling to meet demand from customers almost a year after it switched from Waitrose to M&S products.
- He told the company’s annual meeting that although M&S was pleased about “where we are, I’m not saying there aren’t issues”.
- “Working in a joint venture, you have to put a bit more work into it to make sure you’re aligned,” Mr Norman added.
- “We have to position our [food] business right for [online], and make sure that Ocado has the right growth in place. It doesn’t cover a lot of the country, there is a lot of investment due to it.”
- 
- Social media was filled with unhappy Ocado customers over the weekend complaining that they were unable to receive their weekly shop following a fire Ocado’s largest warehouse in the UK in Erith on Friday night, forcing it to cancel orders.
- “One fire at a depot is unfortunate. But two? Makes one wonder if the automation model is fatally flawed,” tweeted one unhappy customer. “Combined with sharp rise in substitutions and out of stocks since [the] switch to M&S, if this now means weeks of disruption then I fear my 16-year subscription is at serious risk.”

- Being forced to cancel thousands of orders due to another warehouse fire is bad enough for Ocado, but more seriously it risks overshadowing the company’s attempts to sell its robotics technology to retailers around the world.
- Investors will be looking for reassurance today that the incident, caused by three robots colliding, does not risk overshadowing Ocado’s wider business.
- “In the last four years, how many fires have Ocado’s competitors had in their warehouses?” asked one contributor to an online investment forum on Sunday.
- Ocado is likely to point to sheer bad luck as a cause of the incident, but shareholders will not be pleased that Ocado is once more in the news for the wrong reasons, with images of fire engines rushing to one of its facilities.
- The Erith warehouse was first ablaze in August 2019, when a skip outside the main building caught alight. Months earlier, the company suffered a far more serious blaze at another of its key robotics hubs in Andover.
- The Hampshire fire sent Ocado shares tumbling 12pc as shareholders learned that the building’s roof had collapsed, shutting down its robotics grid system in the building. That fire cost Ocado £110m, pushing the company to a £142m half-year loss.
- Another fire two years later risks upending Ocado’s carefully maintained image as a British retail and technology success story.
- Ocado’s hope is that its British grocery delivery partnership with Marks & Spencer will become a small part of far larger revenues to be generated by licensing its robotic technology to retailers around the world.
- Last year it officially opened the doors on the first international Ocado warehouses for Groupe Casino in France and Sobey’s in Canada. In 2021, the company plans to expand that to 10 warehouses worldwide using its boxy robots.
- US supermarket Kroger has announced plans for 10 Ocado robotic warehouses in America, with the option to build 10 more.
- Maintaining the revenue from continued global interest in Ocado’s technology, the guinea pig of which has been its UK operations, relies on a mixture of secrecy and showmanship.
- Even back in 2016, Ocado’s robotics technology was a closely guarded secret. Executives forbid any journalists visiting the company’s warehouses from taking any photographs of the elaborate system of ramps that transport plastic bins full of groceries around the building.
- Their fear, justified or not, was that supermarkets such as Tesco would pore over any images that emerged in the hope of replicating Ocado’s technology.
- Back then, its Hatfield warehouse complex appeared rudimentary. Senior employees would use their arms to hold back bins full of groceries, causing a pile-up of vegetables and ready meals as visitors clambered over moving belts.
- Ocado’s robots now entrance observers and slick marketing videos show them travelling at speeds of up to four metres per second around a grid the size of several football fields.
- The robots collect plastic bins of items underneath them, taking them to “picking” stations for humans or other robots to sort into customer orders.
- Tim Steiner, Ocado’s chief executive, hasn’t been shy about extolling the virtues of its technology.
- Kroger’s partnership with Ocado “will transform the American grocer into the number one player in e-commerce in the US”, he has said, predicting that it could even overtake Amazon.
- With Kroger’s 2020 revenues sitting at $122bn compared to Amazon’s $386bn, the company still has far some way to go.
- Friday’s fire – Ocado’s second blaze inside a robotic warehouse – risks dissuading international retailers from spending millions on licensing the technology, as well as a further £7m annual bill per facility.
- However, retail analyst Richard Hyman dismisses the headlines following the latest fire and does not believe it will cause lasting damage to the company.
- “These fires have been bad luck,” he says. “Most of Ocado's business is in selling its IP. I personally don't think that having a couple of fires really is going to make any material impact on that. If they keep having them then that is an issue for the business as a whole.”
- Bad luck though they may have been, it’s now down to Ocado to reassure investors that the two warehouse fires were accidents rather than some type of fault with the robots.
- The company has played down the damage and says damage affected a small section of less than 1pc of the grid. “While we expect some disruption to operations, we are working to restore normal service as soon as possible. We expect the facility to begin operating within the coming week.”
- In 2019, analysts were quick to move on from fears of a wider problem caused by the Andover fire. “While the retail business will be materially impacted, we see no reason yet to consider this a major setback for the Ocado technology business,” said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne at the time.
- It remains to be seen whether risk-averse supermarkets and online retailers will take fright after a second fire inside one an Ocado warehouse. Some may decide that Amazon’s reliance on humans, albeit augmented with clever software that shows them where to go inside its warehouses, is a safer option.

- The total cost of a large fire at Ocado's Erith warehouse earlier this year has been revealed to be £35 million after around 300,000 customer orders were cancelled.
- The online grocer reported that the blaze, which was caused by its robots colliding, would hit its full-year profits by £10 million.
- It took almost 12 hours for around 100 firefighters to bring a 'deep seated' fire under control at the major warehouse in Erith's Church Manorway on July 16 earlier this year.
- Around 800 staff were evacuated from the south east London warehouse as firefighters worked in "hot and arduous conditions" inside, but no injuries were reported.
- A spokesperson for Ocado said at the time that the fire was cause by “three bots on the grid” colliding as it apologised after being forced to cancel deliveries and block new orders.
- The company downplayed the impact of the fire, saying that the correct protocols were successfully implemented and less than one percent of the grid was damaged.
- The Ocado warehouse in south east London
- But Ocado has now admitted that they lost around 300,000 orders as a result of the disruption, dragging their sales down by 19% over the seven-week period covering the fire.
- Bosses also revealed they will face a further £10 million hit this year due to a fire at the company's warehouse in Erith, south-east London, in the summer which led to around 300,000 customer orders worth £35 million being cancelled.
- Sales fell 10.6% to £517.5 million in the 13 weeks to August 29, in part due to the fire but also because of strong comparisons last year at the height of the pandemic.
- The company said the period should be looked at in two distinct halves and that sales were only down 1.8% in the first six weeks - before the fire. The following seven weeks saw sales down 19%.
- It was the third fire to hit an Ocado warehouse in three years, with its site in Andover, Hampshire, only recently returning to full operation two years after a blaze.
- Despite the falls, Ocado said it signed up 64,000 new customers during the period, with 805,000 in total, and orders per week rose 22%.
- However, the average basket size was down 12% to £124 compared with £141 a year ago.
- Ocado have also announced they are to spend up to £5 million extra this year in pay rises, recruitment and signing-on bonuses for HGV drivers.
- The online grocer said the shortage, caused by Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic, has become "an increasingly important issue for the industry" and that it will try to mitigate costs where possible.
- Bosses are confident the company can continue its strong growth, announcing that capacity at its warehouses in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and Dordon, Warwickshire, have increased, allowing 600,000 orders a week to be completed.
- They also announced plans to open two new warehouses in Luton and Bicester, which will allow the company to increase capacity to 700,000 orders per week.
- Tim Steiner, chairman of Ocado Retail, said: "Despite the challenges we faced in the period, I am delighted to report that Ocado Retail is performing well, improving the customer experience even further and continuing to grow the business in a post-lockdown environment."
