- Over 300 residents of Atlantic Plaza Towers in Brooklyn, New York, have successfully fought off a proposal by their landlord to install a facial recognition system behind their backs.
- The StoneLock facial recognition system was to be used so that recognised tenants could open the front door to their buildings rather than using traditional keys or electronic key fobs.
- However, residents felt it was an 'extreme' intrusion on their privacy, and that they did not want their movements to be tracked. They were also concerned that the landlord wanted to attract higher-income, white tenants to the majority-black public building.
- In July 2018, the landlord Nelson Management Group had sought state approval to install the system under a state rule which says that landlords of rent-regulated apartments built before 1974 must seek permission from the state’s Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) agency for any 'modification in service.'
- Brooklyn Legal Services worked with tenants to issue (pdf) a letter of protest that noted that most tenants at Atlantic Plaza Towers were black and that studies had shown that facial recognition disproportionately impacts people of colour.
- Nelson announced it was withdrawing the plan in November 2019.

- Imagine being locked out of your home because software selected by your landlord can’t identify your face.
- Lawmakers want to press pause on deploying facial recognition and other biometric technology in public housing. Though it’s not clear the extent to which the technology is already being used in public housing (or other categories of government-supported and -regulated housing), lawmakers say facial recognition raises privacy concerns, and point to its known inaccuracies, especially when applied to people of color and women (among other minority groups).
- There’s no law regulating facial recognition at the federal level yet. But complementary legislation introduced in the House and the Senate — the “No Biometric Barriers to Housing Act” — would put a hold on the use of biometric-based recognition systems in most housing supported by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The bill also directs the department to conduct research into the technology and its potential impact on residents of public housing.
- HUD says on its website that about 1.2 million people live in public housing units, which are run by more than 3,000 housing agencies.
- “[W]hen public housing and federally assisted property owners install facial recognition security camera systems, they could be used to enable invasive, unnecessary, and harmful government surveillance of their residents,” wrote eight members of Congress, including Sens. Cory Booker and Ron Wyden and Reps. Yvette Clarke and Rashida Tlaib, in a letter to HUD Secretary Ben Carson last week. “Those who cannot afford more do not deserve less in basic privacy and protections.”
- Among other questions, lawmakers want to know how many federally assisted public housing properties have already used facial recognition.
- “The goal of what this bill does is getting ahead of [facial recognition] before it becomes an issue,” said Sarah Sinovic, a spokesperson for Rep. Clarke, who first proposed the House legislation alongside Reps. Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley in July. “We don’t want to get into a situation where individuals are subjected to this and there hasn’t been anything to pump the brakes.”
- An online petition in support of the bill has already attracted at least 44,000 signatures, though the legislation does have at least one critic: the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. The think tank said in an online statement that “[r]ather than lock out low-income Americans from the latest innovations, Congress should welcome the availability of technology that prevents them from getting locked out of their homes.”
- It’s not clear how widespread the technology actually is. In Detroit, surveillance cameras installed in public housing could be used in conjunction with facial recognition technology, according to the New York Times. In New York City, facial recognition has also been used for years at a Lower East Side affordable housing complex called Knickerbocker Village, as reported by the Gothamist, that’s overseen by New York State’s Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR).
- In a statement to Recode, a HUD spokesperson said that no housing authorities have asked to fund facial recognition software through its emergency safety and security fund (that’s the same thing HUD told the New York Times in September). The spokesperson did not clarify whether this fund was the only way in which HUD could become aware of facial recognition used in federally assisted housing.
- Barbara Brancaccio, a spokesperson for the New York City Housing Authority, which oversees low- and moderate-income housing, says facial recognition is not used at any of its developments.
- The proposed federal legislation was inspired by the organizing efforts of New York residents of Atlantic Plaza Towers, a rent-stabilized building complex in Brownsville, Brooklyn.
- Residents there successfully pushed their landlord, Nelson Management, to withdraw plans for a facial recognition system. The proposed federal bill technically wouldn’t apply to those residents (the buildings are not HUD-assisted housing), but their objections highlight much of what has lawmakers worried. For one thing, the residents of Atlantic Plaza Towers only became aware of the introduction of the technology through a “modification of services” application document that must be sent to tenants. In the case of Atlantic Plaza Towers, that notice is only required because facial recognition was not initially used by the building complex.
- (Brooklyn Legal Services, which assisted the Atlantic Plaza Towers tenants, has said that only some of the residents got the notice, adding to concerns about basic transparency with residents.)
- The document sent to residents (which you can view at the bottom of this article) argues that traditional key fobs allow people who are not authorized to enter the building, and that key fobs can also be copied. “Facial recognition cannot be duplicated whereas a key fob can be,” says the note, explaining that the building owner planned to use facial recognition technology provided by a Kansas-based security company called StoneLock. (AI Now, a research nonprofit, wrote a letter to DHCR explaining that the StoneLock offers a somewhat unique biometric system since it identifies faces through heat-mapping).
- Tranae Moran, a community organizer at Atlantic Plaza Towers and privacy advocate, says she was already uncomfortable with the use of facial recognition on social media platforms, and found the idea that the technology would be used to regulate entry into her building “immediately alarming.” She said that no significant effort was made to explain the technology to residents.
- Residents also had other concerns. The technology is known to be especially inaccurate when applied to women and people of color (who constitute a large majority of Atlantic Plaza Towers residents). Those findings were confirmed by a National Institute of Standards and Technology study released last week.
- Moran said she was also worried about children being scanned into the system, and added that the community at Atlantic Plaza Towers already feels surveilled, noting that the system was proposed amid increasing gentrification in her neighborhood.
- “You’re basically locked out of having agency over your own biometrics, which is worse than being locked out of your credit card or your debit card or having an account frozen because of some funny activity,” said Fabian Rogers, a floor captain and community advocate at the Atlantic Plaza Towers Tenant Association.
- He expressed concern that residents wouldn’t have control over the data collected by these systems, that the technology could be used to enforce evictions, and that the police could potentially gain access to the system and its data.
- “Affordable housing populations are being heavily taken advantage of because of the fact that their circumstances hinder them from being part of the fight for better, essentially. And landlords are running amuck because there aren’t proper policies to protect tenants in the first place,” he said.
- “Imagine coming home from work at the end of the day — you might work one, two, maybe three jobs — you’re trying to get into your home. And you can’t get through your front door, you can’t get past the lobby because the screening [or] the scan of your face doesn’t recognize you as you,” added Sinovic. “Just because someone happens to be lower-income and in public housing doesn’t mean that they should be the ones that are the guinea pigs that are used for this software.”
- After significant tenant organizing, the residents managed to put a hold on the plans, and the landlord withdrew the application. “I appreciate feedback from residents and stakeholders throughout this process, and look forward to continued progress on upgrades at Atlantic Plaza Towers,” said Nelson Management president Robert Nelson in a statement to Recode.
- “[Nelson Management] could still put in an application literally months away from now and we still have no proper protection,” cautions Rogers. Nelson Management did not clarify to Recode whether it would potentially move to install a facial recognition system in the future.
- A proposed bill in New York City would guarantee tenants the right to a physical key, and says that landlords can’t force tenants to use various security technologies to enter their homes, including “facial recognition” and “biometric scanning.” Legislation has also been proposed in the New York State Senate and Assembly that would ban the use of facial recognition in residential buildings.
- “Technology that discriminates against tenants of color, denies residents access to their own homes, and robs tenants of their privacy rights and control over their own biometric data does not belong in residential spaces, no matter how the building is zoned,” said Samar Katnani, an attorney at Brooklyn Legal Services, in an email. Brooklyn Legal Services says it’s aware of at least four other New York City buildings with facial recognition, and a fifth that is moving to install the technology.
- But none of that legislation has been enacted yet. Since the case of Atlantic Plaza Towers’ proposal, DHCR has received one application for the use of facial recognition technology in a rent-regulated building in Corona, Queens, whose owner wants to install a “virtual doorman” that will provide several methods for entering the building, including facial recognition and a traditional key.
- “[The Office of Rent Administration] will not issue an order until it has carefully reviewed both the owner’s and tenants’ submissions,” said Sochet Charni, a spokesperson for DHCR, in an emailed statement to Recode.
- Meanwhile, Moran is calling for more collaboration among lawmakers, organizers, and technology experts.
- “Terms change every few years in technology. By the time something goes into effect for ‘facial recognition,’ we’re going to be dealing with something new under a new name and new term,” said Moran of the laws that have been proposed. “The walls between agencies and between industries are way too high. They need to open some windows and talk to each other.”

- In the latest episode of the podcast Crazy/Genius, we speak with residents of East New York—and hear some frightening parallels.
- Subscribe to Crazy/Genius: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google Play
- Updated at 1:23 p.m. ET on May 30, 2019.
- The Chinese government is brutalizing its Muslim Uyghur population in the western province of Xinjiang, in what Omer Kanat, the director of the Uyghur Human Rights Watch, calls a “genocide without the gas chambers.” Up to 2 million Uyghurs are reportedly being held in detention centers, where they have allegedly been separated from their families and in many cases tortured.
- This horrifying situation is built on the scaffolding of mass surveillance. Cameras fill the marketplaces and intersections of the key city of Kashgar. Recording devices are placed in homes and even in bathrooms. Checkpoints that limit the movement of Muslims are often outfitted with facial-recognition devices to vacuum up the population’s biometric data. As China seeks to export its suite of surveillance tech around the world, Xinjiang is a kind of R&D incubator, with the local Muslim population serving as guinea pigs in a laboratory for the deprivation of human rights.
- Nothing in the United States compares. But the use of novel surveillance tools to monitor, terrify, and even oppress minority citizens is not a foreign concept.
- The latest episode of Crazy/Genius, produced by Jesse Brenneman and Patricia Yacob, tells the tale of two surveillance states. The first is Xinjiang, China. The second is Brooklyn, New York. (Subscribe here.)
- This spring, I spoke with residents of Atlantic Plaza Towers, a rent-stabilized apartment complex in East Brooklyn. They have dealt with the omnipresence of security cameras in and around their home. “Once I walk out of my house, on the elevator, in the lobby, in between the buildings, in the supermarket, in the parking lot. I can go nowhere and not be watched,” said Tranae Moran, a young mother. “It’s almost like a panopticon complex, where they have every nook and cranny covered,” said Fabian Rogers, a 23-year-old resident.
- Last fall the landlord, Nelson Management, mailed residents a letter announcing plans to install a facial-recognition-technology system at the entrance of the buildings. The letter asked tenants for their permission, but that request seemed less than genuine, for several reasons. Many tenants never received the letter—one of the mailrooms was under reconstruction, disrupting delivery services. Worse, after some residents met in the lobby to discuss the landlord’s plan, they received a threatening letter from management warning them not to gather in public spaces again. (A lawyer told me the landlord’s request violated the law.) Attached to the letter was a photo taken from a corner camera in the lobby. In black-pen ink, each resident in the photograph had been identified by his or her apartment number. Residents said the message was clear: Get with the program, or get out.
- Most of the residents of Atlantic Plaza Towers are black. The tenants I met said the threat of installing facial-recognition technology felt designed to scare them away to clear out space for richer, white tenants. “I think [management] wants a new look for the building, and that look does not look brown or any color like us,” Moran said. “In China, they have facial-recognition technology that they’re using to target communities of Muslim people. Sounds very similar to Brooklyn and gentrification.”
- “You wouldn’t do this to anyone in SoHo, in the Upper East Side, or in other gentrified communities,” Rogers said. “So why do this to me? I’m not on parole. I’m not on house arrest. I don’t have a collar on my neck or my ankles. Don’t treat me like I’m an inmate.”
- Nelson Management did not respond to requests for comment before publication. In an email on Thursday, a spokesperson for the landlord sent a statement. “Nelson Management Group prioritizes identifying and implementing cutting edge technology at all properties to create a safer environment for tenants and to provide the highest-quality housing in the rent-stabilized market,” the statement said. “Since Nelson Management Group acquired Atlantic Plaza Towers in 2007, the resident turnover rate has been trending down to an average of 2.56% per annum.” Nelson Management denied “claims that management are pursuing these safety upgrades at buildings for data harvesting.”
- According to Mona Patel of Brooklyn Legal Services, the landlord may have another motive that’s just as sinister as displacement: data harvesting. “The tenants in these two buildings are being exploited for their data,” said Patel. “This is a new technology that hasn’t been, as far as we know, tested in a residential complex. We haven’t seen any validation studies proving it will accurately work for people of color. It almost feels like the tenants are the study.”
- Nelson Management is not the Chinese Communist Party. And Atlantic Towers is not Xinjiang. But in both places, minorities are being surveilled with nascent technology and subjected to an organized effort to control their behavior.
- Citizens should have the right to make informed choices about participating in a brave new world of biometric data. It’s comforting to pretend that the gravest threats from these technologies are only as close as a newspaper headline describing a distant world. But the project of protecting people from our own inventions is a project that begins at home.

- BROWNSVILLE, BROOKLYN — Brownsville tenants filed a legal objection against their landlord's request to install facial recognition technology in his rent-stabilized buildings, attorneys announced Wednesday.
- More than 130 Tenants of Atlantic Plaza Towers, a 700-apartment complex at Thomas S. Boyland and Atlantic avenues, hope to block landlord Robert Nelson's pending application to bring the controversial security system into the Brownsville development, according to the Brooklyn Legal Services' Tenants Rights Coalition.
- “The ability to enter your home should not be conditioned on the surrender of your biometric data,” said attorney Samar Katnani. “Particularly when the landlord’s collection, storage, and use of such data is untested and unregulated."
- Attorneys argue in the opposition document that the proposed security system from StoneLock, which generates biometric metadata for each tenant, would violate rent-stabilization laws which mandate landlords not interfere with tenants' privacy or offer renewal leases with added terms and conditions.
- They also raised concerns about biases embedded in facial recognition technology, which studies have shown attributes more negative emotions to black men's faces and is less able to identify women.
- “We don’t believe he’s doing this to beef up security in the building," said tenant Icemae Downes. "We believe he’s doing this to attract new tenants who don’t look like us.”
- Atlantic Towers Associates, L.P., did not alert tenants when it first filed an application with New York State Homes and Community Renewal office, which oversees rent-stabilized housing, in the summer of 2018, according to Gothamist.
- It is the first time the office has considered the legality of such security software, the tenants' attorneys said.
- "We are in uncharted waters with the use of facial recognition technology in residential spaces," Katnani said. "HCR does not have the jurisdiction or authority to adequately protect tenants."
- The Brooklyn Legal Services' Tenants Rights Coalition is calling on HCR to reject the application, which Katnani said "poses a serious threat to tenants’ privacy and well-being.”
- But Nelson Management Group argues the facial recognition technology would improve conditions at Atlantic Plaza Towers by making the tenants safer and promised collected data would be protected.
- "We have engaged a leading provider of security technology for proposed upgrades, which has assured ownership that data collected is never exposed to third parties and is fully encrypted," a spokesperson said.
- “The sole goal of implementing this technology is to advance that priority and support the safety and security of residents."
- The spokesperson added that Nelson Management will comply with whatever HCR recommended, and an HCR spokesperson confirmed the application is under review.

- A Brooklyn landlord whose efforts to install a facial recognition system spurred tenant protests and stoked fears over the increasing encroachment of biometric technology in residential dwellings has announced that he is no longer pursuing the plan.
- On Tuesday, Robert Nelson, the president of Nelson Management Group, delivered the news himself to tenants of Atlantic Plaza Towers, a rent-stabilized 700-unit development his company owns in Brownsville, during a town hall. The meeting was intended to be a conversation between tenants and representatives from elected officials who have introduced legislation to regulate facial recognition and similar technologies.
- No one expected Nelson to attend, much less say that he would reverse course.
- "Most tenants have never seen Nelson before," said Tranae Moran, one of the residents at the meeting. "It was a huge shock to a lot of tenants, myself included."
- The following day, Nelson issued a formal statement saying that the company had decided to withdraw its application with the state to put in facial recognition at Atlantic Plaza Towers. By law, Nelson had been required to seek permission from the state’s Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) agency, which oversees rent-regulated properties, because facial recognition constitutes a change in service. "I appreciate feedback from residents and stakeholders throughout this process, and look forward to continued progress on upgrades at Atlantic Plaza Towers," Nelson said in the statement.
- Another tenant, Fabian Rogers, called the announcement a "great half step."
- Referring to pending legislation, the most far-reaching of which is a state bill that would ban the use of facial recognition in residential dwellings, he added, "But truly, it's just the first step."
- Samar Katnani, the attorney at Brooklyn Legal Services, which has represented the tenants, agreed. "This is definitely a battle won but the war is still looming," she told Gothamist.
- Controversy over the issue began earlier this year when Atlantic Plaza tenants expressed alarm after learning that Nelson had submitted an application to install the technology back in July 2018. Brooklyn Legal Services drafted a letter of protest on the tenants behalf, noting that the majority of tenants at Atlantic Plaza were black and that studies have shown that facial recognition technology disproportionately impacts people of color.
- Katnani argued that surveillance technologies amounted to a form of tenant harassment, designed to evict rent-stabilized residents. Last month, CNET reported on the sales pitch of a smart home security company called Teman GateGuard that said it could enable landlords to photograph visitors as a way of catching illegal subletting.
- Tenants also said the system was an extreme invasion of privacy.
- “We don’t want to be tracked,” Icemae Downes, a longtime tenant told Gothamist at the time. “We are not animals. This is like tagging us through our faces because they can’t implant us with a chip.”
- Nelson responded by saying that the sole goal of the system was to enhance the security of the building.
- But tenants at Atlantic Plaza balked at that reason, citing the presence of cameras throughout the buildings that are sometimes used to catch tenants committing what they said were minor infractions.
- "We're pretty much surveilled on a 24 hour basis," Rogers said.
- The issue sparked wider awareness of the growing use of facial recognition or other "frictionless" biometric technologies. According to Katnani, there is little legal precedent for regulating facial recognition technology in residential buildings.
- In May, San Francisco became the first major American city to prohibit the use of facial recognition by public agencies, including the police.

- The battle against surveillance technology has only just begun, advocates say.
- Tenants fought off facial recognition technology at their apartment complex and are pushing for legislation to protect others.
- After fighting their landlord for more than a year, tenants at the Atlantic Plaza Towers in Brooklyn, New York, won a small victory by stopping facial recognition from moving into their building. But the real battle against facial recognition and surveillance technology has just begun.
- Nelson Management Group President Robert Nelson, whose company owns multiple properties across New York, including the Atlantic Plaza Towers, told tenants at the apartment complex on Tuesday that he's backing down on his plan to install facial recognition technology there. The decision was first reported by Gothamist on Thursday.
- Tenants are skeptical of the promise. They've yet to receive official paperwork documenting the decision and also worry that Nelson will install the surveillance technology at one of the many other properties he manages.
- "Nelson Management Group has withdrawn its Modification of Services application with the state to implement facial recognition technology at Atlantic Plaza Towers," Nelson said in a statement. "I appreciate feedback from residents and stakeholders throughout this process, and look forward to continued progress on upgrades at Atlantic Plaza Towers."
- Fabian Rogers, one of the tenants behind the pushback at the building, is calling for legislation to protect people from facial recognition in residences. It should guarantee protection against the surveillance technology, not just for his apartment building, but everyone, he said.
- "That's why we're so on top of thinking about official documentation and official legislation so no one has to go through the same fight again like we did," Rogers said.
- Some property managers want to install smart home systems and technology like facial recognition because they consider it a convenience for tenants and a security measure. The technology could deter thieves from entering the building, while also making it easier for residents to get inside.
- Tenants worry the technology is a new way for landlords to keep a close eye on people in their homes. In New York, a smart intercom system was being pitched to landlords as a way of catching and evicting tenants going against the building's code of conduct.
- Property technology is essentially unregulated because it's relatively new. There are no laws covering it, though members of Congress have proposed a bill to keep facial recognition out of federally funded housing. Tenants worry about surveillance and privacy when smart home systems are in place, and have sued landlords for the right to use physical keys.
- When Rogers attended a New York City Council meeting in October, he was struck by how little local officials knew about property technology and how little protection tenants actually had.
- At the meeting, he learned that the city's Department of Buildings and Department of Information Technology didn't keep track of how many properties in New York were using smart home surveillance systems.
- "We talked to City Council members, and they had not even understood this was going on," Rogers said. "You've had buildings that have had this installed since 2013, and they've been unsanctioned this whole time."
- He considers his landlord backing down a victory, but only a "half-step" until legislation is passed protecting all tenants from facial recognition.
- The tenants' successful advocacy could serve as a model for other residents, said Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, author of The Rise of Big Data Policing and a law professor at the University of the District of Columbia.
- "There aren't many successes in pushing back against surveillance technology, so when you see one, there are lessons from it," Ferguson said. "Hopefully it will inspire others to also push back if they're uncomfortable with this facial recognition surveillance technology coming into their homes."
- Until legislation passes, attorneys from Brooklyn Legal Services, which represented the tenants at the Atlantic Plaza Towers, said they're assisting tenants who want to challenge landlords looking to install facial recognition.
- "The tenants' fight is far from over. We continue to encounter tenants across the city whose landlords are subjecting them to facial recognition technology without protection or oversight and we should all be deeply concerned over the collection of tenants' biometric data," Samar Katnani, an attorney at Brooklyn Legal Services' Tenant Rights Coalition, said in a statement. "Until these invasive and biased technologies are banned from residential spaces altogether, tenants and advocates across the city will continue to fight them."

- Atlantic Plaza Towers where the use of facial recognition for resident entry is being proposed.
- Plans to install facial recognition technology in a rent-stabilized property in Brooklyn won’t be blocked by a new directive to the Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) in a bill that will reportedly be submitted in Congress on Thursday. The request for a moratorium on facial recognition used in public housing and assisted living facilities, however, does signal a growing pushback against having the controversial technology installed in residential buildings, including the rent-stabilized Atlantic Plaza Towers.
- Nelson Management Group met with protests and legislative opposition in May when it announced plans to install facial recognition technology at Atlantic Plaza Towers, a 2,100-resident building. Company president Robert Nelson initially told Forbes he intended the property to be a pilot test for outfitting all of Nelson’s 3,000-unit portfolio of properties with facial recognition technology.
- “We believe facial recognition technology is the most innovative and effective means to assure that the property is accessed by the lawful tenants of record,” said Nelson. “Once implemented, we believe this technology will create a more convenient user experience for residents.”
- Residents of Atlantic Plaza Towers were not on board, and 130 tenants filed a legal opposition with New York State's Homes and Community Renewal (HCR), arguing among other things that the system violated rent stabilization laws, such as privacy standards and possible discrimination as multiple studies indicate that facial recognition is less accurate at identifying people who are not white men.
- Nelson Management, which, according to its portfolio website, has spent $10.5 million on improvements since buying Atlantic Plaza Towers in 2006, must receive approval by state agencies before it can outfit the rent-stabilized buildings with the contested technology.
- The move would create one more barrier for residents to access their homes, tenants and advocates say. According to City Data, the Ocean Hill neighborhood where Atlantic Plaza Towers sits is around 60% black, with the second-largest racial group being Hispanic, comprising around 20% of the tenant population. What’s more, 90% of the property’s residents are people of color and 80% are women.
- “Whether the technology was 100% accurate or not, the idea of a community living under a constant state of surveillance, even at home, is problematic,” says Representative Yvette Clarke (D–New York), who, along with and Assemblywoman Latrice Walker (D–New York) penned a letter to the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal asking that Nelson Management be prohibited from installing facial recognition.
- “Constitutionally we all have the right to privacy, the fact that you have an entity that you’re paying money to have decided that it’s going to document your comings and goings without accountability is a huge violation,” said Clarke.
- While 6% of Atlantic Plaza Towers protested adding the technology, several tenants told Forbes that Nelson Management couched the facial recognition proposal as an upgrade to the property. Tranae Moran, who has lived at the rent-stabilized property for 27 years, says a 30-page packet was sent to tenants, with a reference that facial recognition would be installed in the building. She says the language used to explain what Nelson planned to implement was so unclear that some residents mistakenly agreed to use the technology.
- “It seemed like they wanted people to ignore the notice, or roll over and say, ‘Okay, this is what [Nelson] is doing, and we have to put up with it if we want to live here,’ ” she says.  Moran also questioned Nelson’s insistence that Atlantic Plaza Towers be the first of its properties to use the technology.
- “This building is comprised of mostly black women and children,” Moran says. “Why would you install an entry system that doesn’t work well for us? I have a three-year-old son. If he has to go to the bathroom while I’m entering the building what am I to do if I can’t get into the building? I feel like we’re being kicked out of our homes.”
- StoneLock, the company that makes the facial recognition tool Nelson Management planned to use, claims its technology doesn’t see color. A StoneLock executive told Forbes that its technology conducts a texture match analysis that looks for characteristics unique to individuals. The company says this allows them to be independent of gender or ethnicity identification, but Joy Buolamwini, an MIT researcher who studies bias in software, says this is not a fail-safe against bias and inaccuracy.
- “StoneLock’s use of near-infrared (NIR) imaging, proprietary heatmap face templates and a patent-pending approach for biometric identification, which relies on machine learning does not make the technology inherently immune to bias or accuracy disparities among different age, gender, skin type, ethnic or other grouping categories and their intersections,” said Buolamwini in a May statement.
- Buolamwini also notes that the nascent technology is not perfect. “Regardless of the imaging techniques used, a machine learning face-based biometric identification system has risks for bias and accuracy disparities,” she wrote in an amicus letter supporting Atlantic Plaza Towers tenants.
- The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the New York affiliate of the ACLU, was also opposed to using the technology, which the organization believes poses a threat to residents privacy.
- “The imposition of a biometric identification access system for entrance into one’s own home raises constitutional concerns and intrudes on tenants’ rights of self-determination and privacy,” the NYCLU’s letter to NYS Homes and Community Renewal Administrator reads. “Any such technology should only be used with the affirmative, informed consent and explicit opt-in of any tenant, and never as a blanket requirement imposed on tenants as a condition of housing.”
- The $17 billion biometrics industry has yet to establish legal precedent in most states. Remedying a breach of biometric data is not as simple as changing a password and could have lifelong implications for users. Atlantic Plaza Towers residents would rely on the 2008 Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which StoneLock adheres to.
- Regardless of protests, Nelson hasn’t confirmed that there are plans to cancel installation of the technology at Atlantic Plaza Towers.
- “Having a roof over your head should not be conditioned on pervasive surveillance,” Matt Cagle ACLU attorney says. He looks forward to seeing the details of the bill but is optimistic about what it represents. “It’s really exciting to see the mounting momentum against dangerous facial recognition technology.”

- More than 130 residents at a Brooklyn apartment complex oppose plan to use the cameras, whose use, experts say, is quietly expanding in cities
- Tenants in a New York City apartment complex are fighting their landlord’s effort to install a facial recognition system to access parts of the buildings, calling it an affront to their privacy rights.
- The row, which the tenants believe could become an important test case, comes as concern about the spread of facial recognition systems has grown across the US and globally, with law enforcement agencies increasingly relying on the tool.
- San Francisco this month became the first US city to ban city police and government agencies from using it. Private firms are also increasingly keen on the technology.
- At Atlantic Plaza Towers in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, the landlord, Nelson Management Group, is moving to install a new system to control entry into the buildings. It would use facial recognition to open the front door for recognized tenants rather than traditional keys or electronic key fobs.
- More than 130 tenants have, however, filed a formal complaint with the state seeking to block the application.
- “We do not want to be tagged like animals,” said Icemae Downes, who has lived at Atlantic Plaza Towers since it opened 51 years ago. “We are not animals. We should be able to freely come in and out of our development without you tracking every movement.”
- Some residents also fear the move reflects the spreading pressures of gentrification further into the east of Brooklyn, and a desire to attract white, higher-income residents in the buildings, whose tenants are mostly black. They say there is already a culture of surveillance and that if they are suspected of breaking one of the building’s rules, they might find an image of themselves pushed under their doors.
- The management firm insists the sole purpose of the changes would be to use the latest technology to make the buildings safer, and it described claims that it is trying to change the tenant makeup as baseless.
- While government agencies’ use of facial recognition has been under the spotlight, much less is known about the extent of its use in the private sector, experts say, because freedom of information laws do not apply.
- “The vast majority of commercial deployments are secret,” said Alvaro Bedoya, the founding director of the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law.
- “This turns people’s expectations upside down about their privacy. In 2019, most people expect that when they log online, they’re going to be tracked in some way,” he said. “In public, in real life, most people still think they can be a face in the crowd. And up until the deployment of facial recognition technology, they were right … This lets people be tracked in the real world like they are online, and I think that is a pretty basic invasion into our lives.”
- The Brooklyn tenants believe their challenge could have a wider impact as more landlords begin to experiment with facial recognition at residential buildings.
- “We’re not going to stand for it, and we’re asking other renters in the state, not just in the city, to join us – because it’s coming to your house next,” Downes said.
- The two brick high-rises in Brownsville already have security cameras watching the grounds, doorways, elevators and halls. They are also staffed by security guards, and residents must use key fobs to get inside – so tenants are dubious of the landlord’s explanation that facial recognition is necessary to improve security.
- “There’s cameras at every inch of this place,” said Tranae Moran, 27. “It’s endless. They have every piece of data we own. With that equipment, they will have every piece of information that is associated with us, and that’s not necessary.”
- She is afraid that the biometric information collected for the new system would be abused. “I’m afraid of it being shared with third-party agencies. I’m afraid of it being shared with the police. I’m afraid of it being shared with anyone – advertising companies, just everyone. It’s just very sensitive information that I feel our landlord should not have,” she said.
- Already, tenants say that security camera footage is carefully monitored. Residents who walk their dogs in the wrong place or enter the building with a box that looks like it contains a forbidden appliance say they might get an image of the alleged transgression slid under their doors, with a warning notice or a fine.
- So the residents fighting the application suspect the proposal has less to do with improving their own security, and more with attracting new tenants to the buildings in an area of Brooklyn primed for gentrification. “He doesn’t want Spanish. He doesn’t want black. He wants white people to come into the neighborhood,” Moran said.
- The tenants’ complaint, in addition to privacy concerns, cites research that has found that facial recognition algorithms are less accurate when used on black people and women, as compared with white people and men.
- The Nelson Management Group spokesman Chris Santarelli said claims the group wanted to change the demographics in the towers are “baseless and don’t correspond with facts”, adding that tenant turnover has fallen since the group bought the towers.
- Santarelli said the company was pursuing “cutting-edge technology at all our properties to create a safer environment for tenants and provide the highest-quality housing in the rent-stabilized market. “The sole goal of implementing this technology is to advance that priority and support the safety and security of residents,” he said.
- “We have yet to install anything having to do with a facial recognition system. We have engaged a leading provider of security technology for proposed upgrades, which has assured ownership that data collected is never exposed to third parties and is fully encrypted.”
- Santarelli said the complex already has extensive security and the “proposed new technology would compliment those safety amenities.”
- The buildings are governed by New York’s rent stabilization laws, so a change like the one Nelson Management Group is proposing must be approved by the state department of homes and community renewal (HCR). It is the first application for a facial recognition system the agency has received and it is currently“under review”, said the HCR spokeswoman Charni Sochet.
- In New York, buildings including Knickerbocker Village in Manhattan and the Morris Avenue Apartments in the Bronx have implemented facial recognition systems. But their installation has not yet been put to the legal or regulatory test.
- “The field is so unregulated,” said Mona Patel, an attorney at Brooklyn Legal Services, which is representing the tenants. “There aren’t any rules that would govern it, because there aren’t any laws on facial recognition entry systems.”
- The group argues that rent stabilization law requires a landlord to give a tenant a new lease on the same terms as their old lease – and that requiring tenants to turn over their biometric information is a violation of those terms. The residents have only the landlord’s “pinky promise” that he will not share the data with police, immigration authorities, or advertisers, the legal papers say.
- “A state agency should not require state residents to surrender their confidential information to their landlord, who can use it however he wishes,” Patel said.
- Residents are right to be concerned, said Bedoya. Tracking when a resident enters and leaves their building can reveal all kinds of information, he said, from the job they work to what religious services they attend to whether they’re cheating on their spouse.
- “Your work life, your love life, your family life, your religious life – all of that is opened up for display to people using facial recognition to track your comings and goings from the building,” he said.
