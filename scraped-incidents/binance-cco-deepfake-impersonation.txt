- Patrick Hillmann, the chief communications officer at cryptocurrency exchange Binance, claims that a 'sophisticated hacking team' manipulated video footage of his past TV appearances to make an 'AI hologram' of him in order to make people think he was helping them get listed on the exchange.
- According to Hillmann, the AI hologram was able to fool representatives of several cryptocurrency projects in Zoom calls into believing that they were being considered for listing on Binance.
- The listing scheme was discovered when crypto project members contacted Hillmann to thank him for his help in the alleged listing opportunities. However, he had no knowledge of these meetings because he is not part of the listing process at Binance, he wrote.

- Beware of online scammers targeting the crypto community, warns Patrick Hillmann, Chief Communications Officer at Binance.
- 
- When I started at Binance approximately one year ago, I was shocked by the layers of security protocols that new employees had to go through to get set up. Little did I know, the onboarding process was the easy part. Binance employees across the globe undergo regular training and random security checks to ensure they abide by the strict cybersecurity rules in place.
- Despite having previously led one of the world’s largest cybersecurity teams and managed some of the largest data breaches in history (US OPM, Ashley Madison, etc.), I was not prepared for the onslaught of cyberattacks, phishing attacks, and scams that regularly target the crypto community. Now I understand why Binance goes to the lengths it does.
- However, criminals will almost always find a way to adapt to and circumvent even the most secure system. Over the past month, I’ve received several online messages thanking me for taking the time to meet with project teams regarding potential opportunities to list their assets on Binance.com. This was odd because I don’t have any oversight of or insight into Binance listings, nor had I met with any of these people before.
- 
- It turns out that a sophisticated hacking team used previous news interviews and TV appearances over the years to create a “deep fake” of me. Other than the 15 pounds that I gained during COVID being noticeably absent, this deep fake was refined enough to fool several highly intelligent crypto community members.
- Beyond this latest incident, there’s been a recent spike in hackers pretending to be Binance employees and executives on platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, etc. We are prepared to defend our users and our ecosystem. After all, we have the largest and most experienced cybersecurity team in the industry, complete with leading investigators with experience at the FBI, US Secret Service, IRS, Europol, and other reputable agencies with a proven track record of fighting cybercrime. These world-class experts are here to help Binance build a digital asset ecosystem that is safe and secure for all users.
- The first line of defense, however, is always the users themselves. As a member of the crypto community, it’s imperative that you:
- Be vigilant and always take proactive steps to ensure you don’t fall prey to scams and impersonations.
- Use the Binance Verify tool to check whether the account officially represents Binance. Please note that Binance Verify is not foolproof. For example, a scammer can spoof their “from” email address or hide behind the real name of a Binance employee. In both cases, Binance Verify would produce mixed results.
- Report any suspicious activities or accounts to Binance Support.
- Regular users are not the only targets — crypto project teams are now more frequently in the crosshairs.  Scammers often create fake LinkedIn profiles and use them to approach unsuspecting projects with the promise to help them get listed on Binance.com.
- Recall the “Nigerian Prince” scam from the early 2000s — pay a small upfront payment, and you’ll receive a large sum of money later, when the “prince’s estate” is recovered.
- In this case, the equivalent of the large sum of money is having a token listed on Binance.com. But to get there, the projects are asked to pay some money first.  Same trick, different wording.
- Interested projects should make sure to only submit forms via the official listing application link found on the footer of Binance.com. Always double-check if you are on the official Binance domain and not a phishing site.
- Take some time to read through CZ’s listing tips. Token listing on Binance goes through a rigorous due diligence process. There are no shortcuts to getting your project listed on Binance. If someone claims to be a Binance representative and offers an “easy” path to listing, please report them to Binance Support immediately.
- Whether you’re a Binance user or a blockchain startup founder, vigilance is the most powerful weapon. Criminals don’t need advanced technical skills to steal your funds — all it takes is making you believe them.
- If you receive an email from someone claiming to be “Binance staff,” take note of the wording. Spoofed messages often contain subtle mistakes such as spelling, odd syntax, jarring phrases, and misspelled domain names.
- Scammers often spur their victims into action by creating a false sense of urgency. For example, the scam email might say:
- “Your Binance account will expire in a week. To avoid loss of funds, please move your assets into this secure wallet address.”
- Users should always be suspicious of messages asking to transfer money or share sensitive information such as personal details or passwords. For more tips on safeguarding your Binance account, users can refer to our complete security guide.
- Binance has zero tolerance for illicit activity in the crypto space as we see it as one of the greatest threats to the industry’s growth. As a leader in the Web3 sector, we believe that we are responsible for ensuring the ecosystem’s responsible growth – the kind that puts user safety front and center.
- For users, the best defense is using common sense. Follow all our security tips, trust your instincts — and if you feel even an inch of doubt, contact Binance Support immediately.

- By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge.
- Patrick Hillmann, chief communications officer at the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, claims scammers made a deepfake of him to trick contacts into taking meetings.
- Writing in a blog post titled “Scammers Created an AI Hologram of Me to Scam Unsuspecting Projects,” Hillmann claims that a “sophisticated hacking team” used video footage of interviews and TV appearances to create the fake. Says Hillmann: “Other than the 15 pounds that I gained during COVID being noticeably absent, this deep fake was refined enough to fool several highly intelligent crypto community members.”
- The only direct evidence Hillmann offers for the claim is a screenshot of a conversation with an anonymous individual who claims to have had a Zoom call with Hillmann. Hillmann denies it, and his interlocutor responds: “they impersonated your hologram.”
- When reached for comment by The Verge, Hillmann said: “I have only seen a still capture of the supposed deep fake which was shared by one of the teams that took part in a call. We are not sharing that now because we have been advised by the team investigating the matter that specific details of the deep fake being made public might result in further copycats.”
- Hillmann added that at least four groups reached out to him to say they’d had a call with someone using his likeness, and that Binance’s cyber investigations team was looking into the case. “Our hope is to prevent other projects from falling prey to these types of scams,” he said over email. “There is no way for us to know the extent of this scam because it was perpetrated completely outside our ecosystem on platforms like Telegram and LinkedIn.”
- Fears of deepfake scams have, so far, outstripped real-world damage
- Although there has been much discussion of the potential of deepfakes to impersonate people in video calls, there have been no definitively confirmed cases to date. Audio deepfakes have been used to impersonate people over the phone, and video deepfakes have been shared on social media to boost scams (a recent example used a deepfake of Elon Musk, a common target for impersonation in crypto scams). But it’s not clear if the technology in its most accessible form is sophisticated enough yet to sustain an impersonation during a live call. Indeed, experts recommend that the simplest way to tell if you’re talking to a deepfake is simply to ask the individual to turn their head, as machine learning models used to create the deepfake do not generally include a face’s profile.
- Meanwhile, fear of the threat of deepfakes is much more widespread. In 2021, for example, European politicians claimed they’d been tricked by a deepfake video call of a Russian dissident. However, reporting by The Verge revealed that the incident was the work of Russian hoaxers who used only makeup and deceptive lighting to impersonate their target.
- On the other hand, the world of cryptocurrency is certainly rife with scams based on impersonation. These are usually more low-tech, relying on stolen photos and videos to populate fake social media profiles, but given the highly technical communities that follow crypto, it’s not implausible that people might try their hand at a more sophisticated plot. It’s also certainly true that the potentially lucrative proceeds of crypto scams make individuals like Hillmann extremely attractive targets for impersonations. A deepfake of a crypto exec could be used to boost confidence in a scam project or seed information that would turn the market in a desired direction.
- Update, August 24th, 13:50AM ET: The story has been updated with comment from Patrick Hillmann.

- The scammers used previous TV appearances of Binance's Chief Communications Officer to create the deepfake.
- I've been with PCMag since October 2017, covering a wide range of topics, including consumer electronics, cybersecurity, social media, networking, and gaming. Prior to working at PCMag, I was a foreign correspondent in Beijing for over five years, covering the tech scene in Asia.
- It’s common for scammers to impersonate companies or executives through fake email accounts or social media profiles. But one group of fraudsters decided to take things further by creating an AI-powered “deepfake” of an executive at cryptocurrency exchange Binance.
- The scheme targeted Binance’s Chief Communication Officer, Patrick Hillmann, who recounted the incident in a blog post(Opens in a new window). “It turns out that a sophisticated hacking team used previous news interviews and TV appearances over the years to create a ‘deep fake’ of me,” he wrote.
- This allowed the fraudsters to impersonate Hillmann in virtual meetings with cryptocurrency developers. Deepfakes can swap a celebrity’s face over your own, or take existing footage and manipulate the subject's lips to say something else.
- In this case, the scammers seem to have used a real-time deepfake of Hillmann during Zoom calls. The Binance executive only learned of the scheme when he began receiving messages from people thanking him about listing their cryptocurrency projects on Binance. “This was odd because I don’t have any oversight of or insight into Binance listings, nor had I met with any of these people before,” Hillmann wrote.
- One of the messages then indicated Hillmann was a participant in a Zoom call. In response, Hillmann said “that wasn’t me.” This led him to uncover that fraudsters were using a LinkedIn profile belonging to a fake Binance “listing” employee named Mark J. Marshall. Presumably, the fraudsters were using the since-deleted LinkedIn profile to set up the Zoom meetings with the cryptocurrency developers.
- The deepfake of Hillmann was then likely deployed to add legitimacy to the Zoom sessions.  “Other than the 15 pounds that I gained during COVID being noticeably absent, this deep fake was refined enough to fool several highly intelligent crypto community members,” Hillmann added.
- The incident underscores the danger of deepfake technology entering into the hands of cybercriminals. In June, the FBI warned that scammers were already using deepfakes to impersonate job candidates during interviews for remote positions. This included the use of voice-based deepfakes to secure jobs that had access to sensitive information, including financial records and corporate IT databases at companies.
- Hillmann wrote the blog post to warn cryptocurrency developers to be on guard when receiving messages that seem to come from Binance. “Beyond this latest incident, there’s been a recent spike in hackers pretending to be Binance employees and executives on platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, etc,” he said.
- Hillman went on to say the scammers impersonating Binance will offer cryptocurrency developers a chance to list on the exchange, but for a fee, which the fraudsters can steal. Fortunately, there’s an easy way to tell if you’re encountering a real-time deepfake over a Zoom call. Currently, the technology struggles to render fake faces over a person when they turn sideways or place a hand over their face.

- When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
- Deepfake of Binance CCO used on video calls to trick start-ups
- A new high-end cryptocurrency scam is using AI-powered deepfakes to scam victims out of their money.
- For a crypto start-up, having their tokens listed on global hub Binance is typically one of its initial major goals, giving  them much-needed legitimacy, as well as exposure to a huge number of cryptocurrency traders and holders. In turn, this usually results in an increase in the token’s price and consequently, gives the project even more legitimacy, and exposure to an even bigger audience.
- But getting listed on Binance is no simple task, as the company is very careful who it chooses (among other things, due to the fact that it’s not allowed to list securities), so the process is sometimes long and quite painstaking. But more importantly - it costs money.
- A fraudster (or a group), well-aware of the process, went on the hunt for such projects. Using artificial intelligence, they created a deepfake of Binance chief communications officer (CCO) Patrick Hillmann, and used it on multiple video calls with potential listing candidates, all with the goal of having them pay for the “listing”.
- “It turns out that a sophisticated hacking team used previous news interviews and TV appearances over the years to create a “deep fake” of me,” Hillmann said in a Binance blog post. “Other than the 15 pounds that I gained during COVID being noticeably absent, this deep fake was refined enough to fool several highly intelligent crypto community members.”

> Deepfakes could be the next big security threat to businesses

> Here's our list of the best identity management software right now
- Hillmann discovered the identity theft scheme after one of the victims reached out to thank him for all his help in getting the project listed. As it turns out, Hillmann is not involved in the listing process, at all.
- He did not say which projects got duped, or how much money was lost. After all, Binance doesn’t have a fixed fee for these things but rather goes for whatever number the project is comfortable with. “Show your willingness to contribute to social impact,” the company says.

- A recent report from a Binance executive reads more like a tech lingo bingo card than a warning about online stranger danger. Apparently going the usual route to hack crypto projects was a little too “lo-fi” for some crafty scammers, as the crypto exchange announced that hackers had a hologram deepfake to defraud several crypto projects out of their funds.
- Binance Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillmann wrote in a blog post last week that internet scammers had been using deepfake technology to copy his image during video meetings. He started to catch on to this trend when he received messages from the leadership of various crypto projects thanking him for meetings he never attended.
- Hillmann shared one screenshot of messages sent over LinkedIn with one supposed project leader telling the Binance exec somebody had impersonated his hologram. The communications officer wrote that a team of hackers had used old interviews found online to create a deepfake of him. Hillmann added that “Other than the 15 pounds that I gained during COVID being noticeably absent, this deep fake was refined enough to fool several highly intelligent crypto community members.”
- Binance is ranked as one of the biggest crypto exchanges by far when comparing trading volume, which likely makes it it a high value target for scammers looking to squeeze both crypto users and project leaders out of their money.
- The exec did not state how many of these crypto projects have been scammed, but apparently, there’s been a rash of hackers faking themselves as Binance staff on multiple social platforms including Twitter, LinkedIn, and Telegram, Hillmann wrote. These fake accounts approach various leads of up-and-coming crypto projects, asking them to pay a fee for the honor of having their projects listed on Binance. The problem has become common enough that Binance has a tool to verify whether a source actually represents the exchange.
- “Over the past month, I’ve received several online messages thanking me for taking the time to meet with project teams regarding potential opportunities to list their assets on Binance.com,” Hillmann wrote. “This was odd because I don’t have any oversight of or insight into Binance listings, nor had I met with any of these people before.”
- The fact that these execs were not only targeting crypto users, but crypto project teams as well, points to just how prolific scams and hacks are in the larger crypto community. The FBI has said users are being regularly scammed by fake crypto apps, losing about $42 million in total over the past year. While some of the largest crypto heists have involved hackers infiltrating web3 networks, usually abusing security flaws found in connected web2 applications, other scams called “rugpulls” get users to sign up with false promises before simply taking the funds and disappearing.
- Of course, Binance isn’t immune to user complaints. Gizmodo’s past reporting uncovered hundreds of complaints filed with the Federal Trade Commission against the exchange, many arguing that they put their crypto into Binance but were restricted from withdrawing it. Others said they were scammed by people pretending to be customer support for Binance, which in previous years did not have a customer support phone number available. The company now has a support center which shows up as one of the first options in Google searches. Of course, part of the issue is that Binance does not claim any home country for their HQ arguing they are “decentralized.” One of their main offices is located in the Cayman Islands, though even that vague designation has come under scrutiny in the past.
- Still, sophisticated deepfake technology has been a tough nut to crack for many high-profile individuals. Researchers have proved many online accounts on LinkedIn are AI-generated. Law enforcement officials have said that deepfakes are being used more and more to apply to remote jobs. The best way to tell a deepfake from an actual human is to watch for any video defects or visual glitches or skin texture that doesn’t seem real. Still, many scammers use low-quality cameras to try and mask any sign the person behind the camera is a digital image.

- Binance's chief communications officer says hackers used a deepfake of his image in Zoom calls to scam cryptocurrency executives. Patrick Hillmann claims the hackers successfully duped crypto project representatives into thinking he would help their tokens get listed on Binance's exchange.
- In a blog post spotted by Bitcoin News, Hillmann wrote that the scammers built the deepfake based on his interviews and TV appearances. Hillmann learned about the deception after receiving messages thanking him for discussing listing opportunities. However, he said he didn't meet with any of those people and that he's not involved in Binance's listing process.
- "This deepfake was refined enough to fool several highly intelligent crypto community members," Hillmann wrote. It's not clear how many crypto projects were affected by the scam or how much the folks behind them may have paid for the promise of a Binance listing. Binance doesn't have a set figure for listing fees. It asks projects to propose a number they're comfortable with and donates fees to charity.
- Hillmann notes that Binance has stringent cybersecurity rules. Still, that won't stop hackers from trying to impersonate its workers. "There’s been a recent spike in hackers pretending to be Binance employees and executives on platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Telegram, etc," Hillmann wrote. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently warned that there are around 7,000 purported profiles of the company's employees on LinkedIn, but only around 50 are real.
- It's not the first time criminals have impersonated executives with the help of technology. In 2019, a scammer pretended to be the CEO of an unnamed company by using artificial intelligence to mimic that person's voice. They asked the head of a subsidiary to transfer $243,000 to a supplier. Of course, that money never arrived at its intended destination.
- Last year, someone used a deepfake of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's chief of staff to dupe politicians in the Netherlands into having a video call with them. Facebook took down a deepfake of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in March, shortly after Russia invaded his country.

- When a cryptocurrency executive started to receive messages thanking him for attending virtual meetings he had never been at, alarm bells rang.
- Hackers had made a “deepfake” version of him, using videos to create a lifelike impression which they could deploy in attempted scams.
- Patrick Hillman, chief communications officer at Binance, the world’s largest exchange by volume for trading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, wrote in a blog post: “Over the past month I’ve received several online messages thanking me for taking the time to meet with project teams regarding potential opportunities to list their assets on Binance.com. This was odd because I don’t have any oversight of or insight into Binance listings, nor had I met with any of these people before.

- The head of communications for the cryptocurrency platform said scammers tricked crypto project founders into meetings using a deepfake of him.
- Scammers often impersonate companies or executives through fake emails and social media profiles. Now fraudsters have reportedly taken things to the next level by creating a “deepfake” of an executive at Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency platform.
- Patrick Hillmann, the chief communications officer at Binance, claims that a “sophisticated hacking team” used video footage of his past TV appearances and digitally altered it to make an “AI hologram” of him and trick people into meetings.
- In a company blog post**,** Hillman warned users to be vigilant following the incidents.
- “Other than the 15 pounds that I gained during COVID being noticeably absent, this deep fake was refined enough to fool several highly intelligent crypto community members,” he wrote.
- Hillman said that he was alerted to the situation after receiving a number of messages online thanking him for meetings which he had never attended.
- The scam, he said, centred on tricking project teams into believing a Binance official was meeting with them regarding opportunities to have their tokens listed on the Binance platform - a potentially lucrative step for crypto projects.
- Despite the wealth of security experts and systems he highlighted at Binance, Hillman insisted users must form the first line of defence against scammers.
- They can do this by being vigilant, using the Binance Verify tool, and reporting anything suspicious to Binance support, he wrote.
- “I was not prepared for the onslaught of cyberattacks, phishing attacks, and scams that regularly target the crypto community.
- “Now I understand why Binance goes to the lengths it does,” he added.
- The only evidence Hillman posted of the situation was a screenshot of a chat with a person asking him to confirm a Zoom call they had previously had.
- Hillman responds: “That was not me,” before the unidentified person posts a link to somebody’s LinkedIn profile, telling Hillman “This person sent me a Zoom link then your hologram was in the zoom, please report the scam”.
- Deepfakes are a growing problem in the era of misinformation and artificial intelligence, with technological progress making convincing digital impersonations of people online more feasible.
- They are at times super realistic forgeries that have triggered alarm globally, especially when they are used in a political context.
- In March this year, a deepfake video of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was posted online, with the digital impersonation of the leader telling citizens to surrender to Russia.
- One version of the deepfake was viewed more than 120,000 times on Twitter.
- The European Union has targeted deepfakes in its battle against disinformation, recently requiring tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to take measures to counter the practice or risk heavy fines.

- Fraudsters used deepfake technology to impersonate the identity of a senior Binance official in online meetings with clients, the crypto exec has claimed.
- Binance claims to be the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, making it a popular target for threat actors.
- Chief communications officer (CCO) Patrick Hillmann said in a new blog post that he was shocked at the “layers of security protocols” new starters had to navigate during onboarding.
- “Despite having previously led one of the world’s largest cybersecurity teams and managed some of the largest data breaches in history (US OPM, Ashley Madison, etc.), I was not prepared for the onslaught of cyber-attacks, phishing attacks, and scams that regularly target the crypto community. Now I understand why Binance goes to the lengths it does,” he explained.
- “However, criminals will almost always find a way to adapt to and circumvent even the most secure system. Over the past month, I’ve received several online messages thanking me for taking the time to meet with project teams regarding potential opportunities to list their assets on Binance.com. This was odd because I don’t have any oversight of or insight into Binance listings, nor had I met with any of these people before.”
- It transpired that fraudsters had impersonated Hillmann using AI-based technology, he claimed.
- “It turns out that a sophisticated hacking team used previous news interviews and TV appearances over the years to create a ‘deep fake’ of me,” he said.
- “Other than the 15 pounds that I gained during COVID being noticeably absent, this deepfake was refined enough to fool several highly intelligent crypto community members.”
- The scam appears to have been one of the first reported attempts at using deepfake technology to impersonate an individual via video display. Up until now most attacks have used audio to trick their victims.
- The FBI warned earlier this year of scammers inviting enterprise participants to an online collaboration meeting. When they joined they would be met by an apparently ‘frozen’ image of their host accompanied by deepfake audio urging them to wire money to an external bank account.
