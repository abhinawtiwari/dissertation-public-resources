- Muharrem İnce pulls out just days from close election race saying alleged sex tape is deepfake
- The Turkish presidential candidate Muharrem İnce withdrew from the race after the release of a purported sex tape, boosting chances of outright success for other candidates in a race that polls suggest will be close.
- İnce, a two-time presidential candidate who also lost to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in 2018, pulled his candidacy just days away from Turkey’s most consequential election in a generation saying: “I offered Turkey a third option, a third way. We couldn’t succeed with this way.”
- The former school headteacher and longtime member of the Republican People’s party (CHP) said an alleged sex tape circulating online was a deepfake, using footage taken from “an Israeli porn site”.
- He added: “If I had such images of myself, they were taken secretly in the past. But I do not have such an image, no such sound recording. This is not my private life, it’s slander. It’s not real.”
- Polls indicate that the vote for the presidency will be a close one, where each candidate needs to get more than 50% in the first round to win outright, or face a runoff two weeks later. Erdoğan will now face CHP’s chairman, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, and the ultranationalist Sinan Oğan of the Victory party in a three-way race.
- İnce had a small spike in popularity in the polls in which he peaked at roughly 10% of the overall vote share and more recently dropped down to almost 2% in some polls. While İnce had long seemed unlikely to win, his dwindling vote share was still enough to ensure that the presidential race would go to a runoff, a scenario observers believe could favour Erdoğan.
- İnce formed his breakaway Homeland party two years ago after two failed bids to become party chairman of the CHP, plus a failed presidential run. Kılıçdaroğlu has led the CHP since 2010, and is spearheading a six-party opposition coalition hoping to defeat Erdoğan after 20 years in power.
- Hours after İnce quit the race, Kılıçdaroğlu invited him to join the opposition coalition by tweeting a link to a classic Turkish ballad. “Let’s put aside the old resentments,” he told his former rival. Oğan reportedly cancelled a planned rally and called a meeting of his advisers, but party officials declared he had no plans to withdraw.
- The polling organisation Metropoll predicted late last month that İnce voters would predominantly give their votes to Erdoğan’s AKP, the CHP, with some also going to the far-right Nationalist Movement party and the nationalist İyi (Good party) in the parliamentary race.
- The high-profile deployment of deepfake videos has already hit Turkey’s 45-day election cycle, after Erdoğan played an alleged deepfake that claimed to show banned Kurdish militants declaring their support for Kılıçdaroğlu at a pre-election rally last weekend.
- “What I have seen in these last 45 days, I have not seen in 45 years,” said İnce.

- The purported video of Muharrem Ince has shifted the balance of the landmark election. Image manipulation like this is just the start...
- For months he had stubbornly resisted calls to step aside and make way for Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the man seeking to become Turkey’s next president at too-close-to-call elections on Sunday 14 May. But then, on Thursday, so late in the day that ballot papers with his name on them had already been printed, Muharrem Ince suddenly backed down.
- “I am withdrawing from the candidacy. I am doing this for my country,” he said. But not, it transpired, of his own free will. Instead, the 59-year-old insisted, he was the victim of a smear campaign. A sex tape, he said, had been swiped from “an Israeli porn site” and doctored to make it appear as if he was involved. “This is not my private life, it’s slander. It’s not real.”
- But the effects of his withdrawal could be very real. Though Ince was polling only around 2 per cent ahead of the election, most of his backers are now expected to shift their support to Kilicdaroglu, who is seeking to unseat Turkey’s increasingly autocratic leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan after two decades in power. And with polls putting Kilicdaroglu on 49.3 per cent to Erdogan’s 43.7 per cent, a handful of extra votes is all the challenger needs to cross the 50 per cent threshold and avoid a run-off against an incumbent famed as a political survivor. Yet should it prove decisive, the alleged sex tape would only prove the most dramatic fakery in a campaign that has been marked by misinformation and accusations of foreign meddling – accusations that saw Kilicdaroglu, 74, denounce “montages, plots, [and] Deep Fake tapes” – referring to realistic AI-generated videos of people saying or doing things they haven’t done.
- The target of his ire was Russia, long seen as an ally of his electoral opponent Erdogan. And analysts suggest such dirty tricks from Moscow would make sense. “Russia is definitely favouring Erdogan [in the election],” says Galip Dalay at Chatham House. “They have energy and grain deals. Putin can even meet Erdogan, head of a Nato country, and so say he is not isolated and that the Nato front is not united.”
- Yet Erdogan subsequently suggested that his rival’s accusations of Russian interference were no more than a ruse to deflect attention from the real culprit. “One of the candidates withdrew,” he said after Ince stood down. “Of course, it is impossible to understand why. What did [Kilicdaroglu] come up with? A tape. How did he do that? All they know is tricks.”
- And just as Russia has reason to back Erdogan, Israel – provenance of the doctored sex tape, according to its victim – may have reason to see Turkey’s president unseated. “There has been difficulty, real bad blood between Israel and Turkey over the past decade,” says Dalay. “One can assume Israel would back the opposition.”
- Whatever the truth about foreign meddling, though, there is little doubt that the world is watching Turkey’s election, freighted as it is with stunning geopolitical significance. Turkey has long played what an intelligence source calls “the man in the middle” – trying to leverage its position as both a Nato member and a country with close ties to Moscow. It also has a critical role in controlling the flow of refugees into Europe and, despite Erdogan’s increasingly dictatorial instincts, remains a large Muslim democracy in a region hardly overflowing with them.
- With the war in Ukraine, however, the stakes have got even higher, as West and East both try to bring the world’s 11th biggest economy further into their camp. “And Turkey,” says the source, “is trying to juggle both sides.” On one hand, Ankara is blocking Sweden’s accession to Nato and buying Russian gas, but on the other, “it isn’t turning a blind eye to weapons smuggled through Turkish territorial waters. And nor has Erdogan started arguing Putin’s case in the Western camp.”
- Yet if the elections are vital for the world beyond Turkey’s borders, they are also critical for Turkey. The opposition claims they are a chance to restore the country’s battered economy, whose plummeting currency and soaring 40 per cent-plus inflation has created a cost of living crisis that has made many Turks dramatically poorer. Erdogan insists, however, that only he can prevent the restoration of a secular, metropolitan elite dragging the country from its cultural roots. Turkey, he says, can be powerful and prosperous without sliding inexorably Westwards.
- It is a clash of civilisations viewpoint that perhaps explains why his campaign has allegedly stooped to its own video deception, playing film at a rally that appears to stitch together footage from a genuine campaign video by his rival with images of Murat Karayilan, one of the founders of the Kurdish PKK separatists, as if to suggest Kilicdaroglu was endorsed by a group regarded as terrorists by the EU and the US State Department. A German media investigation found that the clips came from two entirely separate videos and the Turkish opposition was not being endorsed by the PKK.
- Now accusations fly back and forth of truth-bending and image manipulation so voters cannot know if they can trust their eyes. Kilicdaroglu says Erdogan “can make negative propaganda by changing sound and images”, going so far as to suggest his rival is in league with foreign agents, presumably Russian. “We’ve learned that they’ve made agreements with some hackers from abroad and made payments in Bitcoin,” he said. This week he insisted, after directly accusing Russia, via tweet, of meddling: “I wouldn’t tweet if we didn’t have concrete evidence. We find it unacceptable for another country to intervene in Turkey’s election process in favour of a political party. I wanted the whole world to know this.”
- If there is a deal with Moscow, says the intelligence source, it would represent “classic Russian tactics”. The exchange goes as follows: “If we can help you win the election, if we do you a favour when you’re in power, you’re going to have to do us a favour.” Sophisticated deep fake videos and other visible elements of a disinformation campaign are useful, the source continues, because they help the outside nation behind them, such as Russia, “demonstrate proof that they helped the candidates get elected, firstly to give them leverage when they want to call in favours, and secondly, to use as blackmail if the favours aren’t returned.”
- If Turkey’s election is a live demonstration of the destructive havoc that AI and other advanced technologies can wreak on democracies, then democracies themselves can find it hard to respond in kind to such underhand meddling. To intervene in a foreign election, a British deep fake operation would require authorisation at cabinet or prime ministerial level, if it was done at all. “We have the capacity, we just don’t have the policy permissions,” says the source. In an emergency, getting those permissions would take “time and effort. These [Russian] guys can just go and do it in a couple of hours with little or no oversight.”
- Instead, efforts are directed at “counter disinformation”. “What we can do very quickly is expose the truth.”
- But in the end even that may not prove enough. “Deep fakes are very worrying,” says the source. “We’re probably already at the stage where a video could emerge of Rishi Sunak declaring war on China and you wouldn’t be able to tell if it was real.” Today, with Europe’s worst fighting in 70 years raging across the Black Sea opposite Turkish shores, such provocative fakes may change the course of elections. Soon they may start the wars themselves.

- [1/4] A woman looks out of a building with a poster of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan as supporters of Kemal Kilicdaroglu, presidential candidate of Turkey's main opposition alliance, gather during a rally ahead of the May 14 presidential and parliamentary elections, in Bursa, Turkey May 11, 2023....

- May 11 (Reuters) - The man challenging Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey's presidential elections this weekend received a boost on Thursday when a small party candidate abruptly withdrew and a closely-watched poll gave him a more than five percentage point advantage.
- The withdrawal by Muharrem Ince, one of four contesting Sunday's presidential vote, could reshape the last days of campaigning in what is seen as Erdogan's biggest test in his two-decade reign.
- Turkey's main stock index jumped 6% after Ince made the shock announcement in front of his party's headquarters in Ankara. Financial markets are on edge given Kemal Kilicdaroglu has pledged to reverse Erdogan's unorthodox economic policies.
- Turkey's sovereign dollar bonds rallied with longer-dated issues rising as much as 2.5 cents in the dollar to change hands at over 82 cents – levels last seen more than a year ago.
- The survey by pollster Konda put support for Erdogan on 43.7% and Kilicdaroglu on 49.3%, leaving him short of the majority needed to win in the first round and suggesting the election would go to a run-off between the two men on May 28.
- The survey was carried out May 6-7, before Ince's announcement. "The possibility of Kemal Kilicdaroglu winning has increased with Ince's withdrawal. I would not be surprised if he got 51%," said Bekir Agirdir, manager of Konda, speaking on news website T24 after the announcement.
- The findings in the Konda poll were largely in line with some other surveys that put Kilicdaroglu ahead. He was named candidate of a six-party opposition alliance and also heads the Republican People's Party (CHP), the banner under which Ince unsuccessfully ran for president in 2018.
- Erdogan's re-election bid has been complicated by a cost-of-living crisis, triggered by a lira slump and soaring inflation, and a devastating earthquake in February which killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey and left millions homeless.
- Ince, who had 2.2% support in the Konda poll, said he had been the target of a smear campaign.
- "I am withdrawing from the candidacy. I am doing this for my country," he said, but he did not back another candidate and asked people to vote for his party in the parliamentary elections.
- Erdogan said he was "saddened" by Ince's withdrawal.
- Seckin Yetkin, a 28-year-old dogwalker in Istanbul, said he will now vote for Kilicdaroglu instead of Ince, adding he wanted to avoid a run-off vote.
- "As far as I can see, people are leaning towards voting for Kilicdaroglu so that the election will not go to a run-off. I think Ince's withdrawal is logical strategically," he said.
- Ince had drawn the ire of many of Kilicdaroglu supporters during the campaign for potentially splitting the vote.
- Referring to such claims, Ince said he was withdrawing so that the opposition does not have an excuse for losing the election and couldn't lay the blame on him.
- "There is no doubt that Erdogan is facing a majority that wants change - and that includes younger people," said Asli Aydintasbas, a Brookings Institution visiting fellow. "The only question is whether folks believe Kilicdaroglu is that agent of change."
- "Whether he barely wins or not, I feel like the Erdogan era is over," she added. "Turkish society is ready to move on. And sadly President Erdogan is not leaving behind an institutional governance model."
- The Konda survey put support for the fourth presidential candidate, Sinan Ogan, at 4.8%. Konda had said the majority of Ogan's and Ince's voters were leaning towards voting for Kilicdaroglu in a second round.
- A Metropoll survey also showed the vote going to a second round, with Kilicdaroglu getting 49.1% and Erdogan 46.9%. In a run-off, it showed Kilicdaroglu winning with 51.3%.
- Hakan Akbas, managing director of Strategic Advisory Services, an Istanbul-based political advisory, said Erdogan aims to get to a second round vote against Kilicdaroglu.
- "Given the earthquakes and economic crisis, this would still be a success for him. What matters now even more is parliamentary results," he said.
- If there is a hung parliament, Erdogan could portray himself as bringing stability in a run off, he said.
- The Konda survey put support for Erdogan's ruling alliance on 44.0% in the parliamentary vote, ahead of the main opposition alliance on 39.9%. The pro-Kurdish HDP party, which is backing Kilicdaroglu, is expected to play a 'kingmaker' role.
- Konda said the HDP, running under another party's emblem due to the threat of a court ban, and its leftist allies are seen winning 12.3% of support in the parliamentary vote. That would leave Erdogan and his allies in the minority.
- Konda, which publicly releases only one poll ahead of votes, undertook face-to-face interviews with 3,480 people across 35 provincial centres. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 2.2% at 99% confidence level, Konda said.

- Vladimir Putin’s apparent affinity for a fellow strongman has gotten him dragged into a fiery election scandal thousands of miles away from Moscow.
- ISTANBUL—Turkey’s opposition is accusing Russia of trying to influence Sunday’s elections in order to keep President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in office as several polls suggest he is on the verge of losing power.
- Although Erdogan’s ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin have long raised alarm, a sex tape scandal is shaping up to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.
- Muharrem İnce, a presidential candidate who led the main opposition party in 2018, left the race this week over rumors of an alleged sex tape spread online. The candidate claimed that the tape was a deepfake and said he had gone through a false character assassination.
- Soon after, the presidential candidate for Turkey’s opposition, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, accused Russia of spreading deepfakes and conspiracies, including “tapes that were exposed in this country yesterday.”
- “Get your hands off the Turkish state,” he wrote in a tweet on Thursday.
- Kilicdaroglu told Reuters that he had concrete evidence to back up his statement, but the Kremlin has denied his accusation.
- In an interview with The Daily Beast, a parliament member of the second largest party in Kilicdaroglu’s coalition said that—while he didn’t know the alleged evidence that was behind the statement—it was clear that Moscow was “assisting” Erdogan in his bid to stay in power.
- “For sure that the Russians are intervening differently in the elections,” said Ahmet Erozan, who helps lead foreign affairs for the Good Party.
- Just three days before the election, Reuters reported that Russia was postponing a bill for $600 million in natural gas payments to next year. Erozan, a former ambassador, said the delay in payment was a way for Moscow to contribute to Erdogan’s campaign, adding that there was an “abnormal hike” in trade between the two countries.
- The country’s tanking economy is considered the top reason Erdogan may lose, as massive inflation means citizens are being inundated with rising sticker-shock prices for everything from onions to their gas bills.
- Erozan said that Turkish-Russian ties had gotten “too personal”—dependent on relations between the two leaders rather than one led by state institutions—and Moscow might have to readjust its approach to Ankara.
- “The Russians, they put all the eggs into the basket of Erdogan, all the eggs. Now, after the results of the election, they will come to face the reality,” he said. “Turkey will not be Erdogan’s Turkey.”
- Erzoan believed that billions of dollars in the central bank that was of unknown origins was coming from Russia.
- A person with close contact to the Turkish government said the Russian president wants Erdogan to win because Putin would face less criticism having a president on the global stage with a similar leadership style and political leanings, such as a lack of respect for press freedom.
- “He [Putin] wants more people like him so he doesn’t stand out,” they told The Daily Beast. “If they’re all bad guys they don’t stand out anymore… They’re similar and they survive together.”
- The person compared the situation to when Trump was president, stating that Turkey got less attention about rights and freedoms in the country because the criticism was focused on Trump.
- “When Trump was in office, it was good for us,” they added.
- Hisyar Ozsoy, a MP and deputy chairman with the pro-Kurdish HDP with a focus on foreign affairs, said Erdogan was clearly Putin’s choice for a leader in Turkey. He cited the postponement of gas payments as a top way Russia had helped the Turkish president, which limited the rise in people’s utility bills, as well as sending money to Turkey for the nuclear power plant.
- “President Putin wants Erdogan as his partner in Turkey so those were some of the ways he eased pressure on Erdogan before the elections,” he told The Daily Beast.
- Putin heaped praise on the Turkish president three weeks before the elections during a ceremony for Turkey’s first nuclear power plant, which was funded by Russia.
- Putin said the ceremony and power plant showed how much Erdogan was doing for the country, the economy and “for all Turkish citizens,” Russia’s state news agency TASS reported.
- Putin’s on-camera appearance came as Erdogan canceled in-person events over an apparent illness, giving the Turkish president a boost at a time when his strongman image had been dented.
- “I think Putin supports Erdogan, and clearly would prefer Erdogan,” Gulru Gezer, a former senior counselor at Turkey’s embassy in Moscow from 2017 to 2020, told The Daily Beast.
- She said that Russia has been cautious due to facing speculation of intervening in other countries’ elections.
- “I know the Russians are treating this very carefully,” Gezer said.
- Gezer said the similar personality traits of Putin and Erdogan—including projecting strength and charisma—have helped them bond, and pointed to their nearly monthly phone calls as an example of an uncommonly close relationship between leaders.
- While she stressed that the two countries would have to maintain relations regardless of who wins the election, she said the simple fact that the Russian president has had decades of experience dealing with Erdogan would make it easier to work with him.
- “If he doesn’t respect the person he’s sitting with, he doesn’t have closer ties,” Gezer said. “He also has this relationship based on respect with Erdogan because he knows that when Erdogan gives a promise he delivers it.”
- Gezer said that Turkey’s downing of a Russian fighter jet that Ankara said had violated its airspace showed the Kremlin that the Turkish government would stand its ground.
- Beyond that, Russia easing its financial demands to Turkey has been a big boost for Erdogan.
- The dwindling Turkish lira has broken records for its fall against the dollar this year and the official inflation rate was reported at 44 percent in April. But independent economists have said the number is much higher, sometimes reporting double the rate the government gives.
- Since Turkey is dependent on foreign imports for its energy, that devalued currency has meant a major increase in utility prices—and a lot of the bills are paid to Russia, which has supplied about 40 percent of Turkey’s natural gas imports.

- Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska told Fox News Digital he's concerned about China's use of Artificial Intelligence after a report claimed pro-Chinese groups were spreading CCP propaganda using AI-generated news anchors.
- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s main political opponent accused Russia of using deepfakes and other artificial intelligence (AI)-generated material to meddle in the country’s upcoming presidential election.
- "The Russians have a vested interest in backing an Erdogan presidency to ensure that he basically stays in power, mainly because the Russians benefit [from] driving a wedge between Turkey and NATO, and they've been very successful about that in the last decade or so," Sinan Ciddi, non-resident senior fellow on Turkey at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital.
- "So, in the last several days, weeks, it has been credibly reported by Turkish sources that Russian bot accounts, Twitter accounts, all sorts of disinformation campaigns have started pressing the thumb down on backing the Erdogan presidency, and that comes as no surprise."
- The election, scheduled for May 14 alongside parliamentary elections, has proven difficult for Erdogan as his election rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu maintains a slight lead in opinion polls.

- Kemal Kilicdaroglu accuses Moscow of trying to manipulate the electorate and threatens to cut ties with Kremlin
- The frontrunner in the Turkish presidential elections threatened to cut ties with Russia as he claimed he had evidence of the Kremlin using "deepfake" videos to sway voters.
- "If you want to continue our friendship after May 15, withdraw your hand from the Turkish state,” Kemal Kilicdaroglu demanded in a message written in Turkish and Russian.
- Mr Kilicdaroglu, 74, who is narrowly leading in polls, accused Moscow of trying to manipulate the electorate to help keep his rival, president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in power.
- He claimed on Friday that he had “concrete” evidence proving that Russia is behind videos used by Mr Erdogan’s camp to smear him.
- On Thursday a separate candidate dropped out of the race, claiming his face had appeared in a porn video using deepfake technology.
- But Mr Kilicdaroglu is likely referring to another clip played by Mr Erdogan at a campaign rally last weekend which showed the leadership of the banned Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) singing and clapping to the opposition's campaign song.
- A Kremlin spokesman earlier on Friday denied suggestions that Moscow was working to support one of the candidates in the Turkish elections.
- Putin has enjoyed good relations with Mr Erdogan, whose authoritarian rule and anti-Western rhetoric have mirrored Moscow’s and helped undermine unity in Nato.
- Mr Kilicdaroglu has previously said he will prioritise relations with the West over Russia and Vladimir Putin.
- Opinion polls ahead of Sunday’s vote show Mr Kilicdaroglu is likely to defeat Mr Erdogan, although the election could go to a run-off.
- Mr Kilicdaroglu is now hovering around the 50 per cent mark needed for an outright win on Sunday, while Mr Erdogan is below 45 per cent.
- Muharrem Ince pulled out of the race on Thursday after fake sex pictures featuring his face surfaced on the internet. However, his withdrawal from the race is likely to benefit Mr Kilicdaroglu, throwing into doubt the accusations of Russian meddling.
- Mr Ince accused the authorities of failing to protect his reputation and suggested someone used footage from “an Israeli porn website and added my face on it”.
- Mr Erdogan said he was “sad” Mr Ince was withdrawing but said he had no details about allegations against him.
- Mr Erdogan’s popularity has been seriously dented by runaway inflation. He was also accused of responding poorly to the February earthquake that killed 50,000 people.
- The Turkish president has been trying to boost his ratings by appealing to conservative voters and accusing his opponents of both backing Kurdish terrorists and the LGBT community.
- The Turkish president repeated on a TV show on Thursday night that the video involving Mr Kilicdaroglu was real.
- In an interview on Friday Mr Kilicdaroglu signalled that he would pursue a fine balance in foreign policy over relations with Moscow.
- "We want to maintain our relations, we don't want to break our friendly relations but we will not allow interference in our internal matters," he said.
- Mr Kilicdaroglu also said he would push for another peace initiative between Russia and Ukraine once he wins the Sunday vote.
- "It is very important for us, and for the whole world, if we succeed to reach a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. But we should make it clear that we do not find it right for any country to occupy another country," he said.
- When asked whether he would support Nato enlargement if he is elected as president, he said: "Of course," without elaborating.
- "NATO is not only solely a military organisation in the 21st century, it is also an organisation that defends democracy. We will maintain our relations with NATO within the same framework as we had in the past," Kilicdaroglu added.

- Misleading AI-generated content could swing voters, AI experts say. Sunday’s presidential election in Turkey is the first major vote to face this challenge.
- Turkish Internet users were surprised to discover that Kemal Kilicdaroglu, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s main challenger in Sunday’s election, spoke perfect English in a video posted online two weeks ago.
- “The apple of my eye speaks English too. I promise you grandpa, we’re going to make you president,” a Twitter user commented, sharing the video of the 74-year-old candidate. But two days later, the independent Turkish fact-checking website Teyit revealed the video had been fabricated.
- According to Teyit, which means confirmation in Turkish, the AI-generated video didn’t intend to fool anyone and was initially posted with a disclaimer.
- “I constantly experiment with AI to learn about new functionalities. I created Kemal Kilicdaroglu’s voice on AI and used it for an English version of his candidacy speech,” said @ytc06, who was the first Twitter user to share the video with his 11 followers before it went viral.
- The recent boom in access to AI tools is fuelling these kinds of situations, according to deepfake specialist Henry Ajder.
- “When something designed to be satirical is taken out of context, it can be mistaken as real, especially if you're talking to an audience that has certain biases,” he told Euronews Next.
- “Famous individuals and politicians are particularly at risk because they do a lot of speaking to the camera, staying still, looking straight down the lens. That’s an easier form of video to manipulate than if they’re moving around and their profile is changing,” he explained.
- On the same day the doctored video of him speaking English was released - mostly earning him supporters - Kilicdaroglu warned his social media followers of possible election interference.
- “Playing Cambridge Analytica is beyond your capacity, boys,” he told government officials on Twitter, referring to the unauthorised use of personal data and targeted campaigning on social media to swing the 2016 US presidential election.
- The upcoming Turkish presidential and parliamentary votes could end Erdogan’s 20-year rule and alterthe country’s political landscape. They are also one of the first major elections to deal with such advanced AI.
- “If you can flood sophisticated and very human-sounding speech on large networks and inauthentic accounts with one narrative, that could obviously play a role in taking over a sphere,” said Ajder.
- That’s exactly what Internet users have been trying to achieve in Turkey. Over the last few months, Teyit has contended with a wave of tampered content and has debunked over 150 controversial claims relating to the elections, with eight alone on May 10. Many of these were deepfakes designed to mislead readers by accusing candidates (mostly from the opposition) of terrorism and incivility.
- “It's easy to recognise that kind of content is fake, but it isn’t to people who no longer think critically,” Turkish AI expert Cem Say told Euronews Next.
- The majority of Turks are polarised between Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu, and polls currently predict an extremely close race between the two candidates.
- The incumbent president’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) has repeatedly taken stabs at its competitors, most recently at its biggest rally in Istanbul, on May 7, when an undisclosed edit of Kilicdaroglu’s campaign video was played on giant screens.
- The deepfake version had added in Murat Karayılan, a leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - which is listed by several other countries and the EU as a terrorist organisation - clapping along to the opposition’s campaign song, while lyrics “come on, let’s all go vote” blasted from speakers.
- In a video shared on social media, Erdogan asked an estimated 1.7 million supporters attending his rally “Would my national and local countrymen vote for these people?” before adding: “Look at this, it’s really important!”.
- Another presidential candidate, Muharrem Ince, dropped out of the race on Thursday after the release of an alleged sex tape he said was a deepfake.
- The founder and leader of the centre-left, secular and nationalist Homeland Party, who was Erdogan’s main challenger in the 2018 election, said he had suffered “character assassination” throughout this year’s campaign.
- “What I’ve seen in the last 45 days, I’ve not come across in the past 45 years,” Ince said in his resignation speech.
- “Fake videos, fake pictures… they put my face on a video taken from an Israeli porn website,” he added, blaming the country’s journalists and public prosecutors for not protecting him from the “fury of slander”.
- Experts like Say fear even more aggressive, last-minute tactics. “Deepfakes could be used on election day with the motivation to discourage people from going to the polls or to influence their decision,” he said, adding this would leave “no time for verification”.
- With advances in artificial intelligence showing no sign of slowing down, debunking experts are in a race against AI content generators. Just as in Turkey, deepfakes created by official sources have started making their way onto the political scene in the United States.
- After President Joe Biden announced he’d be running for reelection, the opposing Republican National Committee released an AI-engineered video depicting a dystopian future under a second Biden term. Experts already warn deepfakes will be one of the main challenges of the 2024 US presidential election.
- “The detection side of things is a little bit depressing at the moment,” Ajder said. According to him, tools certifying the provenance of content are promising, but risk creating a media hierarchy: if real content isn’t certified, “people can dismiss it as fake when convenient,” he explained. His recommendation is to stick to media sources that are well-known and can do fact-checking.
- That’s very tricky in Turkey, where 90 per cent of domestic media is under government control, according to the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders. This - combined with an October 2022 law that aims to limit “disinformation” - means very few outlets actually report on deepfakes in Turkey.
- Anadolu, the Turkish government news agency, was accused of withholding the results of the 2019 Istanbul mayoral elections won by the opposition, and this month, a report by the OSCE’s election observation mission raised concerns over the impartiality of the country’s media regulation body, RTÜK.
- Just days before the nation heads to the polls, Turkish independent media outlet 140journos’ post-election series is perhaps the most powerful at imagining what might come next - here again with the help of artificial intelligence. Published in March using the AI image generator Midjourney and the AI text generator ChatGPT, it offers two narratives for Turkey’s future.
- The first story depicts a defeated and freshly retired Erdogan. “In the beginning, it was a bit difficult. However, over time, I took the opportunity to spend more time with my family, to be closer to nature and to spend more time for myself,” a bot impersonating the politician says, while photos of him having tea in a robe illustrate the post.

- In the other narrative, Erdogan has never given up power and Turkey has become a Star Wars-style empire aiming to “build universal peace”.
- To the question “What were the biggest challenges in achieving this success?”, the Erdogan-impersonating AI replies: “One of our greatest challenges was to keep up with the new order of the world and the universe, and to follow technological developments closely and constantly adapt to them” - a nod to the challenge all politicians now face with AI.
