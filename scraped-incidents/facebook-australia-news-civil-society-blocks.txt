- In February 2021, Facebook blocked news journalism on its platform rather than pay the companies that produce it under the Australia's government's proposed News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code that would make platforms pay for publishers' content.
- However, the social network wiped clean the pages of new publishers, as well as of government departments, emergency services, non-profits and charities. Meantime, conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine group pages were left untouched.
- At the time, the move outraged Australians across all sections of society and raised questions about the accuracy of Facebook's content moderation and misinformation systems.
- Both systems had - and continue - to be widely accused of being ineffective, despite Facebook's insistence to the contrary.
- The fracas also led some politicians and commentators to question whether Facebook had deliberately extended its news blocking activities to raise pressure on the Australian government.
- These fears appears to have been realised by a May 2022 Wall Street Journal report based on whistleblower testimony that indicates Facebook designed and used a custom algorithm for deciding what pages to take down that it knew would affect organisations other than news publishers, thereby ratcheting the pressure on the Australian government.
- Facebook restored news to its platform after the Australian government introduced last-minute amendments to the legislation.
- An earlier threat by Google to shut down its search engine in Australia failed to materialise, with the search engine company instead choosing to forge private deals with news publishers.

- 
- The News Media Bargaining Code (or News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code)[1] is a law designed to have large technology platforms that operate in Australia pay local news publishers for the news content made available or linked on their platforms. The law's definition of news is broad,[2] including "content that reports, investigates or explains ... current issues or events of public significance for Australians at a local, regional or national level."[3]: 3  Originating in April 2020, when the Australian Government asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to begin drafting it, it achieved broad support in the Australian Parliament but staunch opposition from Facebook and Google.[4][5] In response, on 18 February 2021, Facebook blocked Australian users from sharing or viewing news content on its platform.[6] The Australian government strongly criticised the move, saying it demonstrated the "immense market power of these digital social giants".[7] A few days later, Australia and Facebook came to an agreement on restoring news pages.[8]
- The bill seeks to "address a bargaining power imbalance that exists between digital platforms and Australian news businesses" which the ACCC identified in its Digital Platforms Inquiry report.[9]
The Australian government hopes it "will ensure that news media businesses are fairly remunerated for the content they generate, helping to sustain public interest journalism in Australia".[10]
- It would require stakeholders to agree to a dollar value of the news content distributed by the platforms, pay that revenue to registered news publishers, and agree to final offer arbitration in the case of a dispute between a publisher and a platform on the value of the news content.[9] The bill defined making "content available" by "if the content is reproduced on the service, or is otherwise placed on the service, or if a link to the content or an extract of the content is provided on the service."[9] Nine Network estimated this amount to be $432 million.[11] The code would also require digital platforms give 28 days notice to Australian news publishers about algorithm changes that could affect links to their news content.[12]
- Proponents of the law argue that the profitability of social media companies is partly attributable to the fact that users can receive news updates even when they do not view the ads on the page of the original publisher.
- The code was supported by media companies based outside Australia The Guardian, the Daily Mail,[13] and News Corp. The bill was also supported by the Australian Press Council.[9] The bill also saw support from public broadcasters, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service, following their amended inclusion in the remuneration stages of the code.[14][15] The bill also saw support from Microsoft, which issued a statement suggesting that the code would be made to work with its search engine Bing.[16] This followed a comment from Google Australia which said the company would pull out of the Australian market if the code was enacted.[17]
- Smaller journalistic entities including The New Daily, Crikey and the Country Press Association have argued that the code favors dominant media companies at the expense of smaller publishers.[9]
- Google criticized the idea as unfeasible, especially the restrictions on when they can change the algorithms for how various sources are ranked.[4] The policy director of the Australian Taxpayers' Alliance called the measure protectionism.[4] Other notable technologists including World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee,[18] journalism professor Jeff Jarvis,[19] New York Times technology journalist Kara Swisher[20] and Stratechery writer Ben Thompson[21] have criticized the code for being technically unworkable. Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who is a prominent activist against News Corp,[22] argued that the code was designed to favour the company's properties.[23] Crikey political editor Bernard Keane criticised Australian mainstream media for allegedly "systematically misleading [their] audiences" over the code and the legislation.[24]
- In December 2017, the Turnbull government directed the ACCC to conduct an inquiry into "competition in media and advertising services markets", focusing in large part on Google and Facebook. The final report published in July 2019 made several conclusions regarding the state of competition in the news and media landscape:[25]
- [We’re seeing] reduced production of particular types of news and journalism, including local government and local court reporting, which are important for the healthy functioning of the democratic process. There is not yet any indication of a business model that can effectively replace the advertiser model, which has historically funded the production of these types of journalism in Australia.
- In April 2020, the Morrison government directed the ACCC to develop a mandatory code “to address bargaining power imbalances between digital platforms and media companies”. The draft News Media Bargaining Code was published by the ACCC in July 2020, and interested parties were invited to make submissions regarding the proposed code.[5]
- In August 2020, Google users in Australia were directed to an open letter protesting the law, which the ACCC characterized as misleading. The letter stated that Google already complies with existing reimbursement programs that are less broad.[11] While in submission phase in Parliament, Google Australia director Mel Silva said the bill was "untenable" and that the company would discontinue access to its search engine within Australia if the code was enacted without changes.[26]
- On 28 August 2020, the ACCC closed the consultation period on the proposal. The code was converted to a bill and sent to Parliament in December 2020.[5]
- The bill caused digital platforms to negotiate payments to local news publishers. By February 2021, Google established deals in anticipation of the code's enactment and negotiated lump sum deals with Seven West Media,[27] Nine Entertainment Co,[28] and News Corp[29] to provide content for the company's new "News Showcase" feature. These deals would mean Google can avoid entering the arbitration stages of the code.[30]
- In August 2020 Facebook stated that the proposed legislation left them "with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits". Facebook warned that if the "draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram".[31] Following the Senate committee endorsing the legislation without pushing for any amendments, on 17 February 2021 Facebook claimed "the proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content"[32] and blocked all Australian news from being shared by anyone on their platform and blocked all news from being seen or shared by users in Australia.[32][33][34][35] Facebook also blocked pages of some government, community, union, charity, political, and emergency services, which were later reinstated.[36][37] The company said this was a result of the bill having a broad definition of news content.[38] For example, as the main provider of weather forecasts, warnings and observations to the Australian public, the Bureau of Meteorology by definition "reports, investigates or explains ... current issues or events of public significance for Australians at a local, regional or national level",[3] and was one of the services initially affected.
- In a Facebook post, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that "Facebook's actions to unfriend Australia, cutting off essential information services on health and emergency services, were as arrogant as they were disappointing."[39] The move by the company saw widespread condemnation by Australian political leaders, and a mixed reaction from Australian residents and experts.[40][41][42][43] The Australian government strongly criticised the move, saying it demonstrated the "immense market power of these digital social giants".[7] The federal government announced it is stopping all its advertising campaigns on Facebook, worth millions of dollars.[44] Days after Facebook's response to the bill and experts predicting that misinformation on Facebook will spread more rapidly,[45] with a spokesperson for one of the country's biggest media companies saying “Facebook will now be a platform for misinformation to rapidly spread without balance”.[46] In late February, technology companies including Facebook and Google released the final version of an industry code to address the spread of misinformation on their services in Australia.[45][47]
- On 22 February Facebook said it reached an agreement with the Australian government that would see news returning to Australian users in the coming days.[8]

- Update on February 22, 2021 at 8:20PM PT:
- We’re pleased that we’ve been able to reach an agreement with the Australian government and appreciate the constructive discussions we’ve had with Treasurer Frydenberg and Minister Fletcher over the past week. We have consistently supported a framework that would encourage innovation and collaboration between online platforms and publishers. After further discussions, we are satisfied that the Australian government has agreed to a number of changes and guarantees that address our core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognize the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them. As a result of these changes, we can now work to further our investment in public interest journalism and restore news on Facebook for Australians in the coming days.
- Read an additional statement from Campbell Brown, VP, Global News Partnerships on our Facebook Journalism Project site.
- Originally published on February 17, 2021 at 10:31AM PT:
- In response to Australia’s proposed new Media Bargaining law, Facebook will restrict publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content.
- The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content. It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter.
- This discussion has focused on US technology companies and how they benefit from news content on their services. We understand many will ask why the platforms may respond differently. The answer is because our platforms have fundamentally different relationships with news. Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue.
- In fact, and as we have made clear to the Australian government for many months, the value exchange between Facebook and publishers runs in favor of the publishers — which is the reverse of what the legislation would require the arbitrator to assume. Last year Facebook generated approximately 5.1 billion free referrals to Australian publishers worth an estimated AU$407 million.
- For Facebook, the business gain from news is minimal. News makes up less than 4% of the content people see in their News Feed. Journalism is important to a democratic society, which is why we build dedicated, free tools to support news organisations around the world in innovating their content for online audiences.
- Over the last three years we’ve worked with the Australian Government to find a solution that recognizes the realities of how our services work. We’ve long worked toward rules that would encourage innovation and collaboration between digital platforms and news organisations. Unfortunately this legislation does not do that. Instead it seeks to penalise Facebook for content it didn’t take or ask for.
- We were prepared to launch Facebook News in Australia and significantly increase our investments with local publishers, however, we were only prepared to do this with the right rules in place. This legislation sets a precedent where the government decides who enters into these news content agreements, and ultimately, how much the party that already receives value from the free service gets paid. We will now prioritise investments to other countries, as part of our plans to invest in new licensing news programs and experiences.
- Others have also raised concern. Independent experts and analysts around the world have consistently outlined problems with the proposed legislation. While the government has made some changes, the proposed law fundamentally fails to understand how our services work.
- Unfortunately, this means people and news organisations in Australia are now restricted from posting news links and sharing or viewing Australian and international news content on Facebook. Globally, posting and sharing news links from Australian publishers is also restricted. To do this, we are using a combination of technologies to restrict news content and we will have processes to review any content that was inadvertently removed.
- For Australian publishers this means:
- For international publishers this means:
- For our Australian community this means:
- For our international community this means:
- The changes affecting news content will not otherwise change Facebook’s products and services in Australia. We want to assure the millions of Australians using Facebook to connect with friends and family, grow their businesses and join Groups to help support their local communities, that these services will not change.
- We recognise it’s important to connect people to authoritative information and we will continue to promote dedicated information hubs like the COVID-19 Information Centre, that connects Australians with relevant health information. Our commitment to remove harmful misinformation and provide access to credible and timely information will not change. We remain committed to our third-party fact-checking program with Agence France-Presse and Australian Associated Press and will continue to invest to support their important work.
- Our global commitment to invest in quality news also has not changed. We recognise that news provides a vitally important role in society and democracy, which is why we recently expanded Facebook News to hundreds of publications in the UK.
- We hope that in the future the Australian government will recognise the value we already provide and work with us to strengthen, rather than limit, our partnerships with publishers.

- Facebook news ban stops Australians from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content
- Australians are being blocked from accessing news in their Facebook feeds, in a dramatic escalation of the social media giant's stand-off with the federal government.
- Australians waking up this morning found they were blocked from viewing or sharing news content from publishers' pages, including news organisations like the ABC.
- The social media giant said it made the move in response to the government's proposed media bargaining laws, which would force major tech giants to pay Australian news outlets for their content.
- The move also prevents people overseas from sharing Australian content on the social media site.
- Treasurer Josh Frydenberg tweeted that he had held "constructive" talks with Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg this morning, while Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said Facebook should "think very carefully about what this means for its reputation and standing".
- Facebook said the proposed Australian law fundamentally misunderstood the relationship between their platform and publishers who use it to share news content.
- Download the ABC News app for all the latest.
- It said it faced the stark choice between attempting to comply with a law, or banning news content on its services in Australia — and "with a heavy heart" it was choosing the latter.
- The move came a day after Nine and Seven West Media reportedly made multi-million-dollar deals with Google for use of content.
- The tech giant says news makes up less than 4 per cent of people's feeds, but you may notice a difference. Let's unpack what the changes mean for you.
- "We understand many will ask why the platforms may respond differently," the Facebook statement said.
- "The answer is because our platforms have fundamentally different relationships with news.
- "Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content."
- A Google spokesperson took issue with this claim, highlighting growing division in the technology sector.
- "All publishers, along with everyone else, always have a choice about whether their site shows up in Google Search," they said.
- The social media giant said it had explained for months that "the value exchange between Facebook and publishers runs in favour of the publishers — which is the reverse of what the legislation would require the arbitrator to assume".
- "Last year Facebook generated approximately 5.1 billion free referrals to Australian publishers worth an estimated AU$407 million."
- The company said what it gained from news content was "minimal", and made up about 4 per cent of what people saw in their newsfeed.
- The legislation implementing the proposed new media code passed the House of Representatives last night. The Senate is likely to pass it next week.
- The code is designed to ensure media companies are paid fairly for the use of their content on search engines and social media platforms.
- Within a couple of years the likes of Google and Facebook will devour more than half local ad revenues, leaving only crumbs for traditional media players.
- Major media companies Seven West Media, Nine, and News Corp have all reportedly struck content deals with Google this week.
- News Corp and Google will develop a subscription platform, share advertising revenue through Google's ad technology services, build out audio journalism and develop video journalism by YouTube.
- The deal comes after years of public feuding between Mr Murdoch and Google, most recently in Australia, where Google has threatened to shut down its search engine to avoid "unworkable" content laws.
- News declined to comment on financial details of the deal, which it said involved "significant payments" by Google.
- The Nine and Seven West Media deals are collectively worth $60 million a year, according to media reports.

- Facebook reinstating health and safety pages but government says damage to reputation has been done
- Facebook's decision to block access to pages like 1800Respect, the WA Department of Fire and Emergency Services and the Bureau of Meteorology was unnecessary, heavy-handed and will damage its reputation, according to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.
- Access to some pages caught up in Facebook's move — made in response to proposed laws that would mean it pays publishers for use of content — was being restored during the afternoon.
- But Mr Frydenberg said the response from Facebook was "wrong".
- "Their decision to block Australians' access to government sites — be they about support through the pandemic, mental health, emergency services, the Bureau of Meteorology — was completely unrelated to the media code, which is yet to pass through the Senate," he said.
- "What today's events do confirm for all Australians, is the immense market power of these digital giants."
- Facebook banned Australian users from accessing news in their feeds on Thursday morning, as the government pursues laws that would force it to pay publishers for journalism that appears in people's feeds.
- The tech giant says news makes up less than 4 per cent of people's feeds, but you may notice a difference. Let's unpack what the changes mean for you.
- Facebook's justification for including non-news pages was that the proposed law has a broad definition of news.
- "As the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted," a statement from the company read.
- Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said he didn't accept Facebook's broad interpretation of news and said he was prepared to work through the issue "if there's some misunderstanding".
- Facebook has said the proposed laws fundamentally misunderstood the relationship between their platform and publishers who used it to share news content.
- It said it faced the stark choice between attempting to comply with a law, or banning news content on its services in Australia — and "with a heavy heart" it was choosing the latter.
- The government continues to hold discussions with Facebook, and it hopes Facebook will overturn its decision, but it remains committed to the laws.
- Mr Frydenberg shared a 30-minute conversation with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday morning, which he described as "very cordial" and "very constructive".
- "We want them to remain in Australia, but we also want them to pay for original content," he said.
- "Yes, there are some differences, but let's see if we can work them through."
- Download the ABC News app for all the latest.
- Following backlash against the extent of the block on Australian pages, including the Department of Fire and Emergency Services WA and the Bureau of Meteorology, Facebook issued a statement saying government pages "should not" be impacted.
- "The actions we're taking are focused on restricting publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content."
- Mr Fletcher said the government would continue to move ahead with legislating the code.
- He said Facebook's decision to remove access to news for Australians raised questions about whether people could trust what they saw on the platform.
- "Facebook needs to think very carefully about what this means for its reputation and standing," he told the ABC.
- "At a time when there are already questions about the credibility of information on Facebook, that is something that they will obviously need to think about."
- Facebook has been criticised for its role in facilitating the sharing of dangerous political content and health misinformation.
- A statement from the company said its "commitment to combat misinformation on Facebook has not changed" and noted it was still directing people to authoritative health information via a COVID-19 Information Centre, and was still providing fact-checking in association with AAP and AFP.
- Australians woke up on Thursday morning found they were blocked from receiving news from publishers' pages, including news organisations like the ABC.
- Mr Fletcher said it meant Facebook was no longer a reliable source of news.
- "We will be making the point that the position that Facebook has taken means that the information that people see on Facebook does not come from organisations with a fact-checking capability, paid journalists, with editorial policies," Mr Fletcher said.
- ABC managing director David Anderson said ABC content would remain available through the website and the app.
- "Despite key issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic having ongoing effects on all Australians, Facebook has today removed important and credible news and information sources from its Australian platform," he said.
- A Nine spokesperson said Facebook's move "proves again their monopoly position and unreasonable behaviour".
- "It is unfortunate Facebook have taken this position, and it will indeed inhibit us from sharing our quality news and information with Australians," they said.
- "Nobody benefits from this decision as Facebook will now be a platform for misinformation to rapidly spread without balance."
- Facebook's move to block news content included non-news pages, including the Department of Fire and Emergency Services WA.
- The department describes the page as "a convenient source" warnings, safety information and news. It has subsequently been restored.
- Facebook pages of small businesses were also affected.
- Sallie Jones from Gippsland Jersey said her dairy business's Facebook posts had been deleted. It was brought back online in the middle of Thursday afternoon.
- "For us not to have Facebook in the first place, which I'm totally freaking out about, but the function of not to be able to share the news links, it's just so disappointing to us as a company," she said.
- Ms Jones said she'd grown her business reach through social media, including by sharing stories from news outlets.
- "I actually don't know what to do because we've built our whole business on Facebook and Instagram and as a start-up little milk brand, so we've relied very much relied on sharing content," she said.
- Even Facebook's ban on international profiles from sharing Australian news content has affected the company in remote Victoria.
- "We have international farmers that follow our page, we're a very local kind of brand, but we have an international reach for the kinds of voices we share," Ms Jones said.
- "I'm really hoping that it's a big mistake."
- The Bureau of Meteorology and sexual assault counselling service 1800Respect were also blocked but were subsequently restored.
- Some pages apparently caught up in the move, such as Harvey Norman, remained offline as of Thursday afternoon.
- The legislation implementing the code passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday night. The Senate is likely to pass it next week.
- Labor leader Anthony Albanese said we needed a debate about how Australians accessed information online.
- "The government needs to outline its strategy for dealing with this," he said.
- "We need to make sure that measures are put in place that protect people's health, that ensure people can get access to the information that they need, when they need it."
- Greens media spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said Facebook "needed to grow up".
- "Facebook has proved this morning they have become far too big, reinforcing the need to regulate this corporate bully."
- The media code is designed to ensure media companies are paid fairly for the use of their content on search engines and social media platforms.
- Major media companies Seven West Media, Nine, and News Corp have all reportedly struck content deals with Google this week.
- The ABC is covered by the proposed code, but is yet to announce a deal.

- Company says it has made decision ‘with a heavy heart’ in response to proposed media bargaining code
- Facebook damaged its reputation by banning Australians from seeing or posting news content on its site in response to the federal government’s news media code, treasurer Josh Frydenberg has said.
- The tech giant’s Australian and New Zealand managing director, Will Easton, said the ban would block links to Australian publishers from being posted, while no Australian users would be able to share or see content from any news outlets, both Australian and international.
- “The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content,” he said in a blog post published on Thursday morning. “It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia.
- “With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter.”
- News sites, including Guardian Australia, show no posts on their Facebook page as of Thursday morning.
- EMPTY! pic.twitter.com/0TfGFv5IhR
- Although Facebook had publicly threatened such action over the code since September last year, the federal government was blindsided by news being pulled, and Frydenberg called a half-hour meeting with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday morning.
- Frydenberg said the company had damaged its reputation.
- “Facebook was wrong. Facebook’s actions were unnecessary, they were heavy-handed, and they will damage its reputation here in Australia,” he told reporters on Thursday.
- Users on Thursday reported seeing a pop-up error window when they attempted to post links to news, stating these cannot be posted in response to the news media code.
- Easton said publishers stood to gain more from sharing content on Facebook than Facebook does, with news content accounting for less than 4% of all content shared, and the company was willing to support news, but only with “the right rules in place”.
- “We hope that in the future the Australian government will recognise the value we already provide and work with us to strengthen, rather than limit, our partnerships with publishers,” he said.
- Fact-checking and Covid-19 information will remain in place to combat misinformation on the platform, but the ban will mean people will not be able to post links from news sites in response to seeing misinformation on the platform.
- This morning, I had a constructive discussion with Mark Zuckerberg from #Facebook. He raised a few remaining issues with the Government’s news media bargaining code and we agreed to continue our conversation to try to find a pathway forward.
- Australia’s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said the move raised questions about the credibility of information now available on Facebook.
- “They’re effectively saying, on our platform, there will not be any information from organisations which employ paid journalists, which have fact checking processes, editorial policies,” he told ABC News Breakfast.
- “They’re effectively saying any information that is available on our site does not come from these reliable sources. I would imagine that on quite sober reflection, they will start to become quite troubled about what that would mean for how their platform is perceived.”
- Frydenberg said conversations with Facebook were ongoing over potential amendments, but the government planned to proceed with the code, which passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
- “[Zuckerberg] did explain to me that they had concerns with aspects of the code, and it goes to the interpretation of some of its elements,” he said.
- “And he will come back to me with some more considered views. And we’ll listen to him and discuss that with the prime minister and with our colleagues. And we’ll make decisions then. But we are committed to the code.”
- Facebook’s move is in contrast to the approach from the other major platform subject to the code, Google.
- Although Google had threatened to withdraw its search engine from Australia if the code went ahead, in the past week, Google has signed agreements with some of Australia’s biggest publishers, including News Corp, Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media, for payment for its News Showcase product. The Nine deal is reportedly worth $30m a year.
- Guardian Australia is also in negotiations with Google over Showcase.

- Easton said publishers stood to gain more from sharing content on Facebook than Facebook does, with news content accounting for less than 4% of all content shared, and the company was willing to support news, but only with “the right rules in place”.
- “We hope that in the future the Australian government will recognise the value we already provide and work with us to strengthen, rather than limit, our partnerships with publishers,” he said.
- Fact-checking and Covid-19 information will remain in place to combat misinformation on the platform, but the ban will mean people will not be able to post links from news sites in response to seeing misinformation on the platform.
- This morning, I had a constructive discussion with Mark Zuckerberg from #Facebook. He raised a few remaining issues with the Government’s news media bargaining code and we agreed to continue our conversation to try to find a pathway forward.
- Australia’s communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said the move raised questions about the credibility of information now available on Facebook.
- “They’re effectively saying, on our platform, there will not be any information from organisations which employ paid journalists, which have fact checking processes, editorial policies,” he told ABC News Breakfast.
- “They’re effectively saying any information that is available on our site does not come from these reliable sources. I would imagine that on quite sober reflection, they will start to become quite troubled about what that would mean for how their platform is perceived.”
- Frydenberg said conversations with Facebook were ongoing over potential amendments, but the government planned to proceed with the code, which passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
- “[Zuckerberg] did explain to me that they had concerns with aspects of the code, and it goes to the interpretation of some of its elements,” he said.
- “And he will come back to me with some more considered views. And we’ll listen to him and discuss that with the prime minister and with our colleagues. And we’ll make decisions then. But we are committed to the code.”
- Facebook’s move is in contrast to the approach from the other major platform subject to the code, Google.
- Although Google had threatened to withdraw its search engine from Australia if the code went ahead, in the past week, Google has signed agreements with some of Australia’s biggest publishers, including News Corp, Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media, for payment for its News Showcase product. The Nine deal is reportedly worth $30m a year.
- Guardian Australia is also in negotiations with Google over Showcase.

- News remains blocked as satirical websites are reinstated and Qanon and anti-vaxxers continue to be unaffected
- Facebook may wait up to a week before unblocking some of the pages of hundreds of non-media organisations caught up in its news ban, while anti-vaccination content and misinformation continues to run rampant on the social media platform.
- Content designated as news was blocked on Facebook in Australia on Thursday morning in response to the federal government’s news media code, which would require the tech giant to negotiate with news publishers for payment for content.
- The decision continued to make waves globally on Friday, with leaders at the virtual G7 summit discussing the issue and US legislators setting out plans for a series of related antitrust bills, starting with one that would make it easier for small news organisations to negotiate with tech giants by allowing them to work as a group.
- In Europe, the European Commission president urged the US to join the EU in creating “a digital economy rulebook that is valid worldwide”. Ursula von der Leyen cited the storming of the US capitol as “a turning point for our discussion on the impact social media have on our democracies”, adding: “We just cannot leave decisions, which have a huge impact on our democracies, to computer programmes without any human supervision or to the board rooms in Silicon Valley. The latest decision of Facebook regarding Australia is just another proof for that.”
- In the UK, Facebook’s Vice-President for Europe, the Middle East and Africa Nicola Mendelsohn defended the decision, telling LBC that the move would establish “an unworkable precedent” and arguing that “publishers choose to put their stories on our news feed because it allows them to sell more subscriptions, it allows them to grow their audiences, and ultimately to increase advertising revenue.” She emphasised that no similar moves were likely in the UK.
- But the social network was under pressure over the continued blocks on public service content affected by its action. It has blamed the situation on the government’s broad definition of what is considered to be “news” in the code. Hundreds of other pages have been barred from posting content, including health department and emergency services pages, family violence support pages, Western Australia opposition leader Zak Kirkup’s page, and even a page for mums in Sydney’s north shore.
- Greg Inglis, the managing director of funeral business Picaluna, told Guardian Australia that Facebook had “killed off” his business’s page yesterday, just after he had paid for a marketing campaign on the platform.
- “We’re just at the very beginning of what for us is quite a big campaign where we’re going to spend quite a bit of money on Facebook,” he said. “And the irony is that they’re cutting off the hand that feeds them. It’s just crazy so it took me two hours down a rabbit hole of trying to find somewhere on Facebook’s website where you can actually contact them.”
- Inglis eventually found a live chat on Facebook where he had to explain his company was not a news business.
- “I spent the first 20 minutes of that live chat trying to explain that we’re a small to medium enterprise, we are not a media organisation. He kept coming back and saying ‘yes but you published stories’. I said ‘but we’re not a publisher they’re stories about funerals, we’re a funeral business’.”
- Inglis was told it could be 72 hours or more before someone would respond to the case lodged by Facebook support.
- Some other pages were restored on Thursday and Friday, but Guardian Australia understands it could be up to a week before many of the pages are even reviewed.
- Tim Hanslow, head of social at Preface Social Media and who also helps run the Australian Community Managers group on Facebook, told Guardian Australia he had heard from a couple of community managers who had been contacted by their Facebook representatives and were told an appeals process would be put in place for people to plead their case.
- He said in a post, shared with Guardian Australia, Facebook had applied the definition of news as per the definition in the code’s legislation.
- “But they are aware some pages have been incorrectly brought down by the ban. It’s clearly been done automatically. They’re compiling a list of pages incorrectly pulled down,” he said.
- “An appeals process for the ban will launch on Feb 25 and you can request your page be assessed as outside the news ban. All of the government pages/sites caught up in this should be reinstated.”
- Guardian Australia has sought comment from Facebook.
- Australian news sites recorded a steep decline in traffic as a result of the block. Audience tracking company Nielsen reported total sessions for news content declined 16% on Thursday compared with the last six Thursdays, while total time spent declined 14%.
- The company said 22% of the audience of Australian media publishers in 2020 accessed their content via the Facebook app.
- Social tracking website Chartbeat also reported overnight that Australian news sites recorded a decline of more than 20% in traffic due to Facebook cutting off news sites. Prior to the change, about 15% of visits to sites within Australia were being driven by Facebook, but after the change, that had dropped to less than 5%, the company said.
- Although satire sites Betoota Advocate and The Chaser were also initially hit by the ban, they managed to have the blocks removed, and as a result accounted for nine out of the Top 10 posts by Australian pages on engagement on Thursday.
- The top-performing link posts by Australian Facebook pages on 18 Feb were from:1. The Chaser2. Betoota Advocate3. Betoota Advocate4. Betoota Advocate5. Ozzy Man Reviews6. The Chaser7. Betoota Advocate8. Betoota Advocate9. The Chaser10. Betoota Advocate
- The Chaser said on its Facebook page on Friday the attention had brought down the website.
- “Our first foray into real journalism has been so popular it completely crashed our website. We’re beginning to understand why the Herald-Sun never publishes proper journalism.”
- Also immune was the YouTube satirist Jordan Shanks, who operates under the moniker Friendlyjordies. Despite promoting himself as a comedian, Shanks has worked with the independent Australian journalist Michael West on stories about New South Wales deputy premier John Barilaro, and would probably fall under Facebook’s application of the government’s proposed definition of “news”. West’s page was hit by the news ban.
- Separately, dozens of pages and groups dedicated to promoting conspiracy theories, anti-vaccination misinformation and the alt-right have continued to operate unhindered by the company’s broad-brush ban on news content.
- In most cases, the groups were able to continue posting misinformation via YouTube and websites which escaped Facebook’s definition of news, profoundly reshaping how Australians consumed information on the social media behemoth.
- One 7,000-member group, which is dedicated to promoting the baseless conspiracy that the 1996 Port Arthur massacre was staged, posted an edited video which uses a 2015 speech by former Liberal party senator Bill Heffernan to falsely allege the existence of a widespread pedophilia network in Australian politics. The conspiracy theory, which has become a key tenet of Australia’s QAnon community, has been shared twice since the ban was introduced.
- In another Australian group, which is dedicated to vaccination misinformation, links to websites pushing that group’s agenda continued to be visible after the ban, as did posts containing false information about the soon-to-be-released Covid-19 vaccine.
- Facebook’s ban also missed alt-right operators such as Avi Yemini, who has previously been banned from Facebook for hate speech and has become a key part of the growing conspiracy movement in Australia by promoting a steady stream of content linked to and shared by the anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination groups. Despite calling himself a “journalist”, Yemini and his associated pages continued to post unencumbered to his more than 100,000 followers on Friday.
- Other far-right pages, including one identified by the Guardian’s hate factory investigation, which uncovered a global network of far-right hate operating for profit through Facebook, also remained unhindered.
- The Australian government is trying to resolve issues with Facebook, but there is no clear timeline on when or if news media will be restored.
- Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg held his second meeting in two days with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg about the company’s ongoing issues with the code, and said on Friday the pair would talk again over the weekend.
- Today I had a further conversation with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg.We talked through their remaining issues & agreed our respective teams would work through them immediately. We’ll talk again over the weekend. I reiterated Australia remains committed to implementing the code.
- The legislation for the code passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday night, and is expected to be debated in the Senate as soon as next week.
- The prime minister, Scott Morrison, repeated that the government would not be backing down from the code.
- “I would just say to Facebook: this is Australia, if you want to do business here, you work according to our rules. That is a reasonable proposition. We’re happy to listen to them on the technical issues of this, just like we listened to Google and came to a sensible arrangement,” he said.
- “But the idea of shutting down the sorts of sites they did yesterday, as some sort of threat, I know how Australians react to that and I thought that was not a good move on their part.
- “They should move quickly past that, come back to the table and we will sort it out.”

- The social media giant made the decision because of proposed laws in the country to make Big Tech pay for journalism.
- By 

	Abid Rahman
- International Editor, Digital
- Facebook has blocked Australian users from viewing or sharing news links on its platform in reaction to proposed new laws in the country that will force tech giants to pay for journalism.
- The new rules for Australian Facebook users mean that they cannot share Australian or international news and international users outside Australia also cannot share Australian news.
- 
- “The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content,” Facebook Australia and New Zealand regional managing director William Easton said in a post on the company’s site.
- 
- “It has left us facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia. With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,” Easton added.

- The company’s decision to take the nuclear option and block news access and sharing has already led to a storm of criticism from the emergency services in Australia who rely on the social media platform to relay vital information on wildfires, floods, extreme weather and COVID-19 among other local interest and public safety issues.
- Australian children’s hospitals, neighborhood watch organizations, charities and NGOs have seen posts removed already, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Thursday, local time.
- The Australian government slammed Facebook for what is a landmark local ban on viewing and sharing news. “Facebook was wrong. Facebook’s actions were unnecessary, they were heavy-handed and they will damage its reputation here in Australia,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said at a press conference in Canberra today.
- “Their decision to block Australians’ access to government sites – be they about support through the pandemic, mental health, emergency services, the Bureau of Meteorology – were completely unrelated to the media code which is yet to pass through the Senate,” Frydenberg added.
- Facebook’s unilateral response to the proposed legislation covering digital news in Australia stands in stark contrast to Google who after an initially intransigent position and threats to withdraw its services from the country is now in negotiations and struck some deals with local media companies, Frydenberg said.
- 
- Google has already struck a deal with Seven West Media (Seven Network, The West Australian newspaper) and is close to commercial agreements with Nine Entertainment (Nine Network, Nine Radio, and major newspapers The Age and Sydney Morning Herald) and national broadcaster ABC.
- On Wednesday, Google has signed a landmark deal with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp to pay for journalism from its global news sites including the company’s Australian assets such as the major daily newspapers The Australian, The Daily Telegraph and Herald Sun as well as its television properties Foxtel and Sky News Australia.

- Outrage fast-followed Facebook’s announcement yesterday that it was making good on its threat to block Australian users’ ability to share news on its platform.
- The tech giant’s intentionally broad-brush — call it antisocial — implementation of content restrictions took down a swathe of non-news publishers’ Facebook pages, as well as silencing news outlets’, illustrating its planned dodge of the (future) law.
- Facebook took the step to censor a bunch of pages as parliamentarians in Australia are debating a legislative proposal to force Facebook (and Google) to pay publishers for linking to their news content. In recent years the media industry in the country has successfully lobbied for a law to extract payment from the tech giants for monetizing news content when it’s reshared on their platforms — though the legislation is still being drafted.
- Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for news
- 
- Last month Google also threatened to close its search engine in Australia if the law isn’t amended. But it’s Facebook that screwed its courage to the sticking place and flipped the chaos switch first.
- Last night internet users in Australia took to Twitter to report local scores of Facebook pages being wiped clean of content — including hospitals, universities, unions, government departments and the bureau of meteorology, to name a few.

- 
- In the wake of Facebook’s unilateral censorship of all sorts of Facebook pages, parliamentarians in the country accused the tech giant of “an assault on a sovereign nation”.
- The prime minister of Australia also said today that his government “would not be intimidated”.
- Reached for comment, Facebook confirmed it has applied an intentionally broad definition of news to restrict — saying it has done so to reflect the lack of clear guidance in the law “as drafted”.
- So it looks like the collateral damage of Facebook silencing scores of public information pages is at least partly a PR tactic to illustrate potential “consequences” of lawmakers forcing it to pay to display certain types of content — i.e. to “encourage” a rethink while there’s still time.
- The tech giant did also say it would reverse pages that are “inadvertently impacted”.
- But it did not indicate whether it would be doing the leg work of checking its own homework there, or whether silenced pages must (somehow) petition it to be reinstated.
- “The actions we’re taking are focused on restricting publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content. As the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted. However, we will reverse any Pages that are inadvertently impacted,” a Facebook company spokesperson said in the statement.
- It’s also not clear how many non-news pages have been affected by Facebook’s self-imposed content restrictions.
- If the tech giant was hoping to kick off a wider debate about the merits of Australia’s (controversial) plan to make tech pay for news (including in its current guise, for links to news — not just snippets of content, as under the EU’s recent copyright reform expansion of neighbouring rights for news) — Facebook has certainly succeeded in grabbing global eyeballs by blocking regional access to vast swathes of useful, factual information.
- However, Facebook’s blunt action has also attracted criticism that it’s putting business interests before human rights — given it’s shuttering users’ ability to find what might be vital information, such as from hospitals and government departments, in the middle of a pandemic. (Albeit, being accused of ignoring human rights is hardly a new look for Facebook.)
- The Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff’s academic critique of surveillance capitalism — including that it engages in propagating “epistemic chaos” for profit — has perhaps never felt quite so on the nose. (“We turned to Facebook in search of information. Instead we found lethal strategies of epistemic chaos for profit,” she wrote only last month.)
- Facebook’s intentional over-flex has also underscored the vast power of its social monopoly — which will likely only strengthen calls for policymakers and antitrust regulators everywhere to grasp the nettle and rein in big tech. So its local lobbying effort may backfire on the global stage if it further sours public opinion against the scandal-hit company.
- With Facebook deplatforming all news en masse, this is a good time to scrutinise the way platforms can and do take advantage of their monopoly position as ubiquitous / essential intermediaries in people's lives to throw their weight around. As Culpepper and Thelen (2019) put it: pic.twitter.com/cPvrdjEWpx
- — Jathan Sadowski (@jathansadowski) February 17, 2021
- 
- Facebook’s rush to censor may even encourage a proportion of its users to remember/discover that there’s a whole open internet outside its walled garden — where they can freely access public information without having to log into Facebook’s ad-targeting platform (and be stripped of their privacy) first.
- As others have noted, it’s also interesting to note how quickly Facebook can pull the content moderation trigger when it believes its bottom line is threatened. And a law to extract payment for sharing news content presents a clear threat.
- Compare and contrast Facebook’s rush to silence information pages in Australia with its laid back approach to tackling outrage-inducing hate speech or violent conspiracy nonsense and it’s hard not to conclude that content moderation on (and by) Facebook is always viewed through the prism of Facebook’s global revenue growth goals. (Much like how the tech giant can here be seen in a court filing chainlinking revenue to its self-reported ad metric tools.)
- Facebook restricts users in Australia from sharing or viewing news links
- 
- Google and Facebook must pay media for content reuse, says Australia

- In this article
- Facebook has reached an agreement with the Australian government and will restore news pages in the country days after restricting them.
- The decision follows negotiations between the tech giant and the Australian government, which is set to pass a new media law that will require digital platforms to pay for news.
- "After further discussions, we are satisfied that the Australian government has agreed to a number of changes and guarantees that address our core concerns about allowing commercial deals that recognize the value our platform provides to publishers relative to the value we receive from them," Facebook said in an updated statement.
- "As a result of these changes, we can now work to further our investment in public interest journalism and restore news on Facebook for Australians in the coming days," the company said.
- Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government introduced last-minute changes to the proposed news media bargaining code that is in parliament and is expected to be voted into law soon. The bill was introduced in parliament last December.
- The law, if passed, will make digital platforms pay local media outlets and publishers to link their content in news feeds or search results.
- Under the amendments to the proposed bill, the Australian government will take into account commercial agreements that digital platforms like Google and Facebook have already made with local news media businesses before deciding if the code applies to the tech giants.
- The government will also give the digital platforms one month's notice before reaching the final decision.
- It will also include a two-month mediation period to allow digital platforms and publishers to broker deals before they are made to enter arbitration as a last resort.
- The arbitration clause has been one of Facebook's main points of objection.
- The bill says that if both sides are unable to reach a commercial deal, then government-appointed arbitrators can decide on the final price by ruling in favor of either party — the digital platform or the publisher — with no room for a middle-ground agreement, according to experts.
- Tuesday's amendments are expected to provide "further clarity" to digital platforms and news organizations on how the bargaining code will be implemented, the government said.
- It would also "add further impetus for parties to engage in commercial negotiations" outside the media bargaining code, the government added.
- Seven West Media, which owns the Australian broadcast network Seven, said Tuesday it signed a letter of intent to provide news content to Facebook. It also signed a similar agreement with Google this month.
- Both Google and Facebook have fought against the media law since last year.
- Google previously threatened to remove its search service from Australia in response to the proposed law. But the company has since struck commercial deals with local publishers including the Murdoch family-owned media conglomerate News Corp.
- Facebook, for its part, followed through with a threat to remove news features from Australia.
- Last week, the company said Australian users would not be able to view or share news content while international users would not be able to access Australian news content on its platform. The move faced backlash from politicians as well as users, after important government health and emergency pages on Facebook were blocked.
- Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he had been in contact with Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg as both parties worked to resolve issues around the law.
- Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice president for global news partnership, said Tuesday that the Australian government clarified that the company will retain the ability to decide if news appears on its platform so that it won't automatically be subject to a forced negotiation.
- "We'll continue to invest in news globally and resist efforts by media conglomerates to advance regulatory frameworks that do not take account of the true value exchange between publishers and platforms like Facebook," Brown said.

- By  Jon Porter, a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards.
- When Facebook briefly blocked all news from being posted on its platform in Australia last year, it used an overly broad definition of news publisher that it knew would cause collateral damage, company whistleblowers are alleging. Complaints filed with Australia’s Competition & Consumer Commission and the US Department of Justice allege that the company engaged in “a criminal conspiracy to obtain a thing of value, namely favorable regulatory treatment,” The Wall Street Journal reports.
- The news ban was put into place by Facebook last February in protest over a proposed Australian law that would effectively force platform-holders like it and Google to pay news publishers when sharing their content. But the ban was chaotically implemented, and there were widespread reports of it blocking government organizations and nonprofits alongside news publishers.
- The law eventually passed in an amended form
- Blocked non-media pages included government organizations like the Department of Fire and Emergency Services Western Australia and Queensland Health and nonprofits like Mission Australia and the Hobart Woman’s shelter. The ban took place during fire season in Australia, the WSJ notes, and coincided with the country’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout. In total, the WSJ reports that Facebook internally recognized it had blocked 17,000 pages that it shouldn’t have in the first day of the ban.
- “It was clear this was not us complying with the law, but a hit on civic institutions and emergency services in Australia,” one whistleblower said, in comments reported by the WSJ. Facebook started removing the pages on February 18th, after the House of Representatives passed an initial version of the bill, but ahead of final votes by it and the Australian Senate the following week.
- Facebook publicly admitted at the time that it had taken a “broad definition” of news content, in light of what it said was a lack of “clear guidance” in the law. Records of internal conversations obtained by the WSJ offer more evidence that this was the case. “[The proposed Australian law] we are responding to is extremely broad, so guidance from the policy and legal team has been to be overinclusive and refine as we get more information,” wrote a product manager in an internal log.
- Leaked documents suggest the company classified a page a news publisher if over 60 percent of the content it shared was classified as news. Documents also suggest that the company had planned on excluding all government and education domains from the ban.
- But the list of organizations who saw their Facebook pages removed as a result of the ban suggests these safeguards malfunctioned, and according to the WSJ, Facebook ignored approaches that could have more precisely targeted news organizations. The company decided against using its database of news publishers known as the News Page Index, apparently because it relied on news publishers to opt-in, and the complaints allege it failed to use existing whitelisting tools to protect important accounts. It failed to put an appeals process in place before blocking pages, and did not notify affected pages in advance.
- Despite the technical issues with the media ban, Facebook officials internally praised the company’s response to the legislation. Facebook’s head of partnerships Campbell Brown called the team’s efforts “genius,” while chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said “the thoughtfulness of the strategy, precision of execution, and ability to stay nimble as things evolved [set] a new high-standard.” CEO Mark Zuckerberg praised the team’s ability to “execute quickly and take a principled approach.”
- When reached for comment, Facebook spokesperson Gina Murphy sent over a statement saying “the documents in question clearly show that we intended to exempt Australian government Pages from restrictions in an effort to minimize the impact of this misguided and harmful legislation. When we were unable to do so as intended due to a technical error, we apologized and worked to correct it. Any suggestion to the contrary is categorically and obviously false.”
- The law Facebook was protesting went on to pass later that month. But it did so while containing amended language that means the Australian Treasurer needs to consider private deals struck between publishers and platforms before designating a company like Facebook as a platform under the law, and allowing it to be forced into arbitration. As a result, over a year after the law passed, neither Facebook nor Google have officially been designated as platforms under the rules.
