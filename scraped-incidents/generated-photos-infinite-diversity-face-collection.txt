- Generated Photos is a collection of 100,000 free images of AI-generated faces to help designers who need portraits for their websites, apps or presentations. It launched in September 2019 to a mixed reception.
- The collection features headshots with consistent lighting and sizing with a wide range of angles, positions, and facial expressions, reflecting a wide variety of ethnicities, ages and face shapes to represent an 'infinite diversity.'
- A large number of users praised the collection for the 'realism' and usefulness of the photos. But some described the photos as 'weird', 'stiff' and, in some instances, 'truly fucked up'.
- Others pointed out the ease with which they could be used for malicious purposes, and that they could put licensed stock photo companies and models out of business.
- In a blog post, Generated Photos developer Icon8 said the company used real models to create the 'incredibly realistic' images rather than scraping from the web or using stock photographs, thereby getting round copyright issues.

- A startup thinks it can solve diversity issues in stock imagery by replacing real people with algorithmically-generated portraits of people who don't exist.
- Generated Photos, a collection of 100,000 images of AI-generated faces, is owned by Icons8, a company that makes stock icons and illustrations for designers. According to the company, all of the portraits are free for anyone to use and accessible in a Google Drive link as long as users link back to generated.photos whenever the images are used.
- According to a blog post by Icons8, the company took the training images (AI generates new images after “learning” from a pool of “training” data) in-house using real models, and none of the training images were pulled from existing stock media or scraped from the internet without consent.
- The portraits Icons8 chose to feature on the Generated Photos website are weirdly poreless and stiff—the telltale signs of algorithmic generation. Still, they're no less stiff or weird than traditional stock imagery of, say, a woman eating salad and deliriously laughing.
- But many of the 100,000 images found within the database itself are truly fucked up. Some have random eye sockets on their foreheads, or chins that melt into the background. Engineers still haven't perfected a method of generating fake faces that escape the uncanny valley. If an algorithm doesn't have enough source images or time to train—or just because of the quirks in AI models—it can leave artifacts like a hole in the head.
- The available information on the Generated Photos website doesn't disclose the demographic makeup of the models whose images were used for training or any details on the dataset or system itself. Icons8 did not respond to a request for comment.
- "So, the resource lets creators fill their creative projects with beautiful photos of people that will never take their time and money in real life," Icons8 wrote in the blog post. The company says that it's "creating a simple API that can produce infinite diversity."
- Its website previews a user interface that allows designers to filter the fake people into categories based on skin tone, ethnicity, age, and gender—alongside an image of a grinning blonde white woman.
- "Generally, I raise my eyebrows at anything as 'infinite diversity,'" machine learning designer Caroline Sinders, a fellow with Mozilla Foundation and the Harvard Kennedy School who studies biases in AI systems, told Motherboard.
- "Who is determining or defining that? Are their definition or parameters open to audit? Can they be changed? What is their process for ensuring infinite diversity?” she said “On [the] one hand, it is better to have a database full of images that are not real people—that doesn't violate anyone's consent. But what are those data sets used for? And who benefits from those systems? We need to ask that as well."
- Implying that a lack of diversity can be "fixed" with an algorithm is dubious. Machine learning models are the product of human labor, whether it's an engineer coding an algorithm or Mechanical Turk workers being paid literal pennies to identify objects that help train an AI. Their human biases and prejudices are often baked into their software.
- The AI research community is struggling with a lack of diversity from the people who makes these systems; Findings published by the AI Now Institute earlier this year said the machine learning industry is experiencing a "diversity disaster," with systems built mostly by men. As for how this has turned out so far, one example: In 2018, Amazon pulled the plug on its own hiring AI, after it found that the system was biased against female applicants.
- Computer-generated humans, and CGI influencers in particular, are having a moment—and are similarly under fire for attempting to achieve some idea of diversity while not actually engaging or compensating people of color. "Shudu Gram," a CGI model as seen on Fenty Beauty's Instagram, is the creation of a white man—and has been criticized for profiting off of her representation of diversity. He calls her his "expression of creativity."
- Another issue raised by the Generated Photos project is that of fake accounts on social media, and the ease with which people can make bot, spam, or catfishing profiles using algorithmically-generated images. Earlier this year, spies used AI portraits to make connections with high-powered government officials.
- Instead of “infinite diversity,” AI is giving us an infinitely expanding set of conundrums to navigate. But if you want to use diverse and ethically-made stock images, you can download them from a place like culturally-diverse stock image company TONL, or Vice's Gender Spectrum Collection image library.

- By  Jon Porter, a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards.
- It’s getting easier and easier to use AI to generate convincing-looking, yet entirely fake, pictures of people. Now, one company wants to find a use for these photos, by offering a resource of 100,000 AI-generated faces to anyone that can use them — royalty free. Many of the images look fake but others are difficult to distinguish from images licensed by stock photo companies.
- The project’s Product Hunt page lists the team at Icons8, a designer marketplace for icons and photographs, as the creator of the project. The AI-produced images are intended to be used as design elements in anything from presentations to websites and mobile apps. Everything is free to use with link attribution back to generated.photos.
- Over the course of the year, we’ve seen a number of AI projects generate fake AI faces, most notably ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com, a website capable of producing an infinite series of mostly-believable headshots. The faces found on generated.photos cover a variety of ages, shapes, and ethnicities, and they’re all consistently lit and consistently sized to make them useful for designers.
- The project is currently in its early stages, and Icons8 product designer Konstantin Zhabinskiy notes that some of the faces might look a bit “off.” You can see some examples of this in the images above where the AI has produced a mangled hand and background in one image, and given another fake model a wound to their forehead. However, the team’s hope is to eventually produce a simple API that can easily generate new photographs based on a variety of inputs, allowing designers to quickly produce photorealistic images to illustrate their work without having to worry about copyright or model releases.
- Zhabinskiy is keen to emphasize that the AI used to generate these images was trained using data shot in-house, rather than using stock media or scraping photographs from the internet. “Such an approach requires thousands of hours of labor, but in the end, it will certainly be worth it!” exclaims an Icons8 blog post. Ivan Braun, the founder of Icons8, says that in total the team took 29,000 pictures of 69 models over the course of three years which it used to train its algorithm.
- There are valid concerns about technology that’s able to generate convincing-looking fakes like these at scale. This project is trying to create images that make life easier for designers, but the software could one day be used for all sorts of malicious activity.
- Update September 20th, 1:00PM ET: Updated with additional details from Icons8 founder Ivan Braun about the amount of photos used to train the algorithm.

- The world is very familiar with the booming industry of next-generation technologies such as artificial intelligence as well as with the pros and cons of their uses. Recently a website has shared some AI-generated images which not only stunned many internet users but also raised concern over such unique creation.
- There is no denying that such technologies are spreading all over the world. But people cannot overlook the dark side of using these technologies, especially the growing fear that Deepfake contents are becoming so realistic that innocent people are at risk of going behind the bars, claims experts.
- In this recent case, the website, called Generated Photos, have shared 100,000 AI-generated headshots with an aim to build the next generation of media through the power of AI. Generated by their internal AI systems, these pictures, which look like the images of real humans can be found on the website.
- As described by the website, "Copyrights, distribution rights, and infringement claims will soon be things of the past."
- It is also mentioned that they created a free resource of 100,000 AI created high-quality images to make all the internet users understand, what the team members have been working on and in return, they just want credit.
- "Use them in your presentations, projects, mockups or wherever â€” all for just a link back to us!" the website wrote.
- After seeing these images which were posted as a promotional advertisement on the YouTube channel of Generated Photos, many users said that they could put licensed stock photo companies and models out of business.
- In YouTube, the designers stated in the description section that they are currently working to "train and refine our generative models toward our ultimate goal: creating a simple API that can produce infinite diversity."
- "We are iterating fast, but things aren't perfect quite yet. When you see a face that is a bit 'off', just give it some slack."
- As per their claims, these headshots features consistent lighting, consistent sizing, range of angles, positions, range of facial expressions, a wide variety of ethnicities, all ages and all face shapes.
- Even though most of the images look so real, there are some pictures where the AI had glitched around the forehead region and left a futuristic wound, some of the models just look wrapped and there are people with limbs around their faces.
- The team behind this unique project aims to create AI that can easily generate convincing pictures of humans based on just a few inputs.
- The website details have claimed that these AI-generated faced would be perfect for:
- "This work isn't just a one-off novelty. We are building an entire toolset that will let anyone harness the creative power of AI as easily as integrating an API," mentioned Generated Photos.

- Update: the Generated Photos platform has now launched, for the latest information please visit our official FAQ.
- Thanks for the interest in Generated Photos! We know you have many questions about who we are and what we are building; let us clear those up.
- Looking for example photos from the 100k Faces project? Visit our press page.
- We are democratizing creative photography and video. We aim to make creative works both more accessible and higher quality through generative processes.
- We are a team of about 20 AI and photography professionals.
- The founder is Ivan Braun.
- Generated Media, Inc. is a fully distributed company (incorporated in the USA). We have been remote-first from day one and now have employees representing six countries and counting!
- Contact us anytime at work.with@generated.photos.
- We have built an original machine learning dataset, and used StyleGAN (an amazing resource by NVIDIA) to construct a realistic set of 100,000 faces.
- Dataset Creation
- Our dataset has been built by taking 29,000+ photos of 69 different models over the last 2 years in our studio. We took these photos in a controlled environment (similar lighting and post-processing) to make sure that each face had consistent high output quality. After shooting, we underwent labor-intensive tasks such as tagging and categorizing.
- Software Development
- *We plan to write more about how we accomplished this task in greater detail!
- Generating media can definitely come out weird at times! Some faces will have strange ‘stuff’ in the background, while others just seem slightly off for no apparent reason. For example, we have noted a common issue with something that looks like a crater appearing in random places. Those familiar with generative adversarial networks have likely seen worse. Our whole process is designed to gradually improve the final results and we are far from done yet! We find these stages of growth quite fascinating. Take a look at this early sample to see where we started:
- We’re currently busy behind the scenes selecting out the highest-quality generated images. It’s a relatively simple classification task, but it does take time; you’ll see more from us soon!
- After running a studio for the last 2 years, we have learned it can be difficult to find interesting, diverse models that are also willing to shoot stock photography. We are fascinated by the range of personalities we have captured so far and will continue to push that envelope going forward.
- Yes! They are can all be used for free as long as a link back to generated.photos is placed on the page, post, or project. Currently, faces made available for the 100,000 faces project are available for non-commercial use only.
- Update (Dec ‘19): Licensed commercial use of AI-generated faces is now available, please visit Generated Photos for more information.
- The most notable errors occur in places that lack adequate training data. Pay special attention to images of uncommon events or poses. Items that can vary greatly such as clothing, hairstyles, or accessories are also especially difficult to realistically generate. For photos of faces particularly note:
- Specifying images as generated in situations where there are legal or ethical concerns is perfectly reasonable.
- The reality of the current situation is that we may safely assume virtually any image has been photoshopped, beauty-filtered, generated, or otherwise manipulated. Even an out-of-the-box iPhone makes skin look like a barrel of silicone foundation!
- Regardless of the process used to modify an image, we (society) need a technology that certifies an image has remained unchanged. Crime scene photography, product shots, passport photos — we need a technology that confirms the final shot is the result of the light passing through a lens, without any manipulation.
- In short: media will change forever.
- Conventional beauty is changing. Our systems don’t understand or care about a created person being ‘beautiful’ or ‘ugly’. They care about whether a person looks human or not. With generative media, it is possible to build any combination of physical attributes. We will no longer have to rely on a few supermodels to represent the standards for the entire world.
- Generative media is not all ‘fakes’. The same technology used to generate random unreal people can also be used to recreate people from the real world.
- Imagine Netflix being able to synthesize your family members so that they can have small parts in their next hit series. People and situations from your life will be used to deepen your connection to media. We believe that technology is not far off. While it does open the door to a myriad of potential situations, we believe that the benefits from generation vastly outweigh the potential issues.
- Why should we dream of meeting someone we don’t know? Why don’t we dream of meeting our family the same way? What if watching a movie suddenly seemed incredibly personal? These are the types of questions we are working to answer.
- A lack of resources often prevents newcomers from entering the media industry. You can’t produce a Netflix show without Netflix money. With generative media, a single creative person can create a whole movie just sitting at their computer. This opens up markets across the world to producing content that would previously have been impossible.
- We will not produce documentary photography or video.
- News footage must be documental, as does a family archive or a photo from a scene of a crime.
- Generative media must be kept independent from documentary media. We encourage technology to be built that certifies authenticity — a rubber stamp analog for the 21st century.

- Этот материал был удалён по просьбе автора.
- Все это выглядит очень неплохо, но не могу придумать реально выгодного применения дальше, чем для сервиса ботоводов в образной телеге.
- Кейс, описанный в статье, - норм, но много денег вряд ли принесет. Но самому очень интересно, какие еще могут быть варианты.
- Привет, я — основатель. Хороший вопрос, который часто задают журналисты (Washington Post, BBC, New York Times, etc.)
- В основном — это датасеты для машинного обучения. Сложно создать _сбалансированный_ датасет, где одновременно:
* 50% взрослых, 25% детей, 25% стариков
* По столько-то процентов разных национальностей
* По столько-то процентов эмоций, итд.
- Мы это можем и продаем большим компаниям, которые у всех на слуху: https://generated.photos/datasets
- Кроме того, их используют для исследований. Например, один университет в Техасе показывает разные лица с разными утверждениями и выясняет, какие из лиц вызывают доверие.
- Еще для игр и дизайна, особенно для всяких стыдных медицинских диагнозов. Вот некоторые иллюстрации: https://generated.photos/use-cases
- PS Спасибо, что вы не как комментаторы на mail.ru :) https://www.facebook.com/ivan.braunn/posts/10158157458572773
- PPS АМА - отвечу на вопросы
- привет! Отличные кейсы, спасибо!
- Здравствуйте, было бы замечательно иметь возможность остановится на каком либо портрете и сделать генерацию изображений  разных ракурсов, разных выражений лица.
- В очень недалеком будущем это будет незаменимый проект. Ждем с нетерпением дальнейшего развития.
- Это — самая ожидаемая фича. Делаем и скоро зарелизим.
- Игры, обучалки. Любое, где есть персонажи. 
В каком-нибудь кино, типа преступников и пострадавших. На всяких стоках, где есть авторские права. Но тут нужны ситуации, позы и эмоции.
- Дада, точно! Поэтому и делаем https://icons8.com/photos и https://icons8.com/creator — хотим сделать фотошоп, где можно не только обрабатывать, но и заново "рисовать" фотографии.
- Вот, накидал демку:
- Если научаться тела делать и эти тела смогут  какие-то сценки разыгрывать, то будет крутейший фотосток
- Обожаю практиков. Спасибо!
- Да, к этому и движемся: вот, наснимли https://icons8.com/photos и хотим им фейс своп сделать хорошо (в хорошем разрешении и без артефактов). Уже полгода плотно обучаем модель.
- (https://icons8.com/photos/photo/man-holding-a-paper-bag-over-his-shoulder--5d0bc977dad7fc000190902f)
- Описание тоже AI сгенерировано. Все еще учится
- Похоже, Гачимучи был в сете на обучении. :-)
- Потом это попадёт всё в инстраграм. Скорее всего будет популярен сервис у тех кто делает очень похожие фото в соц сетях и имеют большую базу подписчиков. Утром встал, кое налил. Сгенерировал пару фото и выкинул в течении дня, ни каких фото сессий,подбора места и тд. А потом может быть депрессия от того что скрипт программы живёт лучше чем сам человек....  Хотя он то не живёт
- Дада ) Я думаю, что так и будет, и это будет маленькой ступенькой в визуальных технологиях, не первой и не последней.
- До цифровых фото люди думали: вот скоро будущее наступит: не надо будет проявитель разводить, фиксаж, ванночки эти, глянцеватели!
- А до этого и фотографии не было, надо было маслом писать. Да что там, масло — большой скачок в удобстве по сравнению с темперой, которая быстро сохнет и нельзя поверх замазать.
- Так и генеративные медиа будут одним из удобных инструментов наряду с фотошопом или плоской кистью.
- (Чувствую, что получается длинно и назидательно)
- К чему это: техника меняется, но выразительные средства всегда идут по одному пути: 
1. Модернизм: мы пробуем то, что дает технология. Генеративные медиа сейчас здесь. 
2. Зрелость: вырабатываются каноны, техники, налаживается системное образование. В конце концов все становится чинным и элегантным.
3. Модернизм: все чинное и стерильное и хочется дичи.
- Вспомните веб-дизайн:
1. Дизайнеры были в восторге от таблиц, гифок и джаваскрипта. Комический дизайн середины 90-х!
2. Корпоративный лук а-ля Salesforce. 
3. Брутализм, zine, лиловые градиенты. Вон, кто-то шапку розовую сделал 👆
- Плохо что человек с каждой новой технологией всё дальше прячет себя реального от мира.Не думаю что раньше так сильно заморачивались с коррекцией картин,как сейчас с фотографией. Представил как Мона Лиза просит Леонардо  подтянуть лицо,убрать морщины,мешки под глазами,сделать носик чуть уже
- Да художники и сами рады были стараться, жрать-то надо. Вон, румяный, в черном платье (дорогой краситель), с кружевами.
- А потом вас купит фэйсбук за миллиард ;). он любит покупать стартапы за миллиард )))

- Ага, там у классификатора параметр мужественности от 0 до 1. Делим пополам, но те у кого в районе 0.5 обладают и мужскими, и женскими чертами. Как вариант, их можно выделять в Other или Non-binary.

- Ну это косоглазие — у меня тоже такое было до операции. Вы погуглите weird mugshot — вот где удивительные, нереальные, неземные люди!
- Здесь даже Дартмолл есть без грима....
- Как-то сыро. И не хватает обычного бесплатного доступа без регистрации хотя бы до 100-200 лиц в месяц. Лица, кстати, какие-то похожие друг на друга, как будто исходник один. Многие с косыми или прикрытыми глазами.
- Так берите прямо со страницы, только ссылку поставьте.
- Исходник да, один - наша студия фотографии.
- Косых и прикрытых просьба помечать пальцем вниз. Их изначльно довольно много генерируется, но мы их вычищаем отдельными ML-алгоритмами.
- Дали на ваш проект ссылочку в телеграм канале о презентациях Power Point. Ещё одно из применений вашей программы. :) https://t.me/PowerPointPresentation
- Воот, кстати! А еще там неточность: можно гонять бесплатно за ссылку.
- "чтобы водить людей в заблуждение и убедительно врать" ))
ну рили, в 90% случаев так и будет.
игры гораздо реже...
- Здравствуйте, я новичок и ничего здесь не понимаю. Объясните пожалуйста куда мне нужно зайти чтобы, создать свою фотографию. Буду очень благодарна.
