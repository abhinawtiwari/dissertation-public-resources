- 
- Nio Inc. (Chinese: 蔚来; pinyin: Wèilái; stylised as NIO) is a Chinese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Shanghai, specializing in designing and developing electric vehicles. The company develops battery-swapping stations for its vehicles, as an alternative to conventional charging stations.[4] The company has raised over $5 billions from investors. In 2021, Nio plans to expand to 25 different countries and regions by 2025. [5]
- After the brand launch in the Saatchi Gallery in London in 2016, several companies invested in Nio, including Tencent, Temasek, Sequoia, Lenovo and TPG. Its first model, the Nio EP9 sports car, debuted the same day the brand was established.
- In October 2016, Nio announced that it had been given an "Autonomous Vehicle Testing Permit" by the California DMV and it would begin testing on public roads under the "Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program" guidelines as part of its autonomous vehicle program. According to the company, it planned to launch vehicles with level-three and level-four autonomy.[6]
- In May 2018, Nio opened its first battery swap station in the Nanshan District of Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, dubbed the "Power Swap Station".[7] Only batteries for ES8 cars would be available from this station.[8]
- In September 2018, the company filed for a US$1.8 billion initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.[9]
- In late April 2020, Nio announced approximately US$1 billion in new funding from a group of Chinese investors,[10] which was needed due to the company's struggles to sell its vehicles.[11] As part of the deal, Nio would transfer assets to a new subsidiary called Nio China, which will be headquartered in Hefei.[12]
- In August 2020, Nio launched Battery as a Service (BaaS) and formed a battery asset management company in collaboration with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited ("CATL"), Hubei Science Technology Investment Group Co., Ltd. and a subsidiary of Guotai Junan International Holdings Limited. Each contributing roughly US$31.6 million (CN¥200 million) into the venture, for 25% equity. BaaS helps lower the purchase price of Nio electric vehicles by about 25%.[13]
- In May 2021, Nio announced a Norway expansion plan, saying it would begin delivering cars to Norway by September 2021.[14] In the third quarter of 2021, Nio delivered 24,439 ES8, ES6, and EC6, a new quarterly record representing a growth of 100.2% year over year.[15]
- At Nio Day in December 2021, Nio announced it would bring its User Enterprise to Germany, Denmark, Netherlands and Sweden in 2022.[1]
- On 22 February 2022, it was announced that Nio is planning to venture into China's smartphone market and preparing to make its own handsets. The company has formed a smartphone division in Shenzhen, and is hiring staff to expand the team. The move is preceded by similar plans to manufacture smartphones by automakers Geely and Volvo.[16]
- Nio's first car was the EP9 electric hypercar, presented the same day the brand was launched.[17] Nio revealed the ES8, a seven-seater electric SUV in December 2017 and began deliveries of the ES8 in June 2018. Nio launched the ES6, a five-seater electric SUV, in December 2018, and began deliveries in June 2019. In December 2019, Nio launched the EC6, a five-seater electric coupe SUV with deliveries beginning in September 2020. Nio launched ET7, its electric sedan, in January 2021 and revealed ET5, its most compact sedan at Nio Day in December 2021.[18]
- To date, Nio has revealed two concept cars; EVE at SXSW 2017 and ET Preview at Auto Shanghai 2019.[19][20]

- Nio's battery swap stations allow owners to upgrade the capacity of their battery packs, either temporarily or permanently. These battery swapping stations have a reported swapping time of under five minutes.[23]
- Unlike Tesla, which has tried battery swapping but has never deployed it on a large scale and relies instead on its Supercharger network, Nio has built a functioning network of 1,305 battery-swap stations that covers several thousand kilometres of Chinese expressways.[24]
- The first phase was installing 18 battery-swap stations in 14 different locations along the G4 expressway, a 2,273-kilometre-long (1,412 mi) road connecting Beijing (the national capital) with the Pearl River Delta (world's largest urban area[25] where Hong Kong and Shenzhen are located). This was completed in November 2018.[26]
- The second phase consisted of installing battery-swap stations in 8 locations along the G2 expressway, a 1,212-kilometre-long (753 mi) road connecting Beijing with Shanghai. This phase was completed in January 2019.[27]
- On 24 March 2021, Nio completed its 2 millionth battery swap in the city of Suzhou. It has also deployed 193 battery swapping stations, 134 supercharging stations, and 327 destination stations across China.[28]
- On 10 December 2021, Nio installed its 700th battery swap station in China, hitting its annual target ahead of schedule, Nio's second-generation battery swap station allows the vehicle to automatically park into the station, with which users can experience a three-minute battery swap while staying inside the vehicle. So far, Nio has provided over 5.3 million swaps to users in China. Battery swapping has become one of the favourite power solutions among Nio users.[29]
- As of May 2022, Nio has opened its first swap station in Europe, located in Norway, with plans to expand in other cities.[30]
- As of December 31 2022, Nio built 1,305 battery swap stations over all provincial administrative regions in China. Nio currently provides an average of 40,000 battery swap services today, and a total of 15 million battery swap services.[31]
- NOMI[32] is Nio's digital assistant for the car dashboard to provide a closer engagement with its drivers and passengers and Nio claims is the world's first in-car  AI system for production vehicles.
- The NOMI Mate 2.0 features a circular AMOLED[33] display and incorporates artificial intelligence with a human face-like interface that swivels and blinks its oval ‘eyes’ to address each vehicle occupant directly, depending on their location.
- NOMI learns user preferences over time to understand the specific context of the car in relation to its owner. For example, NOMI can set the personal seating and steering wheel positions whenever it senses a driver approaching the vehicle. Users can also give NOMI verbal commands to adjust the cabin temperature, open or close windows, or snap an in-car selfie and have it displayed on the radio screen.[34]
- Nio Pilot is the company's SAE level 2 semi-autonomous system that offers ADAS features. It launched with the introduction of Nio's ES8 model. Several over the air updates throughout 2018 and 2019 has enhanced Nio Pilot with features such as lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, automatic emergency braking, highway pilot (Nio Navigate on Pilot, NNOP), traffic Jam assistance, auto lane change and more.[35]
- Nio Pilot sensor suite consists of 23 sensors, including a trifocal forward camera, 5 radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors and a driver monitor camera.[36] Nio was the first automaker to launch a car model utilizing Mobileye's EyeQ4 vision chip.[37]
- In August 2021, Lin Wenqin, a 31-year-old Chinese man, was killed after his Nio ES8 collided with a construction vehicle.[38] Nio's self-driving feature was still in beta, and could not deal with static obstacles.[39] Though the vehicle's manual at the time clearly stated that the driver must take over when nearing construction sites, there was an issue regarding whether the feature was improperly marketed and unsafe. Lawyers of the family of the person killed  called into question Nio's private access to the vehicle, which they argue could lead to the data being falsified.[40]
- In November 2019, Nio announced a partnership with Mobileye to develop a consumer car equipped with Mobileye's complete Level 4 self-driving system called Aquila that could be sold to consumers by 2022.[41] Aquila features 33 sensors, including 11 high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, 5 radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and two high-precision positioning units: V2X and ADMS.[42]
- The system was first on board of the Nio ET7.[43] The company begun deliveries of the model in Q1 of 2022.[44]
- The new Nio Adam supercomputer is one of the most powerful platforms to run in a vehicle. With four NVIDIA DRIVE Orin processors, Adam achieves more than 1,000 TOPS of performance.[45] All of Nio’s NT 2.0 platform vehicles — such as the ET7, ET5, ES7, EC7, 2nd Gen ES8 — are built on the Nio Adam supercomputer, with four NVIDIA DRIVE Orinsystems-on-a-chip (SoC) at its core.[46]
- On April 7, 2021, NIO produced its 100,000th electric vehicle.[47]
- On April 26, 2022, NIO announced its 200,000th electric car rolling off the production line.[48]
- On December 12, 2022, NIO announced it's 300,000 electric car rolling off the production line.[49]
- Nio Life is the company's design lifestyle brand. The brand launched in 2018 with a capsule collection made in collaboration with Hussein Chalayan.[50] In 2021 Nio Life launched its sustainable fashion label "Blue Sky Lab".[51] The label collaborated with the Parsons School of Design challenging students to create new products made of leftover car manufacturer materials and, thereby, providing opportunities for young designers.[52]
- Nio Service is the company's network of service centers.[53] Nio Users can request a "pick-up-and-delivery" service for their car to the service center. Additionally, mobile service vehicles can carry out simple maintenance work on demand.[54]
- Nio Power is the company's network of battery swap stations, power mobile, power home and super chargers. Nio has 1,305 swap Stations around China as of December 31, 2022, including 346 battery swap stations along highways.[2] In addition to the 1,305 battery swap stations, Nio has 1,223 supercharging stations in China and 1,058 destination charging stations.

- The Nio team is one of the original Formula E teams, originally competing under the name Team China Racing.[64] Before the first season was completed, they rebranded as NEXTEV TCR. In this inaugural season, their main driver Nelson Piquet Jr. became the FIA Formula E Driver's Champion, after winning two races in Long Beach and Moscow.[65][66] The team was only able to achieve fourth in the constructor's championship though, in part due to a rotating line-up of second drivers that didn't achieve as consistent level of success as Piquet.
- From season 2 onwards, Formula E opened up car development, with teams creating their own powertrains.[67] Nio used their own design NEXTEV powertrain, but it saw a downturn in the team's performance for the constructor's championship, as they finished only 9th in season 2, 6th in season 3 and 8th in season 4. By this point, the team had morphed through NEXTEV, NEXTEV Nio until renamed simply Nio. Season 5 would see the team's meagre successes diminish further, as they languished 11th and last in the championship.
- For season 6 (2019–20) the team was sold on to Lisheng Racing and renamed Nio 333 Racing.[68] For the first time since season 1, Nio did not provide their own powertrain for the car, instead using the previous year's Dragon powertrain. It was rebranded under Nio's name and they remained classified as a manufacturer. This didn't change the team's fortunes, as they would go on to have their worst ever season, with neither Oliver Turvey nor Ma Qinghua being able to score any points in 2020. In season seven Nio improved marginally, as whilst Turvey and new arrival Tom Blomqvist amassed a total of 19 points throughout the campaign, the squad still remained in last place.
- Nio once again changed their driver line-up for the 2021–22 Formula E season, as Blomqvist made way for former Red Bull and Williams junior Dan Ticktum.[69]
- Nio set five records in their track-only EP9 for the fastest lap for an electric-powered car in the Nürburgring Nordschleife, Circuit Paul Ricard, Circuit of the Americas, and Shanghai International Circuit tracks.[70]
- In Sep 2018, Nio listed on NYSE after raising about $1 billion selling American depositary shares at $6.26 apiece. The shares started trading under the symbol NIO.[71]
- In 2018, while Nio was preparing for an IPO, the company told investors that they were building a new factory in Shanghai.[72] Then in March 2019, Nio disclosed that the factory would never be built. According to former employees, construction had never started. Investors sued and accused Nio's promoters, which included Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, of negligence in examining Nio's financial statements.

- Nio is enveloped in a public relations nightmare after Chinese traffic authorities last month disclosed the first known fatality involving one of the company’s vehicles using its partially automated driving system.
- Called Nio Pilot, the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) has been a major selling point for the maker of luxury electric vehicles (EVs). Now it stands accused of overselling the capabilities of the technology. There could be more consequences to come as Nio is in advanced plans to enter the competitive mass auto market.
- The Aug.12 crash of the Nio ES8, resulting in the death of the 31-year-old driver, has also had repercussions throughout the autonomous vehicle industry, with many fearing the prospect of tougher regulation and the loss of public confidence. Xpeng Motors and Li Auto last month quickly dropped the terms “autonomous” and “advanced” in describing their ADAS systems, respectively.
- Drive I/O is TechNode’s ongoing premium series on the cutting edge of mobility: EVs, AVs, and the companies trying to build them. Available to TechNode subscribers.
- The fatal crash: The accident occurred on a highway in Putian city in eastern Fujian province. The driver, Lin Wenqin, had placed his 2020 ES8 into Nio’s Navigate on Pilot mode, which basically takes control of the car during highway driving. The sports utility vehicle struck a highway maintenance vehicle stopped in the same lane, according to a statement (in Chinese) posted by local police on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo on Aug.18. The cause of the crash remains under investigation by Putian city police.
- Shortcomings of ADAS: Pending results of the police investigation, whether the incident was triggered by a software glitch or human error remains an open question. It appears, though, that either Lin or the in-car system failed to recognize the stationary highway car in front of the ES8 and to move to another lane in response.
- Nio’s image in tatters: The deadly incident comes at a crucial time for Nio. Having struggled to gain a foothold in the luxury EV segment, the seven-year-old automaker is pushing to roll out its first mass-market car, eyeing a segment of the market where competition is fierce and margins are thin. Now its hard-won reputation as a high-quality premium brand is under threat.
- Far-reaching consequences: Nio’s user manual warns that the ADAS system cannot detect stationary objects, including “roadblocks,” nor can it brake for them. Drivers are required to take control of their cars immediately when these situations arise. This means the liability for such accidents will probably lie with drivers themselves.
- Xpeng plans foray into the premium market: As Nio moves to the mainstream market, Xpeng Motors is doing the opposite. The Alibaba-backed EV maker, which has maintained a price range between RMB 150,000 ($23,225) and RMB 300,000, is looking to expand in the domestic market by entering the premium-market segment with a high-end model scheduled for release in 2023.
- Internet giants doubling down on self-driving tech: Although the arrival of a truly self-driving car remains delayed indefinitely, Chinese tech giants are still betting heavily on self-driving startups with the intention to own a large share of the driverless driving future. Their investments come at a time when the Chinese government is establishing a looser framework with an expanded scope for testing self-driving vehicles, the South China Morning Post reported.

- A fatal accident involving a Nio ES8 with self-driving tech has sent the Chinese EV maker’s stock into a 5.5% plunge on Monday afternoon.
- The ES8 electric SUV involved in the crash that occurred on August 12 in China was equipped with the Nio Pilot automatic driving assist system powered by Intel's Mobileye EyeQ4. The system uses a trinocular camera, four round-view cameras, five millimeter-wave radars, and twelve ultrasonic sensors.
- Driver Lin Wenqin died after his ES8 SUV, which had Navigate on Pilot (NOP) mode engaged at the time, collided violently with a highway maintenance vehicle on the Shenhai Expressway, in Putian, East China's Fujian Province. The speed limit in that area is 120 km/h (75 mph).
- In the aftermath of the crash, a Beijing-based law firm hired by the family of Lin Wenqin accused Nio of accessing and deleting potentially incriminating vehicle data logs without permission from traffic police. The EV manufacturer replied in a statement that the intervention was only motivated by safety.
- "In order to ensure the battery safety of the car after a high-speed collision, Nio's service personnel on the same day performed a cut-off in the parking lot where the car was parked, but that operation would not cause a data loss."
- Nio also indicated it is cooperating with police in the investigation. This is the second fatal crash involving a Nio vehicle in less than two weeks. On July 30, a Nio EC6 burst into flames in Shanghai after hitting a stone mound on a highway.
- According to information posted on Nio’s website, Navigate on Pilot mode “fuses on-board navigation, HD maps and NIO Pilot to automatically guide the vehicle to follow the navigation route in certain conditions.”
- NOP is said to work on most highways and urban expressways in China, though Nio says in a footnote that “NOP functions better on roads with moderate or low traffic, and is not recommended on heavy-traffic or congested roads.”
- The semi-autonomous driving system can be used in scenarios like merging into traffic, cruising on main roads, navigating interchanges, and taking exits. As with all autonomous driving systems, NOP requires the driver to pay attention to the road and be ready to take over driving at all times.
- Nio stock is down about 16% so far in 2021, although over the past three months shares have gained almost 23% amid strong delivery numbers and fading effects of the global automotive semiconductor shortage.

- The family of Li Wenqin, who was killed in a crash while driving an NIO ES8, has accused NIO of allegedly helping to destroy and falsify evidence, and the case has been accepted by police, Sina Tech said Sunday, citing documents provided by the family.
- The documents show that they provided two pieces of evidence to the police, which have been accepted. One is a video of NIO staff admitting to having private access to the vehicle, and the other is a recording of the NIO staff admitting to having private access to the vehicle, according to the Sina Tech report.
- Lin, the founder of Chinese restaurant brand Meiyihao, died in a traffic accident while driving an NIO ES8 in Fujian earlier this month.
- An obituary released by his company said the ES8 had NOP (Navigation on Pilot) on at the time, putting NIO and the feature into the spotlight.
- Sina Tech on Monday quoted Lin Lihong, a lawyer appointed by Lin's family to represent the case, as saying that the NIO technician had private access to the vehicle in question to operate it without the consent of the traffic police, who had summoned the NIO technician to make a statement.
- If the result of the investigation is that the vehicle data was tampered with or destroyed, the technician will be suspected of a criminal offense, and NIO will be held fully responsible for the accident, the lawyer said.
- NIO later issued a statement denying this, saying that the company did not have any actions to delete data, and no employee was summoned by the police.
- China Securities Journal on August 18 quoted a source from the Putian Expressway Traffic Police Detachment in Fujian Province as saying that no one would be allowed to touch the accident vehicle.
- "We will not allow anyone to touch (the vehicle). (NIO) can find the car, technically it's not difficult at all. The police were not asked to remove all GPS positioning systems after impounding the vehicle," the source said.

- In the wake of a fatal NIO ES8 accident, NIO has begun requiring users to take a test before using the assisted driving feature.
- The NIO App pushed out the NIO Pilot exam to owners on Monday, featuring a six-minute video and ten quiz questions, according to electric vehicle industry forum ddxq.tech.
- 
- The video introduces the key features and things to know about NIO Pilot and re-emphasizes that NIO Pilot and NOP (Navigation on Pilot) are assisted driving features, not autonomous driving and that the driver must always be in control of the driving during use.
- Pilot is an assisted driving feature that helps the driver control the vehicle, cruise adaptively within a set speed, and stay in the lane when the lane lines are clear, the video says.
- The video also details NIO Pilot, how NOP turns on, how to change lanes, how to set range speed, distance, special, high scenario alerts, and inability to respond to road conditions.
- The video repeatedly emphasizes that drivers need to stay focused at all times when using it, and that they need to remind others to watch this video in its entirety when handing over the vehicle to them and confirm that they understand and master the use of NP and the precautions.
- The video was played before the user was answered and rewarded with 200 NIO Credits after all were correct.
- 
- The move makes NIO the latest car company to require users to take a test before using the assisted driving feature.
- One of China's most aggressive companies in the autonomous driving space, NIO's counterpart XPeng introduced an exam system in March this year that requires users to take a test before they can use its NGP (Navigation Guided Pilot) feature.

- NIO owners must watch a video and correctly answer 10 multiple-choice questions
- Following the death of a 31-year-old man who crashed his NIO ES8 while its ‘Navigate on Pilot’ semi-autonomous system was enabled, the electric carmaker has introduced a test that all of its vehicle owners must complete before accessing the driver assistance suite.
- In a bid to prevent other crashes triggered by owners not paying attention while behind the wheel, NIO has rolled out a test available through its smartphone application available to owners. Electrek reports that this test consists of a six-minute video that explains the purpose and abilities of the Navigate on Pilot system, emphasizing that it is an assisted driving feature and does not enable complete autonomous driving.

- In addition, the video reiterates that drivers must remain alert at all times and be ready to take control of the car at a moment’s notice. It then features a 10 multiple-choice questions that users must complete and answer correctly. If they do this, they will receive 200 NIO credits and gain access to the Navigate on Pilot system, which is essentially NIO’s equivalent to Tesla’s Autopilot and GM’s SuperCruise.
- What Happened?
- The incident involving a NIO ES8 which triggered the automaker to implement this test occurred on August 12 and claimed the life of 31-year-old entrepreneur Lin Wenqin. The crash happened while the vehicle’s Navigate on Pilot system was enabled and according to investigations, the ES8 first hit a bucket on the side of the road before slamming into a highway maintenance vehicle, causing the electric SUV to roll multiple times.

- NIO has introduced a new test on its app required for all drivers before unlocking the ability to use Navigate on Pilot (NOP), the company’s assisted driving feature. The required testing comes in the wake of a fatal crash earlier this month that involved a man driving his NIO ES8 using NOP in Southeast China.
- NIO ($NIO) is a leading EV automaker founded in Shanghai in 2014. While NIO was first known for its electric SUVs like the ES8, the automaker announced its first luxury sedan, the ET7, to compete with EVs like the Tesla Model S.
- This past May, NIO announced it will be expanding to Europe, beginning with sales in Norway. This was followed by news that it had been approved for mass production of its ES8 SUV throughout Europe.
- While NIO’s expansion to Norway had been filling the news cycle with good press, an unfortunate accident in China this month focused a negative spotlight on the potential dangers of self-driving technologies. A 31-year-old man was killed when his NIO ES8 crashed while operating under the EVs NOP assisted driving.
- In addition to negativity surrounding the death, the company was accused of tampering with the EV’s data following the crash, an accusation the automaker firmly denies. An investigation into the matter remains underway.
- To help prevent future tragic events surrounding its assisted driving technologies, NIO has now implemented a test on its app for all drivers to pass, before operating any self-driving.
- In a report from CnEVPost, the NIO app began pushing out a new test for EV owners surrounding proper safety and operation of its Navigate on Pilot (NOP) assisted driving feature.
- The new update features a six-minute informative video, followed by a 10-question multiple choice quiz. The video introduces and explains key features of NIO Pilot and reemphasizes NOP as an assisted driving feature, not autonomous driving.
- The video also points out that NOP is an assisted driving feature created to help the driver control the vehicle, cruise adaptively, and maintain lane presence. That being said, the driver must still remain alert and in control of the vehicle themselves.
- When the video is complete, app users must answer all 10 questions correct to receive 200 NIO credits, and access to the assisted driving feature.
- This is not the first instance of drivers taking advantage of assisted driving features to cheat autonomy. A Tesla driver as well as a Li Auto owner have been filmed endangering themselves and those around them by tricking assisted driving systems.
- This isn’t the first attempt to combat such behavior either. This past spring, NIO competitor XPeng introduced a similar test feature before its drivers could use its Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP) feature.
