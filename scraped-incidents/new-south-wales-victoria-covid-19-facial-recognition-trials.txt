- Australian provinces South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales are trialling facial recognition software that enables police to check whether people are quarantining at home during COVID-19.
- In the trial, people must respond to random check-in requests by taking a photo of themselves at their designated home quarantine address.
- Police may follow up with a visit to the location to confirm the person's whereabouts should the software not verify the image against their 'facial signature'.
- Rights advocates warn the technology may be inaccurate, threaten people's privacy, and be used by the police for other purposes.

- SYDNEY, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Australia's two most populous states are trialling facial recognition software that lets police check people are home during COVID-19 quarantine, expanding trials that have sparked controversy to the vast majority of the country's population.
- Little-known tech firm Genvis Pty Ltd said on a website for its software that New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, home to Sydney, Melbourne and more than half of Australia's 25 million population, were trialling its facial recognition products. Genvis said the trials were being conducted on a voluntary basis.
- The Perth, Western Australia-based startup developed the software in 2020 with WA state police to help enforce pandemic movement restrictions, and has said it hopes to sell its services abroad.
- South Australia state began trialling a similar, non-Genvis technology last month, sparking warnings from privacy advocates around the world about potential surveillance overreach. The involvement of New South Wales and Victoria, which have not disclosed that they are trialling facial recognition technology, may amplify those concerns.
- NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said in an email the state was "close to piloting some home quarantine options for returning Australians", without directly responding to questions about Genvis facial recognition software. Police in NSW referred questions to the state premier.
- Victoria Police referred questions to the Victorian Health department, which did not respond to requests for comment.
- Under the system being trialled, people respond to random check-in requests by taking a 'selfie' at their designated home quarantine address. If the software, which also collects location data, does not verify the image against a "facial signature", police may follow up with a visit to the location to confirm the person's whereabouts.
- Though the technology has been used in WA since last November, it has more recently been pitched as a tool to enable the country to reopen its borders, ending a system in place since the start of the pandemic that requires international arrivals to spend two weeks in hotel quarantine under police guard.
- Aside from the pandemic, police forces have expressed interest in using facial recognition software, prompting a backlash from rights groups about the potential to target minority groups.
- While the recognition technology has been used in countries like China, no other democracy has been reported as considering its use in connection with coronavirus containment procedures.  read more
- Genvis Chief Executive Kirstin Butcher declined to comment on the trials, beyond the disclosures on the product website.
- "You can't have home quarantine without compliance checks, if you're looking to keep communities safe," she said in a phone interview.
- "You can't perform physical compliance checks at the scale needed to support (social and economic) re-opening plans so technology has to be used."
- But rights advocates warned the technology may be inaccurate, and may open the window for law enforcement agencies to use people's data for other purposes without specific laws stopping them.
- "I'm troubled not just by the use here but by the fact this is an example of the creeping use of this sort of technology in our lives," said Toby Walsh, a professor of Artificial Intelligence at University of NSW.
- Walsh questioned the reliability of facial recognition technology in general, which he said could be hacked to give false location reports.
- "Even if it works here ... then it validates the idea that facial recognition is a good thing," he said. "Where does it end?"
- The government of Western Australia has said it banned police from using data collected by COVID-related software for non-COVID matters. The WA police say they have put 97,000 people through home quarantine, using facial recognition, without incident.
- "The law should prevent a system for monitoring quarantine being used for other purposes," said Edward Santow, a former Australian Human Rights Commissioner who now leads an artificial intelligence ethics project at University of Technology, Sydney.
- "Facial recognition technology might seem like a convenient way to monitor people in quarantine but ... if something goes wrong with this technology, the risk of harm is high."

- The NSW government will adopt a smartphone app that uses the same facial recognition and geolocation technology as South Australia for its home-based isolation pilot next month.
- Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Friday revealed the planned trial that will involve 175 fully-vaccinated people, including a combination of NSW residents, non-Australian residents and Qantas air crew.
- The pilot, which will be operated and monitored by NSW Health and NSW Police, will run over a four-week period in preparation for the opening of international borders as early as November.
- Under the home quarantine pilot, the isolation period will be reduced from 14 to seven days, with the findings expected to inform future quarantine programs.
- The NSW app will be “based on that already in use in South Australia”, ending speculation the state would trial another app.
- SA's app, dubbed Home Quarantine SA, has been piloted since late last month, and uses geolocation and face recognition technology to confirm a person’s location during home quarantine.
- It gives users 15 minutes to respond to location verification requests at random intervals throughout the day.
- Much like Home Quarantine SA, the NSW app will also “provide people with a testing schedule and symptom checker”.
- The government has also stressed that “privacy will protected through the same mechanisms as the current Service NSW check-in regulations”.
- NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the program will allow the state to bring home more Australians from overseas.
- “Home quarantine has been an important line of defence throughout this pandemic but as we move towards our vaccination targets, we have to look at new ways of doing things,” she said.
- Prime Minister Scott Morrison added that the pilot was the “next step in our plan to safely reopen, and to stay safely open”.
- Reports emerged on Thursday that NSW and Victoria were trialling a similar app from Perth-based software company GenVis, which is used in Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory.
- GenVis’ website shows that the “G2G suite is being utilised by the WA Police Force, the NT government, Department of Health Victoria and the Tasmanian government”.

- Australian officials will trial a home quarantine system for fully vaccinated international travellers arriving in Sydney, prime minister Scott Morrison said on Friday.
- It comes as the country moves to reopen its borders despite persistent Covid cases.
- Australia closed its international border in March 2020 in response to the pandemic.
- Citizens and permanent residents are allowed to return but must undergo a mandatory two-week hotel quarantine at their own expense.
- “This is the next step in our plan to safely reopen, and to stay safely open,” Mr Morrison said, adding the trial could set the standard for the way “we live with Covid-19.”
- Sydney, which has received more returning residents from abroad than other Australian city, will trial the seven-day home quarantine program later this month.
- Authorities will use a mobile phone app and face recognition technology to monitor compliance by around 175 people, including residents, non-residents and some Qantas air crew.
- “This is very welcome news for our crews who have been flying overseas to bring Australians home and to carry essential freight, chalking up months in quarantine since the pandemic began,” Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said in a statement.
- The use of the technology, already piloted with returning defence personnel in the state of South Australia, has been criticised by privacy campaigners.
- Australia has locked down Sydney and Melbourne, its largest cities, and the capital Canberra, impacting nearly half its 25 million population, in response to an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant that began in June.
- Victoria reported 510 new cases, the majority in state capital Melbourne, on Friday, its second-highest daily rise this year, and one death.
- New South Wales reported 1,284 new cases, most in Sydney, down from 1,351 on Thursday, and 12 deaths.
- Morrison announced the home quarantine trial ahead of a national cabinet meeting later in the day where federal and state leaders plan to discuss vaccine passports and further easing of curbs.
- The federal government’s reopening plans are predicated on Australia reaching a 70-80 per cent vaccination rate for its adult population.
- The national rate is currently at around 45 per cent but is expected to pick up speed with just over 70 per cent of people over the age of 16 having received a first dose.
- Both New South Wales and Victorian leaders have outlined new freedoms for vaccinated adults, with some restrictions in gatherings and travel in Melbourne to be eased from Friday night after Victoria reached its 70 per cent first-dose target a week early.
- However, not all state and territory leaders agree with the reopening plans, with some preferring to maintain an eradication strategy.
- Even with the fast-moving Delta outbreak, Australia has largely avoided high numbers seen in many comparable countries, with some 82,000 cases and 1,141 deaths, through swift lockdowns and hotel quarantine for international travellers.

- As the country’s crackdown on coronavirus restrictions continues, parts of Australia are introducing a new facial recognition app to keep tabs on people quarantining.
- The trial is taking place in South Australia (SA), and is aimed at ensuring people quarantine at home – and stay at home throughout the quarantine period.
- While initially intended for people returning to New South Wales and Victoria, Premier Steven Marshall hopes the trial will expand to international travellers in ‘subsequent weeks’.
- The experimental trial involves those quarantining at home downloading an app developed by the South Australian Government, which will use facial recognition and geo-location to make sure people are staying at home.
- The app will contact people at random, ABC News reports, and will require those quarantining to prove their location within 15 minutes of receiving the notification.
- Premier Marshall added, ‘We don’t tell them how often or when, on a random basis they have to reply within 15 minutes.’
- If the person does not verify their identity or location, the police will be alerted and carry out an in-person check. ‘We just use it to verify that people are where they said they were going to be during the home-based quarantine,’ Marshall said.
- Writing in The Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf described the app as ‘Orwellian’, asking, ‘If a country indefinitely forbids its own citizens from leaving its borders […] puts strict rules on intrastate travel, prohibits citizens from leaving home without an excuse from an official government list […] is that country still a liberal democracy?’
- However, Friedersdorf also noted that Australia’s strict rules to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have worked in the past; the virus has killed 194 of every 100,000 Americans, but only four of every 100,000 Australians.
- Marshall said the SA government is trialling the app because it’s ‘implausible’ to carry on using medi-hotels for international travellers to quarantine in as the country begins to open its borders again.
- He said:
- We are trying to take some of the cost associated with home-based quarantine out.
- In the past where we have had this option for people coming from interstate and in the early days from overseas, it required a very heavy police presence to go and check on them.
- Now we have had a great uptake of the QR code check-in app here in South Australia, people say it’s the best in the country, I think they’re right and now we are the national selected pilot for this home-based quarantine app.
- The government hopes the use of the app during home-based quarantine will increase quarantine capacity, while also reducing reliance on police officers enforcing isolation measures.

- Australia will test a home quarantine system using facial recognition technology for fully vaccinated international arrivals as it seeks to reopen international borders.
- Tens of thousands of Australians remain stranded overseas because so few travellers are allowed in after 18 months of restrictive travel rules. The authorities will use a mobile phone app and facial recognition technology to monitor compliance by about 175 people on the trial, including residents, non-residents and some Qantas air crew.
- “This is the next step in our plan to safely reopen, and to stay safely open,” Scott Morrison, the prime minister, said today. He said the trial could pave the way for how “we live with Covid-19”.

- NSW Council for Civil Liberties wants a moratorium on the use of biometrics and facial recognition
- Civil liberty groups say an app being trialled in South Australia that uses facial recognition and geolocation to enforce home quarantine during the Covid-19 pandemic should not be used until the proper safeguards are in place.
- South Australia is currently using a government-developed app to enforce home quarantine compliance for a small cohort of returning interstate travellers who opt-in to the trial.
- Users are sent a message at random times and must respond within 15 minutes, verifying their location and identity using facial recognition and geolocation.
- If they fail to do so, SA Health notifies police, who then attend the person’s home for a physical check. The state government has justified the app by citing its potential to reduce the costs associated with hotel quarantine, and say it may be used for international travellers in the future.
- The use of the app has not been widely reported in the Australian media.
- But a piece in US outlet the Atlantic this week described it as “an app as Orwellian as any in the free world to enforce its quarantine rules”. The piece triggered a wave of coverage, including by rightwing outlets Breitbart and Fox News, which condemned Australia for its erosion of civil liberties.
- Police have since defended the app, saying the claims were “absurd”. The state government said it was trialling the app with “a selected cohort of returning South Australians who have applied to be part of the trial”.
- The cohort is about 50 people and the state will report back to national cabinet on its success or failure.
- But the use of such technology without proper safeguards and scrutiny has concerned Australian civil liberty groups too.
- NSW Council for Civil Liberties secretary Michelle Falstein told the Guardian that the lack of primary legislation underpinning apps of this kind has made it difficult to assess how privacy concerns are managed, how long data is being kept, who it’s shared with, and how it is stored.
- “It’s the usual thing, it’s done in a very half-baked way, and without all the necessary provisions about what you actually do with the information you’re collecting,” she said.
- The NSWCCL wants a moratorium on the use of biometrics and facial recognition in apps like South Australia’s.
- Falstein said it was possible for facial verification to be conducted safely and appropriately, with the right safeguards. But she said there were no examples in Australia where such technology had been used in such a way.
- “In principle, if it’s one-for-one facial verification and that information is destroyed as soon as that person is finished in quarantine, and there are a whole lot of other safeguards around it, you’d think ‘that’s fine’,” she said.
- “But that’s not the case in most circumstances. I certainly can’t see anything around about what the South Australian government is doing with its program.”
- The state’s premier, Steven Marshall, has previously said that the information gathered by the app would be kept confidential and be subject to stringent security.
- He also said the government would not be storing information from the app.
- “We just use it to verify that people are where they said they were going to be during the home-based quarantine,” he said.

- South Australia has begun a home-based quarantine trial which is tipped to expand to international arrivals.
- Here's a look at the trial.
- It will start this week for people returning from New South Wales and Victoria.
- Premier Steven Marshall said he hoped the trial would be expanded to international travellers in "subsequent weeks", making it a national first.
- Those in home-based quarantine will need to download an app, developed by the South Australian Government, to prove they are staying home while required to.
- People wanting to return to South Australia and home quarantine will have to apply to SA Health.
- Catch up on the latest COVID-19 news here
- They will have to prove they have a place to isolate during their quarantine period and must also be fully vaccinated.
- Those who are approved will have to download the South Australian Government home quarantine app, which uses geo-location and facial recognition software to track those in quarantine.
- The app will contact people at random asking them to provide proof of their location within 15 minutes.
- "We don't tell them how often or when, on a random basis they have to reply within 15 minutes," Mr Marshall said.
- If a person cannot successfully verify their location or identity when requested, SA Health will notify SA Police who will conduct an in-person check on the person in quarantine.
- People will still be required to quarantine for 14 days.
- The Premier said people were also able to put in daily observations, which could trigger a visit from SA Health.
- Mr Marshall said the government would not be storing any of the information provided to the app.
- "We just use it to verify that people are where they said they were going to be during the home-based quarantine."
- The Premier said it was "implausible" to continue to use medi-hotels for international arrivals as borders began to re-open.
- The government hopes the use of technology during home-based quarantine would not only increase quarantine capacity, but also reduce the reliance on police officers having to knock on doors to check on people quarantining.
- "We are trying to take some of the cost associated with home-based quarantine out," Mr Marshall said.
- "In the past where we have had this option for people coming from interstate and in the early days from overseas, it required a very heavy police presence to go and check on them.
- "Now we have had a great uptake of the QR code check-in app here in South Australia, people say it's the best in the country, I think they're right and now we are the national selected pilot for this home-based quarantine app."
- He said if the trials were successful, international arrivals could be home-quarantining using the new app in the next few weeks.
- WA and Tasmania have been using apps to quarantine people from interstate, but not overseas arrivals.
- Now. There are people using the home-based quarantine app from today.
- "The very first person using the home-based quarantine app is now in place,' Mr Marshall said.
- "This is part of a pilot of around 50 people.
- "I think every South Australian should feel pretty proud that we are the national pilot for the home-based quarantine app."
- The Premier said South Australia will report results back to National Cabinet in the coming weeks.
- Mr Marshall said South Australia took the home-based quarantine idea to National Cabinet "in the month last month or two".

- But in November 2020, West Australian based firm GenVis was selected as the successful tenderer for the $1.1 million contract to provide a COVID-19 home quarantine compliance app.
- The company's G2G app uses facial recognition and GPS tracking technology to check-in on people in isolation.
- The company already provides services to the WA Government with its G2G Now — a program developed in conjunction with WA Police.
- Work began on adapting the platform for South Australia, but in February the deal with GenVis was scrapped.
- "The development proposal with that company has not been successful and our relationship with them in relation to that program will not continue," Health Minister Stephen Wade told Parliament.
- The new South Australian app has been developed by the State Government.
- It's understood the same team who came up with the COVIDSafe check-in function has been involved.
- "I'm pretty sure the technology that we have developed within the South Australia Government will become the national standard and will be rolled out across the country," Mr Marshall.

- How long can a democracy maintain emergency restrictions and still call itself a free country?
- Updated at 12:20 p.m. ET on September 3, 2021.
- In a bid to keep the coronavirus out of the country, Australia’s federal and state governments imposed draconian restrictions on its citizens. Prime Minister Scott Morrison knows that the burden is too heavy. “This is not a sustainable way to live in this country,” he recently declared. One prominent civil libertarian summed up the rules by lamenting, “We’ve never seen anything like this in our lifetimes.”
- Up to now one of Earth’s freest societies, Australia has become a hermit continent. How long can a country maintain emergency restrictions on its citizens’ lives while still calling itself a liberal democracy?
- Australia has been testing the limits.
- Before 2020, the idea of Australia all but forbidding its citizens from leaving the country, a restriction associated with Communist regimes, was unthinkable. Today, it is a widely accepted policy. “Australia’s borders are currently closed and international travel from Australia remains strictly controlled to help prevent the spread of COVID-19,” a government website declares. “International travel from Australia is only available if you are exempt or you have been granted an individual exemption.” The rule is enforced despite assurances on another government website, dedicated to setting forth Australia’s human-rights-treaty obligations, that the freedom to leave a country “cannot be made dependent on establishing a purpose or reason for leaving.”
- Conor Friedersdorf: How to protect civil liberties in a pandemic
- The nation’s high court struck down a challenge to the country’s COVID-19 restrictions. “It may be accepted that the travel restrictions are harsh. It may also be accepted that they intrude upon individual rights,” it ruled. “But Parliament was aware of that.” Until last month, Australians who are residents of foreign countries were exempt from the rule so they could return to their residence. But the government tightened the restrictions further, trapping many of them in the country too.
- Intrastate travel within Australia is also severely restricted. And the government of South Australia, one of the country’s six states, developed and is now testing an app as Orwellian as any in the free world to enforce its quarantine rules. Returning travelers quarantining at home will be forced to download an app that combines facial recognition and geolocation. The state will text them at random times, and thereafter they will have 15 minutes to take a picture of their face in the location where they are supposed to be. Should they fail, the local police department will be sent to follow up in person. “We don’t tell them how often or when, on a random basis they have to reply within 15 minutes,” Premier Steven Marshall explained. “I think every South Australian should feel pretty proud that we are the national pilot for the home-based quarantine app.”
- Other states also curtailed their citizens’ liberty in the name of safety. The state of Victoria announced a curfew and suspended its Parliament for key parts of the pandemic. “To put this in context, federal and state parliaments sat during both world wars and the Spanish Flu, and curfews have never been imposed,” the scholar John Lee observed in an article for the Brookings Institution. “In responding to a question about whether he had gone too far with respect to imposing a curfew (avoiding the question of why a curfew was needed when no other state had one), Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews replied: ‘it is not about human rights. It is about human life.’”
- In New South Wales, Police Minister David Elliott defended the deployment of the Australian military to enforce lockdowns, telling the BBC that some residents of the state thought “the rules didn’t apply to them.” In Sydney, where more than 5 million people have been in lockdown for more than two months, and Melbourne, the country’s second-biggest city, anti-lockdown protests were banned, and when dissenters gathered anyway, hundreds were arrested and fined, Reuters reported.
- Australia is undoubtedly a democracy, with multiple political parties, regular elections, and the peaceful transfer of power. But if a country indefinitely forbids its own citizens from leaving its borders, strands tens of thousands of its citizens abroad, puts strict rules on intrastate travel, prohibits citizens from leaving home without an excuse from an official government list, mandates masks even when people are outdoors and socially distanced, deploys the military to enforce those rules, bans protest, and arrests and fines dissenters, is that country still a liberal democracy?
- Read: New Zealand’s prime minister may be the most effective leader on the planet
- Enduring rules of that sort would certainly render a country a police state. In year two of the pandemic, with COVID-19 now thought to be endemic, rather than a temporary emergency the nation could avoid, how much time must pass before we must regard Australia as illiberal and unfree?
- To give Australia’s approach its due, temporary restrictions on liberty were far more defensible early in the pandemic, when many countries locked down and scientists understood little about COVID-19’s attributes or trajectory. Australian leaders hoped to “flatten the curve” of infection in an effort to prevent overcrowded hospitals and degraded care, and the higher death rates that would follow. The country was also betting that, within a time period short enough that restrictions could be sustained, scientists would develop a vaccine that protected against morbidity and mortality.
- As it turned out, the bet paid off. Had it behaved rationally and adequately valued liberty, a rich nation like Australia would have spent lavishly—before knowing which vaccines would turn out to be most effective—to secure an adequate supply of many options for its people. It could afford to eat the cost of any extra doses and donate them to poorer countries. Australia then could have marshaled its military and civil society to vaccinate the nation as quickly as possible, lifted restrictions more fully than Europe and the United States did, and argued that the combination of fewer deaths and the more rapid return to normalcy made their approach a net win.
- Instead, Australia invested inadequately in vaccines and, once it acquired doses, was too slow to get them into arms. “Of the 16 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that have been released to the government by manufacturer CSL, only about 8 million have gone into the arms of Australians,” The Age reported on August 21, citing concern about blood clots and a widespread preference for the Pfizer vaccine. “A further 1.6 million doses have been sent offshore to help regional neighbours such as Papua New Guinea, Fiji and East Timor tackle COVID-19. But about 6 million doses are yet to be used, even as more than half the nation is in lockdown due to outbreaks of the highly infectious Delta variant.” Australia’s low infection and death rates, which the country achieved both by being surrounded by water and by adopting harsh restrictions on liberty, seemed to sap its urgency when it came time to vaccinate—even though that lack of urgency meant months more of basic human rights being abrogated. In hindsight, more urgency to get jabs in arms to end the restrictions would have saved lives, because the country would have been better protected against the unexpected Delta variant.
- In return for trading away their liberty, Australians gained a huge safety dividend. COVID-19 has killed 194 of every 100,000 Americans, 77 of every 100,000 Israelis, and only four of every 100,000 Australians. That low death toll is a tremendous upside. What remains to be seen is whether Australia can maintain that performance without permanently ending core attributes of life in a liberal democracy, including freedom of movement, peaceable assembly, and basic privacy.

- If the country quickly reinstates its citizens’ pre-pandemic liberties, it can argue that the loss of liberty was only temporary (though some restrictions, such as a prohibition on leaving the country, would still seem needless if the goal was minimizing the spread of COVID-19 in the country). And if Australia’s death rate remains lower than Israel’s or America’s, Australian leaders can plausibly tell their citizens that the deprivation was worth it. If not, supporters will have a much harder time defending a record that includes handcuffing a small group of teenagers after they gathered for an outdoor hangout.
- More important than whether or not the past can be justified is what the country does from now on. Promising murmurs are coming from some politicians. “New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian vowed to reopen the state once 70% of those 16 and older get vaccinated,” Reuters reported Sunday. “No matter what the case numbers are doing … double-dose 70% in NSW means freedom for those who are vaccinated." But in Victoria, the country’s next-most-populous state, the news organization reports that “Premier Daniel Andrews said his state’s lockdown, due to end on Thursday, will be extended, but would not say for how long.”
- Because of its geography, Australia is a neighbor and an observer of authoritarian countries as varied as China and Singapore. But its own fate, too, may turn on whether its people crave the feeling of safety and security that orders from the top confer, or whether they want to be free.
