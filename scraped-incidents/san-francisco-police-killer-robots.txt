- A policy authorising the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) to use military-style weapons, including remote-controlled robots, to kill suspects has been put on hold by the city's supervisors.
- According to the SFPD, it's existing armoury of 17 Remotec and QinetiQ robots could be equipped with explosives 'to contact, incapacitate, or disorient [a] violent, armed, or dangerous suspect' in 'extreme circumstances to save or prevent further loss of innocent lives.'
- Late November 2022, San Francisco's board of supervisors approved a policy that lets police robots 'be used as a deadly force option when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available.'
- However, the decision resulted in an immediate backlash from civil rights groups. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argued it was typical police-military mission creep. The San Francisco Public Defender’s office warned that granting police 'the ability to kill community members remotely' went against the city’s progressive values.
- A week later the boad suspended the policy, sending it back to back to committee for further discussion.

- The San Francisco Board of Supervisors will vote soon on a policy that would allow the San Francisco Police Department to use deadly force by arming its many robots. This is a spectacularly dangerous idea and EFF’s stance is clear: police should not arm robots.

- EMAIL YOUR SUPERVISOR: don't let SFPD arm robots
- Police technology goes through mission creep–meaning equipment reserved only for specific or extreme circumstances ends up being used in increasingly everyday or casual ways. We’ve already seen this with military-grade predator drones flying over protests, and police buzzing by the window of an activist's home with drones.
- As the policy is currently written, the robots' use will be governed by this passage:
- “The robots listed in this section shall not be utilized outside of training and simulations, criminal apprehensions, critical incidents, exigent circumstances, executing a warrant or during suspicious device assessments. Robots will only be used as a deadly force option when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available to SFPD.”
- This is incredibly broad language. Police could bring armed robots to every arrest, and every execution of a warrant to search a house or vehicle or device. Depending on how police choose to define the words “critical” or “exigent,” police might even bring armed robots to a protest. While police could only use armed robots as deadly force when the risk of death is imminent, this problematic legal standard has often been under-enforced by courts and criticized by activists.
- The combination of new technology, deadly weapons, tense situations, and a remote control trigger is a very combustible brew.
- This occurs as many police departments have imported the use of robots from military use into regular policing procedures, and now fight to arm those robots.
- In October 2022, the Oakland police department proposed a similar policy to arm robots. Following public outrage, the plans were scrapped within a week.
- The San Francisco Board of Supervisors will be voting on whether to pass this bill on first reading at their November 29, 2022 meeting, which begins at 2pm. You can find an email contact for your Board of Supervisors member here, and determine which Supervisor to contact here. Please tell them to oppose this. Here's text you can use (or edit):
- Do not give SFPD permission to kill people with robots. This broad policy would allow police to bring armed robots to every arrest, and every execution of a warrant to search a house or vehicle or device. Depending on how police choose to define the words “critical” or “exigent,” police might even bring armed robots to a protest. While police could only use armed robots as deadly force when the risk of death is imminent, this problematic legal standard has often been under-enforced by courts and criticized by activists. For the sake of your constituents' rights and safety, please vote no.

- 
- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco supervisors voted Tuesday to put the brakes on a controversial policy that would have let police use robots for deadly force, reversing course just days after their approval of the plan generated fierce pushback and warnings about the militarization and automation of policing.
- The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to explicitly ban the use of robots in such a fashion for now. But they sent the issue back to a committee for further discussion and could vote in the future to let police use robots in a lethal manner in limited cases.
- The board voted last week to allow the use of deadly robots in extreme circumstances. The police department said it had no plans to arm the robots with guns but wanted the ability to put explosives on them and use then to contact, incapacitate or disorient dangerous or armed suspects when lives are at risk.
- The initial vote thrust the famously liberal city into the center of a debate about the future of technology and policing, with some saying arming robots was a step too close to something one would see in a dystopian science fiction movie. Though robot technology for policing has become more widely available, departments across the country have rarely used it to confront or kill suspects.
- Three supervisors who rejected the policy from the beginning joined dozens of protesters Monday outside City Hall to urge the board to change course. They chanted and held signs with phrases like “We all saw that movie... No Killer Robots.”
- Supervisor Dean Preston was among them, and on Tuesday he told his colleagues the public hadn’t been given enough time to voice their concerns about such a pressing issue.
- “The people of San Francisco have spoken loud and clear: There is no place for killer police robots in our city,” he said in a statement after the vote. “We should be working on ways to decrease the use of force by local law enforcement, not giving them new tools to kill people.”
- The vote was the result of a new state law that requires police departments to inventory equipment including certain guns, grenades, armored vehicles and battering rams and to seek explicit approval for their use. So far, only San Francisco and Oakland have discussed lethal robots as part of that law. Oakland police wanted to arm robots with shotguns but backed down in the face of public opposition, instead opting for pepper spray.
- Some San Francisco officials wanted to proceed with allowing robots to use deadly force in certain cases, arguing nothing substantive had changed to warrant a reversal. But the vote to advance the broader police equipment policy — including the ban on lethal robots — passed unanimously.
- It still allows police to use robots to check out potentially dangerous scenes so that officers can stay back.
- “Having robots that have eyes and ears and can remove bombs, which happens from time to time, is something that we want the police department to do while we continue to have this very controversial discussion,” said Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who brought forward last week’s motion around the use of robots.
- The new policy needs another vote to take effect.

- The vote in favour of the policy came after fierce debate and condemnation from civil liberties groups.
- Wednesday 30 November 2022 13:47, UK
- Police in San Francisco will be allowed to use remote-controlled robots that can kill, despite fierce opposition from civil liberties groups.
- Opponents of the move said it would lead to the further militarisation of a police force already too aggressive with poor and minority communities.
- The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) says it does not have pre-armed robots and has no plans to arm robots with guns.
- However the department could deploy robots equipped with explosive charges "to contact, incapacitate, or disorient violent, armed, or dangerous suspect" when lives are at stake, SFPD spokesperson Allison Maxie said.
- "Robots equipped in this manner would only be used in extreme circumstances to save or prevent further loss of innocent lives," she said.
- The police force currently has a dozen ground robots, used to assess bombs or provide reconnaissance in low visibility environments.
- However explicit authorisation to use robots as a type of force was required after a new California law went into effect this year requiring police and sheriffs departments to inventory military-grade equipment and seek approval for their use.

- Debate on Tuesday ran more than two hours with members on both sides accusing the other of fearmongering.
- Board president Shamann Walton, who voted against the proposal, said doing so made him not anti-police, but "pro people of colour".
- "We continuously are being asked to do things in the name of increasing weaponry and opportunities for negative interaction between the police department and people of colour," he said. "This is just one of those things."
- The San Francisco Public Defender's office sent a letter Monday to the board saying that granting police "the ability to kill community members remotely" goes against the city's progressive values.
- The office wanted the board to reinstate language barring police from using robots against any person in an act of force.
- Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, who voted in favour of the policy, said he was troubled by rhetoric painting the police department as untrustworthy and dangerous.
- "I think there's larger questions raised when progressives and progressive policies start looking to the public like they are anti-police," he said.
- On the other side of the San Francisco Bay, the Oakland Police Department has dropped a similar proposal after public backlash.
- The first time a robot was used to deliver explosives in the US was in 2016, when Dallas police sent in an armed robot that killed a holed-up sniper who had killed five officers in an ambush.

URL: https://www.engadget.com/san-francisco-police-seek-permission-for-its-robots-to-use-deadly-force-183514906.html
- The San Francisco Police Department is currently petitioning the city's Board of Supervisors for permission to deploy robots to kill suspects that law enforcement deems a sufficient threat that the "risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available to SFPD." The draft policy, which was written by the SFPD itself, also seeks to exclude "hundreds of assault rifles from its inventory of military-style weapons and for not include personnel costs in the price of its weapons," according to a report from Mission Local.
- As Mission Local notes, this proposal has already seen significant opposition from both within and without the Board. Supervisor Aaron Peskin, initially pushed back against the use of force requirements, inserting “Robots shall not be used as a Use of Force against any person," into the policy language. The SFPD removed that wording in a subsequent draft, which I as a lifelong San Francisco resident did not know was something that they could just do. The three-member Rules Committee, which Peskin chairs, then unanimously approved that draft and advanced it to the full Board of Supervisors for a vote on November 29th. Peskin excused his decision by claiming that “there could be scenarios where deployment of lethal force was the only option.”
- The police force currently maintains a dozen fully-functional remote-controlled robots, which are typically used for area inspections and bomb disposal. However, as the Dallas PD showed in 2016, they make excellent bomb delivery platforms as well. Bomb disposal units are often equipped with blank shotgun shells used to forcibly disrupt an explosive device's internal workings, though there is nothing stopping police from using live rounds if they needed, as Oakland police recently acknowledged to that city's civilian oversight board.
- While San Francisco has never explicitly allowed for robots to take human lives, lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs), are increasingly common in modern warfare. Anti-personnel mines, one of the earliest iterations of automated weaponry, have been banned since 1997 (but tell that to the mines already in the ground) and fully automated defenses like shipboard Phalanx systems have been in use since the 1970s. Autonomous offensive systems, such as UAVs and combat drones, have been used for years but have always required a "human in the loop" to bear the responsibility of actually firing the weapons. Now, the SFPD — the same department that regularly costs the city six-figure settlements for its excessive use of force and actively opposes investigations into its affinity for baton-based beatings — wants to wield that same life-and-death power over San Francisco's civilians.

- A policy proposal heading for Board of Supervisors approval next week would explicitly authorize San Francisco police to kill suspects using robots.
- The new policy, which defines how the SFPD is allowed to use its military-style weapons, was put together by the police department. Over the past several weeks, it has been scrutinized by supervisors Aaron Peskin, Rafael Mandelman and Connie Chan, who together comprise the Board of Supervisors Rules Committee.
- The draft policy faces criticism from advocates for its language on robot force, as well as for excluding hundreds of assault rifles from its inventory of military-style weapons and for not including personnel costs in the price of its weapons.
- Peskin, chair of the committee, initially attempted to limit the SFPD’s authority over the department’s robots by inserting the sentence, “Robots shall not be used as a Use of Force against any person.”
- The following week, the police struck out his suggestion with a thick red line.
- It was replaced by language that codifies the department’s authority to use lethal force via robots: “Robots will only be used as a deadly force option when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers are imminent and outweigh any other force option available to SFPD.”
- This could mark a legal crossing of the Rubicon for the city: Robot use-of-force has never before been approved, nor has it ever been prohibited, in San Francisco. A version of this draft policy was unanimously accepted by the rules committee last week and will come before the full board on Nov. 29.
- “The original policy they submitted was actually silent on whether robots could deploy lethal force,” said Peskin. He added that he decided to approve the SFPD’s caveated guidelines because the department had made the case that “there could be scenarios where deployment of lethal force was the only option.”
- Advocates and lawyers who oppose the militarization of the police are less convinced.
- “We are living in a dystopian future, where we debate whether the police may use robots to execute citizens without a trial, jury, or judge,” said Tifanei Moyer, senior staff attorney at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area. Moyer leads the organization’s work on police misconduct and militarization.
- “This is not normal,” she wrote over email. “No legal professional or ordinary resident should carry on as if it is normal.”
- The SFPD has 17 robots in its arsenal, 12 of which it describes as fully functional. According to police spokesperson Officer Robert Rueca, they have never been used to attack anyone. The robots are remote-controlled, and are typically used to investigate and defuse potential bombs or to surveil areas too awkward or dangerous for officers to access.

- Uses defined in the new draft policy include “training and simulations, criminal apprehensions, critical incidents, exigent circumstances, executing a warrant or during suspicious device assessments.”
- And, in extreme circumstances, they can be used to kill.
- In 2016, the Dallas police force strapped plastic explosives to a robot and used it to blow up a sharpshooter who had killed five officers, in the first U.S. instance of a police robot killing a suspect. One of the SFPD’s robots, the Remotec F5A, is the same model as the one used by Dallas police.
- More recently in Oakland, a policy on lethal robots came before the city’s police department’s civilian oversight council. One device they discussed was the PAN disruptor, a device that can be attached to a remote-controlled robot and uses a blank shotgun shell to disable a bomb by blasting it with pressurized water. Oakland police acknowledged that, in emergencies, they could arm it with live rounds. The SFPD also has multiple PAN disruptors that can be attached to robots and fire shotgun shells.
- Last month, Oakland police ultimately backed down and removed language that would have allowed them to kill using robots. They said they hope to pursue the option in the future.
- Rueca said that the San Francisco Police Department “does not have any sort of specific plan in place” for how lethal force would be applied with robots as “the unusually dangerous or spontaneous operations where SFPD’s need to deliver deadly force via robot would be a rare and exceptional circumstance.”
- Cities across California are currently drafting new policies on the use of military weapons by local police forces, thanks to a state law called AB 481, which passed last year. Figuring out the force options of robots is one small part of the law’s remit.
- The law mandates that every police force in California must annually report its stock of all military-style weapons, their cost, how they can be used, and how they were deployed in the prior year. The law gives local authorities — in San Francisco’s case, the Board of Supervisors — the ability to annually reject or accept the rules governing how the weapons are used.
- The Board will also be required to sign off on any new military-style equipment before purchase, although the police will be able to replace any existing equipment up to a value of $10 million without approval.
- Most advocates opposed to the militarization of the police hail AB 481 as a step in the right direction for accountability and transparency. But concerns have been raised that some jurisdictions have not gone far enough in limiting how military-style weapons can be used.
- Jennifer Tu, a fellow with the American Friends Service Committee, has been tracking how police departments across the state are implementing AB 481.
- “My suspicion is that most policies will have left room for robots to use force,” said Tu. She said that it was her understanding that most departments have not mentioned robots at all, which means they are subject only to generic restrictions.
- The ACLU has published advice on the use of robots by police, and notes that the limited situational awareness of robots, compared to in-person officers, make it more likely that force is “used inappropriately and/or on the wrong targets.”
- “There is a really big difference between hurting someone right in front of you, and hurting someone via a video screen,” said Tu.
- Tu contended that, on top of the issue of robot force, there are other problems with San Francisco’s draft policy, as it currently stands.
- In its initial submission, the SFPD omitted all of its 608 semi-automatic assault rifles, 64 machine guns, and 15 submachine guns from the new use-of-force policy. According to Peskin, these were added in when he pushed back on their omission. But in the department’s latest version, which is set to come before the supervisors next week, 375 of the semi-automatic assault rifles are missing again.
- The rationale given for the removal of these assault rifles from the policy: The Chief of Police defines them as “standard-issue service weapons.”
- Others disagree with that assessment. “We don’t see regular officers walking around with assault rifles,” said Allyssa Victory, staff attorney with the criminal justice program at the ACLU of Northern California (and recent Oakland mayoral hopeful). “Just writing a policy doesn’t make it so.”
- Victory added that shotguns and handguns can be omitted because they are standard issue, according to AB 481, but no such exemption applies to assault rifles.
- “The law defines ‘military weapons,’ not the chief of police,” wrote civil rights lawyer Moyer over email. “San Francisco is not the only department to attempt to redefine ‘military weapons’ so as to justify hiding their use, costs, and upkeep from the public.”
- “If the law defined military weapons as bubble gum, then the police department would have to disclose their use of bubble gum,” she wrote.
- Tu added, “I really think it is confusing to the public if we don’t have those assault weapons reported.” Their omission would mean that in future annual reports, the police would not need to declare how the guns had been used or who had been injured by them.
- Another point of contention with advocates is that the SFPD has not included personnel training or maintenance times in their valuation of the cost of their military-style weapons. This appears to be required by AB 481, which states that costs must include “acquisition, personnel, training, transportation, maintenance, storage, upgrade, and other ongoing costs” of the weapons.
- But the SFPD rejected a suggestion from the American Friends Service Committee to include personnel costs. The department said that maintenance and training occur during normal work hours, and that their human resources management system cannot track different types of work done by officers, so “there is no compelling reason to track in the suggested manner.”
- It remains to be seen if the policy, as it stands, will be approved by the Board of Supervisors, and what limitations will ultimately be placed on the police department’s military-style weapons, including its robots. And, once the rules are settled, the process will begin again with the Sheriff’s Department, which will need to create its own policy to stay in compliance with AB 481.
- “The great news about this thing is that it can be evolved,” said Peskin, adding that policy must be scrutinized and approved every year if the SFPD wants to keep using its weapons.
- “And I think we are starting off in a good place.”
- This policy will be discussed at the Board of Supervisors meeting on Tuesday November 29. The meeting starts at 2 p.m. and the police equipment policy is agenda item 28. More details can be found in the full meeting agenda.

- Insane! APRIL 12, 2019 Police Not Required to Protect; Are They Required to Serve?
- In DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services, 489 U.S. 189 (1989), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the only duties of care required by the Constitution are those extended to individuals who are restrained by the government and therefore unable to protect themselves. This includes prisoners and involuntarily committed mental patients.
- This is stupid. These are not robots. Robots are autonomous.
- There is no material difference between “when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers are imminent and outweigh any other force option” and “when anyone could be killed.”  Because this applies to most situations, this wording gives license to replace officers with deadly robots in most situations. I’m not saying they’ll do worse, but if my self-driving car is any indication, expect a lot of vaguely justifiable misfires for many years.
- Given what I know of history, no police officer should be using a weapon which can kill a person without a trial and conviction first, ever.  These weapons are frightful and presage a future with more pain than we deserve!  Places which have laws against assault weapons and don’t buy robots have far less killing, according to reports we read again and again.
- Where are the peace loving protestors? What has happened to the San Francisco that was love and peace?
- Why does SFPD need to be militarized and why are they proposing to kill at all, robot or not? This is insane!! We need to push back on this!
- Robots do surgery, move boxes in warehouses, and are replacing human jobs. They are accurate and effective. If someone needs to be shot, why not have it done by the most accurate means rather than risking the lives of police and bystanders?
- No one should be dying on our streets. No one. Death is too great a punishment for most and insufficient punishment for some, but never for a police officer to decide. Ever heard of due process?
- Well, it not gonna be the robot that kill us all… it’s  the dumbass that makes the call and controlling it….
- Not exactly bc just a matter of time before this
https://youtu.be/y3RIHnK0_NE
- This is a REALLY sloppy use of language that can have lasting, and very dangerous repercussions.  The Remotec F5A the SFPD used to blow up that sniper is a drone: remotely controlled, not autonomous.  Robots are, by definition, autonomous.  The use of the wrong term here not only inflates this story into the realm of sensationalism, but using the incorrect legal term in official documents like this is unacceptably dangerous.
- With the wording the way it is, the SFPD could strap a pack of C4 to a Raspberry Pi on wheels, try to program it to “go get the bad guy,” and let it go.  BIG difference.
- I can see the need to use a robot to deploy lethal force in some situations. I can also see why many may see that as the robot making the decision. With this equipment, a human interfaces remotely with the robot. Thus, a sworn officer decides when and if lethal force is necessary.
- I think it prudent to have a level of oversight from someone not on the scene to authorize lethal force delivered robotically. That authorization should come from the highest-ranking individual for that agency on duty. The authorization should be via cell phone, but dispatch needs to enter who requested it and who authorized it, with the date and time.
- Another protocol should include an audible warning delivered by the robot, “Our policy dictates that I must warn you to surrender now, or I am authorized to use lethal force. My accuracy rate is 98.99%. The 1.01% survived. That is the only warning I will provide. Surrender now.”
- The warnings should be available on the device for quick selection, but typing and delivering a customized warning is also possible.
- Before the suspect sees the robot, perhaps its speakers should broadcast a K-9 bark track since most people would prefer to get shot than attacked by a police dog.
- Once the suspect surrenders, the robot should do a little jig as it plays “Staying Alive” or “I Fought the Law and the Law Won.”
- Do I want autonomous robots patrolling the streets and interacting with humans? No.
- Semiautomatic AR-15-style rifles are not assault weapons. A rifle must have a selector switch for Single Shot, 3-Burst Shot, Automatic, and Safety to classify as an assault weapon. If the only selector is for Safety and Single Fire, it is a civilian-grade sporting rifle. If people continue changing definitions of standard nomenclature, the entire country will get confused.
- I do not see the need for police agencies to have automatic rifles. I can see Single Shot and 3-Burst, but on automatic, the weapon becomes nearly impossible to aim accurately. If three of thirty rounds strike the target center mass, the other 27 will hit somewhere else. That makes 27 possible collateral deaths.
- How many crimes occur in the US using automatic rifles or pistols? Doing a quick search, I found one instance when someone used an automatic weapon in the past 20 years. I am only looking at weapons manufactured as automatics. I do not include crimes where someone modified a weapon.
- Next, I wanted to know how many AR-15-style rifles account for homicides. Using the latest data in 2019, I surprised myself by realizing the media lies about guns used in homicides. In 2019, there were 16,425 homicides. The following is the number of murders broken down by weapon type:
- – Handguns: 45.7% (7,506)
   – Firearms (Type Unknown): 23.9% (3,926)
   – Other Weapons (rope, pipe, bricks): 11.4% (1,873)
   – Knives or Cutting Instruments: 10.6% (1,741)
   – Hands, Fists, Feet, Etc.: 4.3% (706)
   – Rifles: 2.6% (427)
   – Shotguns: 1.4% (230)
- First things first, rifles only account for 2.6% of gun deaths (427). Of those, less than 1% use AR-15-style rifles (<5). Wow! That blows my mind! All this panic over "assault weapons" to discover that maybe five (5) deaths occurred using one. An automatic rifle saw only one (1) use with no casualties. That use was in MS, not CA.
- Now let us look at gun deaths using data from 2020. The CDC reports 45,222 gun-related deaths in the U.S.
- – 54% suicide (24,420)
  – 43% murder (19,446)
  –    3% other (1,356)
                 – unintentional (509)
                 – law enforcement (503)
                 – undetermined (344)
- Between 2019 and 2020, there were more homicides, but the weapons used had similar percentages. The 2020 data was not complete, so I interpolated the percentage of each category of weapons used for murder. Since the weapon type between 2018 and 2019 was nearly identical, you can safely use those percentages to figure out the weapons used in 2020.
- If criminals lack access to automatic weapons, why should the police use them? In my mind, the police have a sign in front of their building daring some action movie cast to steal their hundreds of "machine guns."

- Shooting in the leg can very easily kill someone via blood loss. Only someone with no actual knowledge of guns thinks that would work.
- Set phasers to stun.
Using an intermediate weapon in response to a lethal threat might work in scenarios where more than one officer is on scene and lethal force is readily available in the event the intermediate weapon fails to subdue.  Tasers are very effective when they work & they work best when the probes strike the posterior of the aggressor (electromuscular disruption on larger muscle groups). They don’t always work though. Thick clothing, a probe missing, probes being pulled out intentionally or dislodging from the subject rolling on the ground.  A lone officer is gambling with her life and the lives of others when she responds to a lethal threat with a less-lethal, intermediate weapon.  Pepper spray vs gun, Taser vs knife, or baton vs machete are all under-matched methods of setting an officer up for failure.
- Just shoot them in the leg.
Nicking or severing the femoral artery is a great way to rapidly bleed to death.  You’ve got one of these arteries in each leg.
 Shooting a smaller target (leg vs center mass of torso) under autonomous, fight or flight conditions (i.e. 30% bullet hit rate) has a greater chance of missing.  Police are typically reacting to a life threatening gesture when they draw and fire their weapon.  This is light years away from being at the firing range amongst peers, in total safety, shooting at a paper target that doesn’t preset a threat.
- The SFPD is shorthanded….and they are overwhelmed because of it.
Everyone is getting laid off..
Do the people actually want to hide their heads in the sand about what’s to come? Do the people actually believe that the criminals are going to respect gun laws?
It’s a bad robot until you get have your turn at being pistol whipped and robbed.
I suggest you all get the Citizen app so that you can see first hand what’s really going on.
- Robots empowered to kill . . . [Ominous music] What could possibly go wrong?
- skynet speedrun
- and if its raining?
- We as citizen will not have any vote.
- Most of the “robots” are cameras on small wheeled/tracked systems. They’re essentially an RC car with a GoPro.  Literally.
- Will… since I did not go to Oxford and study English, I am happy to be corrected, but you may want to revisit the title of your piece… Wouldn’t “SFPD authorized to use robots to kill suspects” (where it is clear that the SFPD is the possessor of the robot doing the killing) be better than “SFPD authorized to kill suspects using robots” (where the suspects are the possessors of the robot doing… something)?
- The opponents would rather stack the bodies of a few dead cops than deal with realities, as proven in Dallas. It’s really that simple.
- Ever thought of using a robot to subdue and capture a suspect alive? No? Why not? Who’s getting paid off for the stupid proposal?
- Blowing Smoke,
We as citizens will not have any vote so I hope the fault will hold a certain person liable.Where are they already using A.I ‘s (human looking robots)as personnel as law enforcement officers and prison guards. ?
- It’s just a way to get it approved eventually they will use it on citizens
- Added, I can see what the abandonment like tolerance can strike in a force of unwillingness of a tolerate in drug addiction causes to pain the crisis that not all users fall, to putting addiction is out of the picture, but now who’s target.
- Have the robot responsibility on a single officer controlling it, and use it just like the PD would use a sniper — as a tool to take out a serious threat, with the actual kill/no-kill decision made by the on-scene commander.
- Like many Californians, I’ve grown sick of those who value the well being of violent criminals over everyone else, and those who think our cops should only take knives to gunfights.
- rational roach…hey bootlicker did you see the arsenal of machine guns and assault rifles the SFPD has?
- Or send the robot up close andc subdue the suspect by nonlethal means.
- Have the governor be the one to approve the robot killings and have the governor have a live feed of such events. That way when someone is killed, it’s on the governor, and we have accountability .
- Governor Lepetomane: What the hell is this?
- Hedley Lamarr: This is the bill that will convert the state hospital for the insane into the William J. Le Petomane memorial gambling casino for the insane.
- Governor Lepetomane: [standing up proudly] Gentlemen, this bill will be a giant step forward in the treatment of the insane gambler
- Fentanyl has killed more people but its the robot we are really scared off. Virtual signaling 101.
- This is classic SF – “national politics in lieu of local politics”.
- This group will end up debating robot force policies for months; when in reality the likelihood of SFPD being approved by the BOS for a robot (much less additional recruitment!) in the next decade is infinitesimal.
- SF will emerge in two years with first-of-its-kind robot force policies — that will never be used — while local issues stagnate.
- For anyone with strong opinions here, I’m not arguing that robot force policies aren’t important/impactful, just that they shouldn’t be a priority for SF now.
- The article states that “SFPD has 17 robots” (directly after the photo of the Supes).  So that ship has sailed Plus a surprising number of heavy weapons (in second para of section entitled “What else is in the draft policy?).
- Thank you for catching my error!
- That said, I still feel my point stands – are policies governing the utilization of the 12 (still working out of 17) SFPD robots the top priority for either SFPD or BOS?
- It seems absurd and I agree with the virtue-signaling comment posted above.
- London Greed in 2020: “As a Black woman, I’m personally offended by what happened to George Floyd, and will do all in my power to hold our own police force accountable. 🤔
- London Greed in 2022: “Now that I’ve turned Union Square into a garrison (https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Nothing-says-holiday-cheer-like-San-Francisco-s-16707991.php ), installed a crooked DA, and cut off ease-of-access to COVID safety 😷💉 in the midst of a still-ongoing pandemic, how can I take one step further towards libertarian dystopia? Hmm? Prototype ED-209s, you say? I’ll sign for it!” 🤖🚔
- We can only hope these robots will enforce the law in a fair and balanced way, something the SFPD seems incapable of doing on both fronts.
- Fine. Fire the cops and train work-at-home citizens to man the robots then. No reason to employ ‘roid heads and arm them with weapons if they are not up to do the job.
- The power to use force via robot should not be assigned to all police officers, who can and do hide behind qualified immunity while taking actions not acceptable to the public they serve.  That should be a decision assigned to the police chief or someone acting in that capacity and no one else.  The police chief can be held accountable by the board without having to break through qualified immunity.
- We need to fully RE FORM our Police Departments, much like the Gangs of the 1800s who ran the first Fire Departments: https://www.coffeeordie.com/baltimore-fire-department-gangs Our current Police Departments are Corrupt Gangs of Killers, Looters and DO NOT SERVE OR PROTECT THE PEOPLE.
- Vote this down and reform the police departments like we did after the 1850s
- I feel that SFPD needs all the help it can get in order to help save lives. Both the publics and theirs. Times have changed. Why should a criminals life be more important than a cops?
- Killer robots! Just one more thing to be worried about.  There has to be strict usage policies, and specially trained operators, I’d go so far as to say teams of operators, in case one operator has some kind of mental breakdown.
- Dear San Francisco,
- Please do NOT approve this part of the draft.
- Sincerely,
Former resident concerned for your citizens
- “. . . human resources management system cannot track different types of work done by officers, so “there is no compelling reason to track in the suggested manner.” ”
- ???
- Ohhh, MAN! What a massive hair ball – so many probable underlying things to unpack, but let me start with just one question for now.
- How does a system’s inability to track different types of work (done by officers) determine that there’s no need to track that work?
- Just off the top of my head with a sledgehammer nod to a key word, d’ya *THINK* better programming could help?
- Poor reasoning deposited into complete sentences doesn’t improve the reasoning.
- Absolutely.  “We don’t want to follow the law because it would be annoying to rewrite our processes.”
- That’s not an excuse anyone should accept.
- I’d like to know, perhaps ahead of the vote, how various supervisors line-up on lethal robots.
- It’s hard for me to believe the ACLU is right when it claims a robot gives the cops less situational awareness, I would think the ability to have a a remote camera in an otherwise barricaded room would let the cops slow down and breathe and get things right before they start blazing
- But I would have asked SFPD for a list of incidents in the past ten years in which a lethal robot would have been better than the response that was provided and the particulars of events they anticipate where a lethal robot would be better than sending in surveillance robots and drones followed at sometime by cops
- I can see why lethal robots could be helpful, but they should have to provide strong evidence of that

- By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.
- The San Francisco Police Department is proposing a new policy that would give robots the license to kill, as reported earlier by Mission Local (via Engadget). The draft policy, which outlines how the SFPD can use military-style weapons, states robots can be “used as a deadly force option when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option.”
- As reported by Mission Local, members of the city’s board of supervisors rules committee have been reviewing the new equipment policy for several weeks. The original version of the draft didn’t include any language surrounding robots’ use of deadly force until Aaron Peskin, the dean of the city’s board of supervisors, initially added that “robots shall not be used as a Use of Force against any person.”
- However, the SFPD returned the draft with a red line crossing out Peskin’s addition, replacing it with the line that gives robots the authority to kill suspects. According to Mission Local, Peskin eventually decided to accept the change because “there could be scenarios where deployment of lethal force was the only option.” San Francisco’s rules committee unanimously approved a version of the draft last week, which will face the board of supervisors on November 29th.
- As outlined in the equipment policy, the SFPD currently has 17 remotely piloted robots but only 12 are functioning. In addition to granting robots the ability to use deadly force, the proposal also authorizes them for use in “training and simulations, criminal apprehensions, critical incidents, exigent circumstances, executing a warrant or during suspicious device assessments.”
- While most of the robots listed in the SFPD’s inventory are primarily used for defusing bombs or dealing with hazardous materials, newer Remotec models have an optional weapons system, and the department’s existing F5A has a tool called the PAN disruptor that can load 12-gauge shotgun shells. It’s typically used to detonate bombs from a distance. The department’s QinetiQ Talon can also be modified to hold various weapons. A weaponized version of the robot is currently used by the US Army and can equip grenade launchers, machine guns, or even a 0.50-caliber anti-materiel rifle.
- “SFPD’s need to deliver deadly force via robot would be a rare and exceptional circumstance”
- “SFPD has always had the ability to use lethal force when the risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers are imminent and outweigh any other force option available,” says SFPD officer Eve Laokwansathitaya in a statement to The Verge. “SFPD does not have any sort of specific plan in place as the unusually dangerous or spontaneous operations where SFPD’s need to deliver deadly force via robot would be a rare and exceptional circumstance.”
- The Dallas Police Department used a robot to carry out deadly force for the first time in 2016. It used a bomb disposal robot — the same Remotec F5A model owned by the SFPD — armed with an explosive device to kill a suspect who shot and killed five police officers and wounded several others. At the time, Dallas police chief David Brown said the department “saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was.”
- Last month, a report from The Intercept revealed that California’s Oakland Police Department was also considering letting shotgun-equipped Remotec F5A robots use deadly force. Shortly after the report came out, the Oakland PD announced on Facebook it decided against adding “armed remote vehicles to the department.” Meanwhile, a group of robot makers, including Boston Dynamics, signed a pledge not to weaponize their robots earlier this year.

- The decision to approve the use of the remote-controlled equipment followed a two-hour emotionally charged debate.
- Officials in San Francisco have voted to give the city’s police the power to use potentially lethal, remote-controlled robots in emergency situations.
- The 8-3 vote in favour of the move followed an emotionally charged two-hour debate and came despite strong objections from civil liberties and other police oversight groups in the city on the west coast of the United States.
- Supervisor Connie Chan, a member of the committee that forwarded the proposal to the full board, said she understood concerns over use of force but that “according to state law, we are required to approve the use of these equipments. So here we are, and it’s definitely not an easy discussion.”
- The San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) has said it does not have pre-armed robots and has no plans to arm robots with guns. But the department could deploy robots equipped with explosive charges “to contact, incapacitate, or disorient violent, armed, or dangerous suspect” when lives are at stake, SFPD Spokesperson Allison Maxie said in a statement.
- “Robots equipped in this manner would only be used in extreme circumstances to save or prevent further loss of innocent lives,” she said.
- The proposal had been amended before it was passed to clarify that officers would only be allowed to use robots after they had exhausted alternative force or de-escalation tactics or concluded they would not be able to subdue the suspect through those alternative means. Just a limited number of high-ranking officers have the power to authorise the use of robots as a deadly force option.
- San Francisco police currently have a dozen functioning ground robots, which are used to assess bombs or provide eyes in low visibility situations, according to the department. They were acquired between 2010 and 2017.
- A new California law came into effect this year requiring police and sheriff’s departments to inventory military-grade equipment and seek approval for their use, amid concern the militarisation of the police was creating a climate among law enforcement that encouraged excessive force.
- In a letter earlier this week, the San Francisco Public Defender’s office warned that granting police “the ability to kill community members remotely” went against the city’s progressive values. The office wanted the board to reinstate language barring police from using robots against any person in an act of force.
- On the other side of San Francisco Bay, the Oakland Police Department dropped a similar proposal after public backlash.
- The first time a robot was used to deliver lethal force in the US was in 2016 when Dallas police sent in an armed robot that killed a holed-up sniper who had killed five officers in an ambush.

- It’s official—the San Francisco Police Department now has the ability to use robots to kill people. The latest step towards turning actual, everyday life in America into an episode of Black Mirror comes after the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a vote with an 8-3 majority Tuesday night to allow city cops to use potentially lethal remote-controlled robots in law enforcement operations. In a statement, SFPD spokesperson Allison Maxie said the department doesn’t have any plans to arm robots with firearms, but they might use machines strapped with explosives “to contact, incapacitate, or disorient [a] violent, armed, or dangerous suspect” in life-and-death situations. “Robots equipped in this manner would only be used in extreme circumstances to save or prevent further loss of innocent lives,” Maxie added.

- Decision comes after heated debate as police oversight groups warn over further militarization of law enforcement
- Police in San Francisco will be allowed to deploy potentially lethal, remote-controlled robots in emergency situations. The controversial policy was approved after weeks of scrutiny and a heated debate among the city’s board of supervisors during their meeting on Tuesday.
- Police oversight groups, the ACLU and San Francisco’s public defender had urged the 11-member body to reject the police’s use of equipment proposal. Opponents of the policy said it would lead to further militarization of a police force already too aggressive with underserved communities. They said the parameters under which use would be allowed were too vague. Supporters argued that having these robots as an option in dangerous situations was necessary given what they see as an ever-increasing risk of a high-profile shooting hitting the city.
- The policy was approved with an amendment that specifies the circumstances in which robots can be used and clarifying that only high-ranking officers will be allowed to authorize deadly force.
- “I’m surprised that we’re here in 2022,” said Hilary Ronen, one of the supervisors at the Tuesday meeting. “We have seen a history of these leading to tragedy and destruction all over the world.”
- Even worse than I thought! Only three of us - myself, @shamannwalton and @DeanPreston voted against arming robots with weapons to kill. A damn shame.
- The San Francisco police department said that it had owned and used robots for tasks such as serving warrants for 11 years and that the department did not have pre-armed robots and had no plans to arm robots with guns. But the department could deploy robots equipped with explosive charges in specific situations such as active shooter incidents and suicide bombers, said David Lazar, San Francisco’s assistant police chief.
- “We have it as a tool [we can use] if we have time, have secured the scene and we weigh out if we want to risk lives or if can we send a robot,” said Lazar during the board of supervisors meeting.
- Lazar invoked the 2017 mass shooting during a country music festival in Las Vegas as an example of the kind of situation that could necessitate the use of a robot equipped with explosives. Opposing supervisors argued that the mention of the mass casualty was a scare tactic meant to get a “rubber stamp” on tools that could be disproportionately used against low-income Black and Latino residents. According to a San Francisco Chronicle analysis, Black people were nearly six times more likely to be stopped by police than white residents in 2020.
- “I can’t believe what I’m hearing … these kinds of tools will deepen the disparities in inflicting deadly force on communities,” said Dean Preston, a supervisor who represents San Francisco’s long-troubled Tenderloin neighborhood.
- The proposed policy does not lay out specifics for how the weapons can and cannot be equipped, leaving open the option to arm them. “Robots will only be used as a deadly force option when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers is imminent and outweighs any other force option available to SFPD,” it says.
- Despite the hyperbole expressed by many who oppose this policy, I believe it lays out reasonable restrictions on the use of robots, and I appreciate the work Rules Committee Chair @AaronPeskin and SFPD did to come to an agreement on this important issue. 5/5
- The vote comes under a new California state law that requires police and sheriffs departments to inventory military grade equipment and seek approval for its use. San Francisco police currently have a dozen functioning ground robots used to assess bombs or provide eyes in low visibility situations, the department says. They were acquired between 2010 and 2017.
- The state law was authored last year by the San Francisco city attorney, David Chiu, while he was an assemblymember. It is aimed at giving the public a forum and voice in the acquisition and use of military-grade weapons that have a negative effect on communities, according to the legislation.
- San Francisco police did not immediately respond to a question about how the robots were acquired, but a federal program has dispensed grenade launchers, camouflage uniforms, bayonets, armored vehicles and other surplus military equipment to help local law enforcement, according to the Associated Press.
- In 2017, Donald Trump signed an order reviving the Pentagon program after Barack Obama curtailed it in 2015, triggered in part by outrage over the use of military gear during protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the shooting death of Michael Brown.
- Like many places around the US, San Francisco is trying to balance public safety with treasured civilian rights such as privacy and the ability to live free of excessive police oversight. In September, supervisors agreed to a trial run allowing police to access in real-time private surveillance camera feeds in certain circumstances.
- Supporters of the police’s equipment use policy argue that San Francisco’s status as a major city that sees thousands of tourists and dozens of conventions annually also makes it a target for terrorism or high-profile mass shootings. To restrict the use of these robots could make the city seem like a “target”, said Matt Dorsey, another supervisor.
- “It terrifies me that it takes one person with evil in his heart to hear that San Francisco is unique in what we deny to our law enforcement agencies. God forbid we are depriving ourselves of something that can help public safety,” Dorsey continued. “I’m not comfortable making my city a target.”
- The Oakland police department across the San Francisco Bay dropped a similar proposal after public backlash.

- San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to bar police from using robots to kill, in a striking reversal that comes just a week after it gave law enforcement that right in a limited number of situations.
- The board had received widespread criticism after voting Nov. 29 to approve a police proposal authorizing law enforcement to deploy remote-controlled, ground-based robots to use deadly force when there is “imminent” risk to life and alternative measures to subdue the threat do not work.
- Officials on Tuesday also sent the issue back to a committee for additional review, leaving the policy open to future amendment.
- District Supervisor Dean Preston (D), who had voted against the measure last week, called the reversal “crucial.”
- “There have been more killings at the hands of police than any other year on record nationwide,” Preston said in a statement. “We should be working on ways to decrease the use of force by local law enforcement, not giving them new tools to kill people.”
- “Common sense prevailed,” said Supervisor Hillary Ronen (D), who had also originally opposed the measure.
- The San Francisco Police Department had called last week’s vote a “testament to the confidence” of officials and residents in law enforcement. Chief William Scott said after Tuesday’s vote that the debate around armed robots had been “distorted" to distract from the issue of law enforcement having necessary tools to save lives in an “active shooter or mass casualty incident.”
- “We want to use our robots to save lives – not take them,” he said in a statement to The Post. “To be sure, this is about neutralizing a threat by equipping a robot with a lethal option as a last case scenario, not sending an officer in on a suicide mission.”
- Dallas police used a robot to kill. What does that mean for the future of police robots?
- Officials had been required to vote on the policy because of a recent state law that requires police departments to seek approval from local officials for the use of military-grade equipment, the Associated Press reported.
- Militaries have long used unmanned devices to kill, but the debate over whether police can deploy killer robots first emerged in the United States after an incident in Dallas in 2016. After a lone gunman killed five officers in an extended standoff, police placed explosives on a robot and detonated the bomb to kill the shooter.
- The board’s vote last week sparked furious debate and angry protests from rights groups who were concerned about the “militarization” of law enforcement, which they argue would disproportionately affect communities of color, who are more likely to be killed in police encounters than White Americans.
- The proposal “is not a public safety solution, as the department claims, but an expansion of police power that history and common sense demonstrates will endanger lives needlessly,” reads a Dec. 5 letter from several Bay Area civil rights groups to Mayor London Breed (D) and the supervisors.
- Can police use robots to kill? San Francisco voted yes.
- The pressure seemed to have worked on board members such as Gordon Mar (D), who publicly switched his position ahead of Tuesday’s vote. Mar said Tuesday that he had grown “increasingly uncomfortable” with the precedent the policy would set for other cities and had decided to vote against it.
- San Francisco’s police department acquired robots between 2010 and 2017, which they said were primarily used during situations involving explosives or those requiring officers to keep distance while securing a site. They currently are not equipped to use lethal force.
- The department said that only a small number of high-ranking officials were authorized to deploy robots that could use lethal force. Scott, the police chief, had said that it would be used only as a “last resort option.”
