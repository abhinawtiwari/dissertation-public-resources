- Controversial podcaster Joe Rogan has had his identity stolen and deepfaked in a video ad to push Alpha Grind, a male enhancement product that markets itself as 'For Men with the Highest Expectations'.
- The video clip, which shows Rogan discussing Alpha Grind with guest Professor Andrew D. Huberman on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, sparked uproar on Twitter, with people noting that it is illegal to steal someone's identity to promote a product using AI.
- The fake ad was circulating freely on TikTok until it was spotted by Jimmy Farley and removed from the platform. It was also refuted by Huberman.
- Futurism notes that Rogan is known to push all manner of iffy products, some of them quietly owned by companies he owns outright or has invested in. But that doesn't detract from the fact that, in this instance, he is the victim.

- An internet scam featuring an AI version of controversial podcaster Joe Rogan has gone viral, terrifying the internet with its implications for the future of AI.
- AI has been taking over the internet recently, with chatbots like ChatGPT being widely discussed in the past few weeks. AI has started to spill more into the entertainment side of things too, with its recent invasion on Twitch in the form of nothingforever, a satirical parody of the 90’s show Seinfeld fully run by AI.
- Alongside this, AI has improved dramatically in recent times, with AI versions of streamers gaining traction as more and more of Twitch slowly becomes interested. Asmongold was one of the first to receive the AI treatment, and his AI counterpart left him utterly dumbfounded.
- Now, it appears that TikTok is also receiving AI treatment, as a Twitter post containing a TikTok scam went viral on February 12. The reason for its virality came through the method in which the ad used to convince viewers to buy the product, which was done through an AI version of controversial podcaster Joe Rogan.
- Deepfake scams are here, and we’re not ready. pic.twitter.com/NtPKWGCULi
- The ad sees Rogan discussing with another individual about libido supplements for men, in particular, a brand named “Alpha Grind”. Rogan spouts about the utility of the product, stating that it’s listed as one of the highest products on Amazon, quite literally saying “If you go to Amazon and type in Libido Booster for Men, you’re going to find it right at the top. Because guys are figuring out that it literally is increasing size and making a difference down there.”
- While the contents of the ad itself are rather hilarious, the fact is that Joe Rogan never spoke those words on his podcast. Instead, an AI-generated version of Joe Rogan’s voice was used for the advertisement, promoting the product for free without Rogan’s notice or consent. This has left the internet in a bit of a scared state.
- Twitter users have expressed their concerns about how far AI has come, as well as the accuracy with which Rogan was being portrayed in the ad.

- “We are all in trouble,” one user said. “That’s scarily real,” another added. “It’s definitely going to catch a lot of people.”
- The future sucks https://t.co/ZIfaOXI9p4
- However, some have taken it the other way, with one user even going so far as to improve further upon the ad. They attempted to make Rogan’s voice more authentic, to which Twitch streamer Hasan was not impressed, scolding them, “bro stop.”
- Time will only tell if AI continues to improve, but one thing for sure is that the internet is terrified of what may come in the future, considering the usage AI already has right now.

- Deeply depressing.
- We are in the early stages of seeing how AI technologies are going to change elements of the world, both online and in the meatspace, and so far the verdict is decidedly mixed. Big tech is betting that it will revolutionise things like search before bleeding into all aspects of how we communicate and engage with the world. But this is powerful and cutting-edge technology, which means one thing: Bad actors are going to try and exploit these things in any way they can.
- Deepfake videos have now been circulating online for a while; they are AI-generated clips where a person's image is superimposed over existing footage such that it looks indistinguishable from watching the real person. These clips are often accompanied by dire prognostications about how they'll be used in the future and now thanks to TikTok you can view one of the first widely spread examples.
- The platform is serving users a scam advert that features an AI-generated version of the enormously popular podcast host Joe Rogan. Rogan is a controversial figure for various reasons, but this ad is absolutely nothing to do with the real Joe Rogan, instead featuring an AI Rogan who discusses penis pills over a video that alternates between shots of 'Rogan' talking and a demonstration of how to buy said pills.
- The clip was brought to light by Coffeezilla, an investigator extraordinaire of the internet's murkiest corners—more recently, he's been embarrassing Logan Paul for the influencer's disastrous CryptoZoo project.
- Deepfake scams are here, and we’re not ready. pic.twitter.com/NtPKWGCULiFebruary 12, 2023
- Whatever you may think of Joe Rogan, he's the victim here, and I encourage everyone to watch this video just to see how convincing the scam is. The video sees the fake Rogan extolling the virtues of a product called 'Alpha Grind', talking about its bestseller status on Amazon, and talking in a conversational manner that, to my amateur ears, does mimic the presenter's delivery and style: "If you go to Amazon and type in Libido Booster for Men, you’re going to find it right at the top. Because guys are figuring out that it literally is increasing size and making a difference down there."
- I've contacted the real Joe Rogan for comment, and will update with any response.
- You would not blame anyone for thinking this is the real deal, and the implications of that are pretty horrendous. It is also notable that the cutting-edge of tech is here being deployed to sell depressed men penis pills: plus ça change.

- If you've been on TikTok lately, you might have been served a video advertisement featuring Joe Rogan and one of his guests on his immensely popular podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience. In the clip, Rogan boasts about a "libido booster for men" supplement called Alpha Grind, going so far as to tell listeners exactly what to type in to find the product on Amazon.
- Rogan is one of the most popular podcasters out there, with over ten million listeners per episode of his show. A brand endorsement like that would be a big get and likely a very expensive one for any product. Only Joe Rogan did not endorse Alpha Grind on his show. The clip featured in the TikTok video ad is a likely deepfake, an AI creation with the intent to make it appear as if Rogan endorsed the product in order to boost sales.
- The video ad was posted and promoted on TikTok by a user going by the name @mikesmithtrainer. When Mashable first reviewed the TikTok account, the publicly posted videos consisted of testimonial clips of supposed everyday Alpha Grind consumers. As of publishing time, the @mikesmithtrainer(opens in a new tab) account is no longer accessible on TikTok.
- A TikTok spokesperson confirmed to Mashable that the company "removed these videos under our harmful misinformation policy." TikTok also banned the account.
- On Twitter, user @JimmyFarley00 reposted(opens in a new tab) the fake Joe Rogan clip and the tweet instantly went viral. The Twitter video has been viewed more than 5 million times and a number of users in the tweet's replies reportedly saw the ad on TikTok when it was still live. However, as of Feb. 15, the suspected Rogan deepfake has also been removed from Twitter. When trying to view the video, users are met with a prompt that claims the clip has been removed due to "a report from the copyright owner." Mashable has included an upload(opens in a new tab) of the clip that is still live above.
- When first confronted with the suspected deepfake Rogan video, some Twitter users didn't even realize what they were looking out for at first. Andrew D. Huberman, the guest on Rogan's podcast who is also featured in the video, entered(opens in a new tab) the conversation to point out(opens in a new tab) to those users that the conversation showcased in the video never actually happened.
- "They created a false conversation," Huberman explained in the replies to the clip. "We were talking about something very different."
- In the clip, it's clear that some parts of the conversation are lifted from the podcast. The video is heavily edited and takes bits and pieces from the actual episode. The clip then also weaves what is likely completely fabricated AI deepfake audio and footage of Rogan endorsing the Alpha Grind product during their conversation, which — pending analysis from an expert — would mean the hoaxer used machine learning to replicate Rogan's voice and paired that with deceptive video editing or additional AI fakery to match-up his facial features to what he's saying.
- Deepfakes aren't new and have been worrying ethicists and disinformation experts for years now. However, there is a renewed interest in all things AI since OpenAI's impressive ChatGPT AI chatbot burst onto the scene showing just how much advancement has been made with machine learning technology.
- TikTok actually banned(opens in a new tab) deepfake videos on the platform back in 2020, however, it's unclear how much the policy is enforced. When Mashable reached out, a TikTok spokesperson highlighted the platforms Community Guidelines which disallow "Digital Forgeries (Synthetic Media or Manipulated Media) that mislead users by distorting the truth of events and cause significant harm to the subject of the video, other persons, or society."
- It should be noted that not all deepfakes are used for nefarious purposes, and that the technology can be used for creative videos meant to simply entertain viewers. However, deepfakes have been consistently thrust into the spotlight for their more negative use cases. Just last month, a popular Twitch streamer went viral after he mistakenly revealed(opens in a new tab) in a livestream that he purchased non-consensual deepfake porn of other Twitch streamers.
- Mashable has reached out to TikTok for more information on the Joe Rogan TikTok ad and the removal of the account that posted it. We will update this piece when we hear back.

- Joe Rogan is known to read a few sponsored ads at the beginning of his podcast, but a video of him promoting a libido booster for men is a deepfake - and people fear this is the start of new scams and a wave of misinformation.
- The 'eerily real' clip shows Rogan discussing the brand Alpha Grind with guest Professor Andrew D. Huberman on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, stating the product is all over TikTok and is available for purchase on Amazon.
- The 28-second video does look realistic, but some segments reveal it was created by artificial intelligence - some commentary jumps instead of naturally flowing.
- Huberman responded to the video on Twitter, saying: 'They created a false conversation. We never had. We were talking about something very different.'
- The deepfake has sparked an uproar on Twitter, with many users noting that it is illegal to recreate someone with artificial intelligence to promote a product.
- BREAKING: This AI deepfake video rendering of Joe Rogan is going viral on TikTok. This is the start of massive waves of new scams & misinformation!If only there was a decentralized GPU compute/rendering network that can authenticate provenance for IP. $RNDR https://t.co/m5WQvJjEuF pic.twitter.com/VqtQgEFcyJ
- The 'eerily real' clip shows Joe Rogan discussing the brand Alpha Grind with guest Professor Andrew D. Huberman on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast
- One user, amazed by the deepfake ad, said: 'Moderation for deepfakes will become more prevalent within the advertising realm soon. Bullish on advertisement monitoring software.'
- The clip shows Rogan and Huberman talking about the male enhancer that claims to increase testosterone, noting it 'increases the size and makes a difference down there.'
- The video pans to Amazon to show users where they can find  Alpha Grind - and the clip shows a 15 percent off coupon for the enhancer.
- DailyMail.com has contacted Rogan and Huberman for comment.
- Jimmy Farley shared the video on Twitter, noting it was his first time seeing a deepfake ad on TikTok.
- 'How tf is this legal?' he shared in his tweet.
- Rob Freund, a lawyer for brands, chimed in, sharing that the video is not legal.
- 'Your right of publicity protects against use of your name or likeness in an ad without your permission,' Freund shared in a tweet.
- The clip also shows users how to find Alpha Grind on Amazon
- And at least in California, you don't have to be a model or celebrity—everyone has a statutory right to recover for violations of their publicity rights. Separately, under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, false endorsement occurs when a person's identity is connected with a product or service in such a way that consumers are likely to be misled about that person's sponsorship or approval of the product or service.
- 'Here, Huberman's and Rogan's likenesses are used to endorse a product that they don't actually endorse, so both publicity and false endorsement issues are at play here.'
- The deepfake of Rogan is just one of many released to the masses - one in 2022 showed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thanking democrats for their 'service and inaction' on antitrust legislation.
- The eerie, convincing clip is the work of advocacy group Demand Progress Action, which used deepfake technology to turn an actor into Zuckerberg - who thanks Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for holding up two significant pieces of antitrust legislation this year.
- The deepfake of Rogan is just one of many released to the masses - one in 2022 showed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thanking democrats for their 'service and inaction' on antitrust legislation
- 'Over the past five years, Congress has held over 30 hearings designed to hold Big Tech accountable,' fake Zuckerberg says in the ad, which the liberal group plans to use for television ads in New York and Washington, D.C.
- 'Sometimes you land a punch.'
- And in March 2021, deepfake Tom Cruise took over TikTok.
- An account appeared on the app, dubbed 'deeptomcruise,' which shows a number of videos depicting Cruise doing a magic trick, playing golf and reminiscing about the time he met the former President of the Soviet Union.
- While these videos are for entertainment, deepfakes pose security threats.
- Dr Tim Stevens, director of the Cyber Security Research Group at King's College London, said deepfake AI - which can create hyper-realistic images and videos of people - had the potential to undermine democratic institutions and national security.
- Stevens said states like Russia could exploit the widespread availability of these tools to 'troll' target populations to achieve foreign policy objectives and 'undermine' the national security of countries.
- He added: 'The potential is there for AIs and deepfakes to affect national security.
- 'Not at the high level of defence and interstate warfare but in the general undermining of trust in democratic institutions and the media.
- 'They could be exploited by autocracies like Russia to decrease the level of trust in those institutions and organizations.'

- An advertisement featuring a deepfaked Joe Rogan is being used to promote a scientifically dubious brand of male enhancement product on TikTok, a worrying use of the technology that looks and sounds far too convincing for our liking.
- Initially uncovered by TikTok ad strategist Jimmy Farley, the ad features an AI version of the infamous podcaster, who is being made to shill an allegedly libido-boosting maca root powder that, per the video's phony Rogan, is "literally increasing size and making a different down there."
- "My first time seeing a deepfake ad in the wild on TikTok," Farley wrote. "How tf is this legal?"

- To the untrained eye and ear, this video looks and sounds just like the real Rogan, especially considering he's wont to sling all kinds of snake oil, including products produced by Onnit, a supplement company he co-owns.
- But if you listen closely, you can detect the robotic tone characteristic of AI-generated speech, a special kind of soullessness that makes it so uncanny.
- Unfortunately, if this video appeared in the endless scroll of a Rogan fan's TikTok feed, they likely wouldn't be paying close enough attention to recognize it as a fake right away.
- While it's pretty hilarious on its face that someone is using AI to impersonate a podcaster known for his unique blend of libertarianism, New Age BS, and comedic devil's advocacy, the fact remains that using another's likeness to sell a product without their consent is illegal — even if the person in question tried to convince his followers to eat horse dewormer to prevent COVID-19.
- As PCGamer argued, Rogan is indeed the victim here, whether you like the guy or not. After all, neither he nor anyone else deserves to have their identity stolen — especially in such a dystopian manner.
