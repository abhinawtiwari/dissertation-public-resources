- A Tesla Model S blew through a three-way intersection, hit a Chevrolet Tahoe pick-up truck, causing it to spin, hit and kill a pedestrian. The woman, Naibel Benevides Leon, was thrown 70-80 feet into nearby woods whilst her companion was badly injured.
- Police investigators said the Tesla's Autopilot driver-assist function appeared to be switched on, and that driver George McGee had dropped his phone, looked down, and ran a stop sign. In May 2021, Naibel Benevides' estate sued Tesla, accusing it of designing a 'defective and unsafe' car that failed to detect the Chevy Tahoe even though it was parked directly in front of the Tesla.

- Investigators probing a fatal crash involving a 2019 Tesla Model S that killed a pedestrian on Card Sound Road in April are looking into whether the car’s semi-autonomous driver function was engaged when it blew through an intersection and killed the woman, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
- The car didn’t stop at a three-way stop sign intersection, where the road becomes County Road 905, and plowed into a Chevrolet Tahoe pickup truck that was parked on the east-side shoulder of the road, causing it to spin and hit the woman, Benevides Leon Naibel, 22, launching her about 82 feet into the woods on April 25 around 9:15 p.m.
- A man who was standing with Naibel, Angulo Dillion, 27, was seriously injured and airlifted to Jackson Memorial South Hospital.
- FHP spokesman Lt. Alejandro Camacho said the agency’s traffic homicide investigators are trying to determine if the driver, George McGee, 42, was in complete control of the car at the time, or if the all-electric vehicle’s Navigate on Autopilot was turned on. McGee was on his way to the exclusive Ocean Reef gated community that night, according to a sheriff’s deputy’s body camera footage released to FLKeysNews.com Friday.
- The accident is still under investigation, Camacho said in an email Wednesday, replying with a “yes” when asked in a follow-up question if the autopilot function is part of the probe.
- Navigate on Autopilot is a semi-autonomous advanced driver-assist system that allows the car to drive itself in many instances as long as the driver’s hands are on the wheel. An alert is sounded if the system detects the driver’s hands are removed from the wheel, according to the National Transportation Safety Administration.
- The system is part of Tesla’s goal to develop completely driverless cars by 2020, but the realization of that objective could be in doubt as Navigate on Autopilot was found to have been engaged in several fatal highway crashes involving Teslas since the feature was introduced in 2014, including one in March in Delray Beach.
- Tesla did not return a request for comment on the Keys crash.
- McGee’s attorney Mike Tein declined to respond to a specific question asking if his client’s car’s Autopilot was engaged before the April crash.
- “This was a tragic car accident. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families. Right now, while FHP is still working on its report, it wouldn’t be right for us to comment on the particulars,” Tein said.
- According to FHP Cpl. David Riso’s probable cause affidavit for a search warrant for the Tesla, Monroe County Deputy Joel Torres was the first law enforcement officer at the scene. His body camera footage recorded McGee “spontaneously” telling Torres “that he was driving, he had dropped his phone, looked down, ran the stop sign and hit the victim’s car,” Riso wrote in his report.
- McGee got out of his car and immediately tended to Dillion, but he did not know Naibel was in the woods, according to Riso’s report. Her body wasn’t found until more than 10 minutes after medics arrived. Torres’ body camera footage captured the tense moment when witnesses and first responders noticed her in the tree line.
- About a minute before she was found, Torres suspected there was another person involved in the wreck when a witness at the scene began yelling there were lady’s flip flops underneath the truck. As Torres looks around the truck, McGee can be heard saying, “Please tell me no,” as he approaches the deputy, who told him to “get back.”
- Almost two minutes later, the woman can be heard saying, “She’s right there. She’s right there in the bushes.” When Torres gets to the scene, a firefighter crouching beside her body says she’s not breathing.
- McGee told Torres the car was on “cruise control” when he dropped the phone. He was on his way to Ocean Reef to pick someone up and was speaking with an airline because he was planning to fly out of town for a funeral the next day.
- “And, when I popped up, I saw a black truck,” McGee said. “It happened so fast.”
- Police say there was no indication McGee was drinking. He said he was not, and was coming straight from work in Boca Raton to Ocean Reef.
- Riso stated in his report that McGee never hit the brakes before hitting the Tahoe.
- “The 2019 Tesla did not leave any surface marks, tire marks or skid marks on the roadway surface as it traveled across the travel lanes of County Road 905. This is a clear indication the driver did not brake nor attempt to brake,” Riso wrote.
- In the warrant affidavit, Riso seeks the Tesla’s event data recorder, which is “designed to record data related to vehicle dynamic and safety systems when the system senses a crash or a crash-like situation, such as hitting a road obstacle.”
- The warrant also seeks “any information that will determine if the vehicle was in auto drive mode or cruise control,” Riso wrote.
- Less than a month after the crash that killed Naibel, another woman was killed on Card Sound Road when she drifted into oncoming traffic and directly into the path of a Miami-Dade transit bus. Shakeenah Telishah Bullard, 38, was pronounced dead at the scene of the May 14 crash.
- The recent deaths have placed pressure on Miami-Dade and Monroe County officials to do more to make Card Sound Road, which goes through both counties, safer. Many people who work in the Keys take the road, especially those who work at the exclusive Ocean Reef gated community.
- The other entryway into the Keys — and the more frequently traveled and direct — is the 18 Mile Stretch from Florida City to Key Largo.
- Claude Kershner, owner of Reef Tropical Pool and Landscaping, which has many clients in Ocean Reef, heads a task force of other business owners and Ocean Reef members urging quick action on the road.
- “Aside from my prayers for those involved, the pressure today is dramatically increased for a plan for the future,” he said in a May 14 email to Miami-Dade officials in response to the bus crash.
- The county’s Department of Transportation and Public Works commissioned a $69,593 “feasibility study” earlier this year looking into options like widening the two-lane road and providing pedestrian and bicycle lanes on the side, said Jennie Lopez, a spokesman for the department.
- She said Miami-Dade has had no discussions with its transportation counterparts in Monroe.
- Monroe County spokeswoman Kristen Livengood said in an email Thursday that “the county is aware of concerns on Card Sound Road and [the departments of] Transportation and Planning are looking into ideas to address them.”
- She added that the county is in discussions with the Florida Department of Transportation about the possibility of conducting a “transportation master plan” Monroe-wide evaluation that would include Card Sound Road in the study.
- Since 2015, there have been four fatal crashes on Card Sound Road in Miami-Dade, Lopez said. The narrow highway has become the more dangerous route in and out of the Keys ever since FDOT installed a concrete barrier separating northbound and southbound traffic on the 18 Mile Stretch eight years ago.
- Asked whether there is any talk of placing a similar barrier that would separate oncoming traffic on Card Sound Road, Christine Hurley, assistant Monroe County administrator, said it’s too soon to say.
- “The study would determine options,” Hurley said. “We haven’t gotten to that yet.”
- The barrier on the stretch was completed in 2011, as part of a $330 million overhaul of the highway. Before it was installed, an average of five to seven people died on the the stretch every year, according to FDOT. Although a Key Largo man died in February in a single-vehicle crash after the SUV in which he was a passenger struck the barrier and flipped, road fatalities on the stretch are now rare.

- A man who survived a Florida car crash that killed his girlfriend is demanding the driver of a Tesla Model S is prosecuted after he was allowed to go free from the crash site, telling police his Tesla had been driving in cruise.
- George McGee from Boca Raton is heard on bodycam saying he was coming from his office when he blew through a stop sign and a red light before hitting a stop sign and then the couple's truck, which was parked 40 feet off the road.
- Dillon Angulo, 27, is seen being worked on by emergency responders in the video released by officials and they are heard communicating that Naibel Benavides Leon, 22, was thrown into the bushes due to the force of the Tesla that hit as they stood outside their truck where Card Sound Road intersects with County Road 905.
- McGee is later heard telling cops he was driving in 'cruise', which Tesla calls their Traffic Aware Cruise Control.
- Dillon Angulo, 27, and girlfriend Naibel Benavides Leon, 22, were standing outside their truck when it was hit by George McGee's Tesla in April
- McGee told cops he was driving in 'cruise', he took his hand off the wheel to get his dropped cell phone and then hit the truck. Cops asked how much he had drunk and he said nothing but officials didn't test for DUI
- The cruise feature helps drivers maintain a safe distance from the car in front, automatically breaks and carries out lane control.
- But McGee also tells officers he was retrieving a cell phone that fell just before the fatal accident.
- He says on video that he took his hands off the wheel and that's when things went awry.
- McGee said: 'I reached down, I didn't see it and when I popped up, I saw a black truck just happened so fast.'
- However police allowed McGee to leave the scene of the collision without testing him for driving under the influence of drugs of alcohol. They simply ask how much he had been drinking and McGee claims nothing.
- This despite the fact that authorities noted in the post-incident report that McGee was driving in a 'reckless or aggressive manner.'
- Tesla (pictured) Traffic Aware Cruise Control claims to help drivers maintain safe distance from the car in front, automatically break and with lane control
- Leon was thrown into the bushes by the force of the Tesla and she later died in hospital
- Angulo continued that he thought he was going to die at one point and added: 'It has been rough'
- Leon later died in hospital - a tragedy her partner only found out weeks after the crash. He still uses a wheelchair and suffered memory loss.
- Monroe County State Attorney hasn't filed any charges against McGee. They have discussed the incident with Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) as they investigate.
- But as FHP refuses to say why McGee wasn't tested at the crash scene, Angulo has been left fuming.
- He recalled learning about what happened in April, called it 'devastating' and said he was 'overwhelmed with sadness'.
- 'How can somebody be free three months after they've killed somebody and have caused so much pain in other people's lives,' Angulo told NBC 6 on Saturday. 'To me, that's not right.'
- Angulo continued that he thought he was going to die at one point and added: 'It has been rough.'
- Leon's family has said 'they remain resolute and determined in their efforts to ensure both criminal and civil justice are served'.
- Meanwhile the dead woman's boyfriend's attorney called the whole thing 'a slap in the face to these victims'.
- 'Mr. McGee's conduct that evening was not only remarkably selfish, irresponsible, reckless,' Rob Pelier told NBC 6. 'In my belief, it was criminal.'
- Monroe County State Attorney hasn't filed any charges against McGee and Florida Highway Patrol won't say why he wasn't tested. But incident report stated McGee blew through red light, and hit a stop sign before striking the couple's vehicle which was parked 40 feet off Card Sound Road by County Road 905
- Angulo's attorney called it 'a slap in the face' and the survivor asked: 'How can somebody be free three months after they've killed somebody?'

- It's been almost four months since a crash claimed the life of a Miami woman and seriously injured her boyfriend.
- Dillon Angulo, 27, and Naibel Benavides Leon, 22, were standing outside of their truck parked off Card Sound Road when they were hit by a car.
- The video from a Monroe County deputy's body worn camera shows rescue efforts to save Angulo, who was lying unconscious with blood around him.
- "Look at me, look at me," a paramedic can be heard telling him.
- The impact of the crash threw Benavides Leon into the bushes - where she was found by paramedics minutes later. She died after being transported to the hospital.
- Dillon says he spent weeks in the hospital with serious injuries.
- "They thought I was going to die at one point," said Angulo during an exclusive interview with NBC 6. "It's been rough."
- 
- He says he had a traumatic brain injury that has affected his memory. He says he doesn't remember the crash. But he remembers when he was told weeks later about the crash and that his girlfriend had died.
- "At that moment finding out that my girlfriend passed away and I was in a severe accident was devastating," he said. "I was just overwhelmed with sadness."
- Florida Highway Patrol is investigating the crash - which happened where Card Sound Road intersects with County Road 905, a popular route for people travelling to the Keys.
- According to the FHP accident report, the driver of a 2019 Tesla Model S ran through a stop sign, a flashing red stop light and knocked down a traffic sign all before colliding into the couple, whose truck was parked 40 feet off the road.
- The driver, George McGee from Boca Raton, can be heard on the body worn camera that he was driving in "cruise."
- McGee could be referring to an optional feature that Tesla promotes on its website called "Traffic Aware Cruise Control," which allows the car to maintain a safe distance from the car in front.
- It's one of many autopilot features that could come with the Tesla S. Others include automatic breaking and lane control.
- FHP is investigating what if any autopilot features were in use at the time of the crash.
- McGee can also be heard telling police he took his hands off the wheel to pick up a phone he dropped.
- "I reached down, I didn't see it and when I popped up, I saw a black truck just happened so fast," he said.
- McGee was allowed to leave the crash site that night without getting a ticket even though the police report lists that he operated the vehicle in a "reckless or aggressive manner."
- He wasn't tested for alcohol or drugs either. FHP declined to comment on why and any other details of the crash saying the investigation is ongoing.
- Angulo says he is angry because McGee hasn't faced any consequences.
- "How can somebody be free three months after they've killed somebody and have caused so much pain in other people's lives," Angulo said. "To me, that's not right."
- His attorney Rob Pelier echoes Angulo's frustration.
- "It's a slap in the face to these victims," he said. "Mr. McGee's conduct that evening was not only remarkably selfish, irresponsible, reckless and in my belief, it was criminal."
- The family of Benavides Leon declined to speak with NBC 6 but their lawyer, Todd Poses, wrote in a statement "they remain resolute and determined in their efforts to ensure both criminal and civil justice are served."
- The Monroe County State Attorney hasn't filed any charges against McGee but said it recently met with FHP to discuss the crash.
- McGee declined our request for an interview but his lawyer said it was a tragic accident and that their thoughts are with the families.

- The Maldonado family is suing Tesla after one of the company’s vehicles failed to detect and react to traffic conditions — causing 15-year-old high school student Jovani Maldonado to be killed in his father’s truck.
- The surviving victims want accountability from the company for the star feature of Tesla’s electric vehicles, which enables passengers to enjoy hands-free driving, The New York Times reported.

- There are about two dozen active investigations regarding crashes caused by passengers who drove Tesla vehicles using the Autopilot function, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA).
- Autopilot is not autonomous, meaning the vehicle is not driving by itself, but rather using software cameras and sensors to prevent human drivers from making common errors to prevent accidents, even if it means changing lanes. The feature was designed to help drivers who are prone to mistakes and distracted driving; it was not intended to drive people to their destinations, according to a Tesla forum post.

- Since 2016, there have been at least three Tesla drivers who died in crashes where Autopilot failed to detect things on the road, such as a concrete barrier, and did not brake in time to prevent a collision. In total, at least 10 people have been killed in eight accidents caused by Autopilot from 2016, according to the NHSTA, not including a 2019 crash that is the subject of the most recent lawsuit. Roughly 40,000 traffic fatalities occur each year in the U.S.
- There are several pending lawsuits currently filed against Tesla. One case, Naibel Benavides Leon v. Tesla, involved a 22-year-old driver who crashed into a parked Chevrolet Tahoe after their Model S failed to stop at a T intersection while the Autopilot feature was on. A suit filed in May by Darel Kyle, 55, claims he suffered serious spinal injuries when his van was rear-ended by.
- Other car manufacturers such as General Motors or Ford Motor have modeled their electric vehicles to steer them away from the same mistakes Tesla has made. For example, GM’s Super Cruise shuts down and requires the driver to take the wheel after drivers ignore repeated warnings to keep their eyes on the road.
