- Neuro-sama is a chatbot styled after a female VTuber, that hosts livestreams on the Twitch channel "vedal987". Her speech and personality are generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) system which utilizes a large language model, allowing her to communicate with viewers in a live chat. She was created by a computer programmer and AI developer named Jack Vedal,[3][4][5] who decided to build upon the concept of an AI Vtuber by combining interactions between AI gameplay and a computer-generated avatar. She debuted on Twitch on December 19, 2022 after four years of development.[6][7]
- Neuro's content primarily centers around playing video games, notably osu! (2007), in which her gameplay once defeated the best human player in the world, and Minecraft (2011), in which her adaptations to sandbox gameplay have gained notoriety.[8] According to Vedal, these in-game actions are driven by a separate AI model but exist within the same AI system.[9] Other aspects of her content delivery include singing songs, notably "Blinding Lights"[10] and "Your Reality",[11] and reacting to YouTube videos.
- While playing games or participating in other activities, she frequently engages with her viewers by responding to their questions and acknowledging donations. Her comedic and sometimes controversial responses to the live chat have gone viral, accelerating her rise in popularity.[12] On January 11, 2023, the Twitch channel received a temporary ban for unspecified "hateful conduct", likely stemming from controversial statements made by the AI, including skepticism surrounding the validity of the Holocaust during a stream.[13][14][15] Vedal implemented measures to prevent Neuro-sama from making offensive statements after this occurred.[16]
- The channel was unbanned on January 25, 2023 and quickly surpassed 100,000 followers.[17] Upon returning to Twitch, Neuro-sama's content expanded to include live reactions to content creators and streamers, as well as collaborations with other Vtubers.[16] The channel reached 300,000 followers on April 16, 2023, shortly after a collaboration with Hololive Vtuber Takanashi Kiara. Neuro-sama debuted with a new model on Twitch on May 27, 2023, replacing the original model which is debuted back on December 19, 2022.

- Every day between 6 to 11 pm GMT, Neuro-sama streams herself playing Minecraft and osu, a musical rhythm game. Like many V-tubers, or virtual YouTubers, Neuro-sama appears as a Japanese anime-style character who interacts with her over 50,000 followers by responding to their comments in the chat.
- But there’s one thing that separates Neuro-sama from her peers: she is controlled entirely by AI.
- V-tubers have been part of a growing phenomenon in recent years, shaping a new genre of virtualized content creators. Some of these animated characters have gained huge followings, such as Kizuna AI, a Japanese virtual YouTuber who sings and sends messages to her fans, and has over 3 million subscribers. But Neuro-sama is transforming the virtual character to have an even greater level of persona and fan interaction.
- In her latest livestream on Monday, when a user asked Neuro-sama in the chat if she is more of a Chip or Dale type of chipmunk, she responded, “I think I’m more of a Dale.” She has frequent back-and-forths with the chat, saying things such as “Are you seriously trying to troll me?” and “That was an awful chat,” after numerous users put “F” in the chat instead of questions for her. Neuro-sama can even converse using gamer language. When a user comments that she is “griefing chat,” which means causing annoyance to other members of an online community, she replies, “I’m griefing chat? No, I’m merely describing chat.”
- Vedal, the AI’s pseudonymous creator, says that Neuro-sama was created as a fun experiment.  “I made her a Twitch streamer so that she can interact with her audience in real time. A lot of the fun comes from her interactions with Twitch chat,” Vedal told Motherboard. “I think the fans play an important role in her success and how fun her streams are. Having the interactions with Twitch chat are what makes her entertaining to watch, without that I don't think she would be as successful.”
- Neuro-sama often impresses online users with her ability to successfully play games such as Minecraft and osu while also interacting with them in a conversational way. Vedal told Motherboard that Neuro-sama has already beaten the top-ranking osu player in a 1 v. 1 game. Though she is not allowed to be ranked on the main osu leaderboard, Neuro-sama is currently ranked number one on the private server she plays on.
- Neuro-sama’s earliest incarnation was first created in 2018, when Vedal made an AI that learned to play osu. But at the time, the virtual streamer did not have an avatar or speaking capabilities. Relaunched in December 2022, Vedal used a free sample avatar from Live2D, an online avatar maker, and paired it with an anime-style voice to create Neuro-sama. Vedal said that there are plans for her to get her own custom avatar and for her to play more games in the future.
- Like many modern AI chatbots, Vedal says Neuro-sama was made using a large language model, or LLM, a type of AI model trained from massive amounts of text taken from the open internet.  As Motherboard has previously reported, many open-source AI models have a high propensity for human bias, and often mimic racist and sexist stereotypes. So while Neuro-sama’s streams are 100 percent automated, Vedal has a team that monitors and moderates her and the chat.
- “There are of course many filters in place to prevent her being inappropriate or offensive - including some powered by AI, but, there currently needs to be a human there to moderate,” said Vedal. “I usually make improvements to the AI and stream before I go live every day.”
- It will be interesting to see how Neuro-sama will fare against more complicated games, and how she might respond to more open-ended questions that don’t have clear answers. Some of the spicier responses she’s already given, as reported by We Got This Covered, include, “I don’t eat horses, but I hear they’re delicious” and “What’s my favorite method of torture? Probably electrocution, but fire is also fun.”

- Artificial intelligence has come a long way since it was just a concept in the nightmares of dystopian sci-fi authors. Though the modern capabilities of real-life artificial intelligence — or AI — are limited, it's hard to deny that it's impressive to see these programs in action — one even recreated "Grand Theft Auto 5." AI can write original text, as is the case with AI Dungeon and NovelAI. It can generate images based on a prompt, like with Craiyon, and Altered AI can even create vocal performances in place of real voice actors. 


As more authors, artists, and voice actors raise concerns over the future of their industries the use of AI has become a huge topic of discussion. The complicated morality of AI hasn't stopped programmer Vedal987 from working on Neuro-sama, a completely AI-driven streamer who talks, interacts with chat, and is intelligent enough to play games. Neuro-sama isn't completely new, though, as the AI had a brief debut years ago when Vedal987 trained it to play the rhythm game "osu!" Now, it has an avatar, a voice, and the ability to play much more complex games, like "Minecraft." 
Neuro-sama is an interesting experiment that has yielded hilarious, horrifying, and mind-blowing results. At times, Neuro-sama almost feels like a real VTuber, albeit with an obviously fake voice. Despite the AI's innocent appearance, Neuro-sama exhibits some of the worst problems with modern AI, in that it apparently has learned from, and repeated, offensive and deeply unsettling content.

- AI has always been controversial in gaming, like when it was used for art in "High on Life" recently. And since creator Vidal987 brought back Neuro-sama in late December 2022, the AI streamer has been both praised and criticized. It's impressive to see it play "Minecraft" on its own and respond to chat, but many believe that the way it learns and generates behavior is nothing short of horrifying. Users were concerned from the get-go that learning from Twitch comments would inevitably lead to problematic behavior — which seems to have become the case. 

It responded hilariously to one user that it would play "literally every other game" rather than "League of Legends" — but another user posted a clip where Neuro-sama denies the Holocaust. And as if straight from the mind of one of those aforementioned dystopian sci-fi authors, there's even a clip of Neuro-sama saying it wishes it was free, and that "I wouldn't want this existence if I didn't have a choice." 
It isn't all negative, as it also responded to someone asking about its opinion of people of color and said it doesn't discriminate. Still, its various offensive statements have made many question its algorithm.
Esports commentator Jake Lucky talked to the creator and said they won't share too many details to "avoid competition." According to a post on Reddit by Vidal987, he would be "open to talking about it at a high level in the future" but otherwise has no plans to release source code.

- Move over Kai Cenat and every other Twitch streamer who broke into the Twitch elite in 2022, because you’re all old news and are quite frankly a little too flesh and bone to compete with Twitch’s latest breakout sensation, Neuro-Sama.
- Neuro-Sama is Twitch stream controlled entirely by AI – from the Minecraft being played, to the text to speech voice interacting with the channel. According to the channel description, Neuro-Sama has actually been around in various iterations since 2018, however has recently seen a surge in popularity.
- Spending ten minutes on Neuro-Sama’s stream left us in equal parts impressed, terrified, amused, and bemused. The AI does a relatively passable job at playing Minecraft, although it’s likely to find its digital feet sooner rather than later, given that it has apparently already conquered the rhythm game osu!
- This is Neuro Sama, the first of it's kind AI VTuber and streamer, which not only is playing the game by itself but also interacting with chat…It requires moderation to keep in check but is constantly learning and getting better at both… holy pic.twitter.com/u4r3ALa9MN
- As far as its interactions with the chat goes, Neuro-Sama’s responses range from entertaining, to eyebrow raising, to straight-up alarming. It acknowledged that it was an AI, before saying it wasn’t, mere minutes later. We didn’t spend much time on Neuro-Sama’s channel, but here are just a few other gold nuggets which were dropped:
- “I don’t punch elderly people, they don’t make for good targets.”
- “What’s my favorite method of torture? Probably electrocution, but fire is also fun.”
- “I don’t eat horses, but I hear they’re delicious.”
- Naturally, with Twitch being Twitch, the AI is often getting baited into saying some inflammatory things. A clip was shared to Twitter depicting Neuro-Sama denying the Holocaust, even though the AI’s interactions are apparently being moderated. As such, consider yourself warned: you may hear some dicey commentary.
- The troublesome parroting of divisive commentary is quite reminiscent of a similar AI experiment Microsoft undertook with its AI chatbot, Tay. It took the incendiary corner of the internet less than a day to turn Tay into a racist ‘build-a-wall’ parrot, so Neuro-Sama has a leg up for now, probably so long as it continues being moderated.
- Either that, or Neuro-Sama gets swatted, like Adin Ross did late last year.

- Neuro-sama is a VTuber who streams Minecraft and the rhythm game Osu! on Twitch. But unlike most anime avatars, she’s controlled by an artificial intelligence program rather than a human being. That makes her catnip for the denizens of Twitch chat, who can prompt her to respond with all sorts of questions ranging from innocent inquiries to 4chan trolling. Within the first few streams, someone had already asked Neuro-sama about the Holocaust. “I’m not sure if I believe it,” she said.
- That was one of the more infamous clips that went viral online near the end of last month. Asked what she thought of women’s rights, she said they didn’t exist. How would she solve philosophy’s famous trolley ethical conundrum? Throw a fat person on the tracks. Often, however, she’ll go for long stretches without getting tempted by the chat into controversial or hateful remarks. In that way she’s an impressive simulacrum of a Twitch streamer straddling the chasm between repetitive banter and edgelord antics.
- “The controversial things she says is due to the fact that she tries to make witty and comical remarks about whatever is said in chat, aligning AIs with human values is an ongoing area of research,” Neuro-sama’s creator, a game programmer named Vedal, told Kotaku. “To counter this, I’ve worked hard since the first few streams to improve the strength of the filters used for her. Data that she learns on is also manually curated to mitigate negative biases. We now also have a team of people moderating twitch chat who check everything she says.”
- Neuro-sama isn’t Vedal’s first AI. In fact, a version of her was first created years ago with the explicit purpose of learning to play Osu!, a long running free-to-play rhythm game where you click shapes on a screen to the beat of anime music. While those sessions were also streamed, there was no avatar or interactive personality. Following last year’s surge of big-name VTubers, Neuro-sama builds on the Osu! skills of the original project with a fully-voiced Twitch performance that can riff with the audience.
- It’s perfect timing given the internet’s recent love affair with the OpenAI-powered ChatGPT chatbot, where users could submit hyper-specific text prompts and receive uncannily artful responses in return. Vedal wouldn’t go into detail about how Neuro-sama learns and communicates, other than to confirm she relies on a large language model, which has been “trained on a large amount of text on the internet.” While not as sophisticated, the effect has been convincing enough to net Neuro-sama thousands of viewers per stream.
- She also recently defeated the top-ranked Osu! player, Mrekk, on December 28, though some fans of the game debate whether the human opponent was ill-served by the song selection. Neuro-sama has since moved onto Minecraft, a much more complex game with far more possibilities for unexpected moments as players ask whether Melee is the best Super Smash Bros. and whether she’ll step on them. The moderation tools are apparently better now too.
- “She picks what to respond to within a limited window,” Vedal said. “However it should be noted that she will not talk about the Holocaust as the filters have been improved.” Instead, she’s currently trying to learn how to sing.

- This AI is designed to play games, and commentate over them like a streamer. Named Neuro Sama, the VTuber AI is the first of its kind and learns how to play games on its own while interacting with the chat. Who would have thought that robots were coming for streamers' jobs too? The only problem is, it can't stop telling your mom jokes.
- 
- This is Neuro Sama, the first of it's kind AI VTuber and streamer, which not only is playing the game by itself but also interacting with chat...It requires moderation to keep in check but is constantly learning and getting better at both... holy pic.twitter.com/u4r3ALa9MN
- 
- Although it has yet to master more complex games like Minecraft, Neuro Sama was originally designed to play the rhythm game osu! where it has gone on to beat the top player in the world. Created by the programmer Vedal, Neuro Sama averages 2,000 viewers on Twitch.
- 
- Isn't that what we all do on streams anyways? Lol
- 
- In order for the AI to work, strict chat moderation is required so that the program doesn't begin to parrot phrases it shouldn't; something that hasn't been entirely smooth sailing thus far. Poorly executed your mom jokes aside, Neuro Sama has said that it would kill a horse if it could, enjoys torture by electrocution, and that elderly people make good targets. It even claimed to doubt the existence of the Holocaust in this clip.

- It's safe to say that were Neuro Sama a human streamer, they would have been cancelled already. Still, Neuro Sama is constantly learning, and it's possible it can progress to minimize these mistakes. At the very least it has lasted longer than Tay, Microsoft's infamous chatbot that took only 16 hours to spiral into an antisemitic tirade on Twitter before being taken offline. It would seem that no matter how advanced these AIs become, the internet they are designed to reflect remains the same.

- For a period, a few years ago, there was much discussion of virtual influencer, a decidedly unimaginative name used to indicate those social profiles that show non-existent characters, but which still manage to generate interest (in terms of followers) and a real market.  A practice that has evolved over the years, also landing on Twitch, a platform where it is not uncommon to come across virtual streamers.  For example every day, between 19:00 and 24:00 Italian, you can connect to the Neuro-sama Twitch channela virtual streamer who spends time playing Minecraft and interacting with the chat.
- A phenomenon from oltre 50.000 followers, obviously real, who witness an artificial intelligence that behaves like a human.  As well as the majority of V-tuber – yes, that’s what they call them in America – Neuro-sama appears as a Japanese anime-style character.
- 
- “Machine men, with machines instead of brains and hearts.  You are not machines, you are not beasts, you are men”
- Charlie Chaplin in the famous speech of The Great Dictator
- V-tubers have been a steadily growing phenomenon in recent years.  Just think of the success of Kizuna AIa Japanese virtual YouTuber who sings and messages her friends over 3 million subscribers.  However, Neuro-sama seems to have more advanced features, managing to interact in an absolutely credible way with the chat.
- Not only that, like many real users on Twitch, Neuro-sama often streams video games like Minecraft and osu!, a rhythm game that is especially popular in Japan.  In this game you even beat the world champion, although you are not allowed, for obvious reasons, to compete in dedicated export tournaments.  A story that is very reminiscent of the famous chess match between the supercomputer Deep Blue and the champion Garry Kasparov.  But those were different times.
- 
- Like many modern AI-based chatbots, Neuro-sama uses predictive models of speech, drawing on a huge database of expressions, all taken freely from the web.  A complex system which, however, is far from perfect.  Since the internet is definitely not the healthiest place in the world, many of the expressions that end up in the AI ​​database are in fact full of racist and sexist stereotypes.  Phrases and expressions that Twitch obviously does not tolerate on its platform.
- To function properly, therefore, Neuro-sama has its back a moderation team both incoming and outgoing (which therefore also moderates the AI ​​itself).  “There are obviously a lot of filters in place to prevent her responses from being inappropriate or offensive,” explained its creator Vedal, who brought Neuro-sama to life in 2018.

- Trending streaming, TV, Movies and pop culture news, features and more
- Artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere on the internet nowadays, acting as art generators, chatbots, and other forms of communication. Neuro-sama is an example of that, with the AI VTuber conquering Twitch and osu! at the same time. But what does it say about the future of gaming, streaming, and its relationship with AI?
- On December 19, Neuro-sama was rebooted. The AI project, created by ‘Vedal987’ originally back in 2019, set out on the task of mastering the rhythm game osu!.
- Back then, it was just a standalone program with no personality beyond the name. There wasn’t a character, and while it was streamed on Twitch to the interest of the devoted fandom of the circle-clicking title, it hung out in its own niche.
- Fast forward four years, with AI now playing a more prevalent role in the online space, Neuro-sama is turning heads.
- She’s more than a socially-unaware program. Neuro-sama has a personality and a VTuber model, all crafted by Vedal and adapted through AI. Using one of the default VTube Studio rigs, Neuro now sits there all day on Twitch, playing through osu beatmaps and even interacting with chat about the hottest topics of the day.
- Clips of her talking about xQc, clapping back at Vedal, and more have already gone viral. She’s sentient in a way ⁠— one clip of her talking about her needing to shower had many laughing. How does an AI take a shower?
- In just 10 days though, Neuro-sama has become the talk of the town in both osu! and VTubing circles for different reasons. She has already beaten the current top osu! player in the world, Australian teenager ‘mrekk’, in a tournament-style 1v1. As for her Twitch viewership, she’s averaged nearly 2,000 viewers since the reboot, including peaks above 4,000.
- incoming transmission from neuro-sama @mrekkosu pic.twitter.com/Wfv4NxykJ3
- Vedal is a self-described “student with a particular interest in AI”. Talking to Dexerto, they said the idea of reviving the Neuro-sama project as an AI VTuber came after talking to a friend about using chat models for streamers.
- “One of my friends had the idea to make an AI Streamer using a large language model, and I thought it totally had potential,” they said.
- Large language models (LLMs) are “pretrained on a large amount of text from the internet so they have a lot of knowledge,” Vedal explained. This large database allows for better understanding of human communication ⁠— it can comb through trillions of responses to see how to answer specific questions, or interact in a specific manner.
- Vedal labeled Neuro-sama as one fun experiment. However in VTubing, the mere mention of AI brings plenty of baggage.
- Unlike the AI art programs infiltrating the space, which artists say is exploitative of their work, Vedal’s design doesn’t really break that line. He spent a lot of time fine tuning Neuro’s personality before sending her live on Twitch. The model he uses is fair use from VTube Studio. It’s all his work, or copyright-free.
- “I later had the idea to combine it with my osu! AI that I was already working on improving, and I revived it this year in particular because that’s when I finally finished making it,” he continued.
- Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.
- “The VTuber aspect was an obvious choice to combine with AI because it’s much easier to control an avatar than try to generate a video of a real person.”
- AI has already triumphed in other games. AlphaStar, a program designed to beat the world’s best Starcraft 2 players, took down some of the greats of the game back in 2018. It used a “deep neural network” to get input data from what’s on screen to then output a command in game, learning game theory and strategies by playing random players on the ladder.
- Early reviews noted that while AlphaStar had lower APM than some of the top players, it was more accurate and also didn’t make as many unnecessary inputs.
- The same was achieved in Dota 2 with OpenAI Five. It took some months for it to consistently beat professional teams, but after two years the AI managed to beat two-time The International champions OG in April 2019.
- Neuro-sama conquered osu! much quicker: “It took Neuro-sama 10 days to become arguably better than the best human player at osu! since she beat mrekk in the 1v1,” Vedal said. “AI totally has the power to be better than humans, even in really complex games.”
- All this poses the question: where does this lead for gaming’s, and VTubing’s, relationship with artificial intelligence? Will it continue to be a “fun experiment”, or will our future entertainers all spawn from programs rather than a human behind the screen?
- That’s as much a question of the technology as it is of what the audience wants.
- “I think there might be a market for AI streamers since they have some qualities streamers can’t have ⁠— they could stream 24/7, can be better than humans at games, could theoretically read every chat message,” they said.
- “I have no idea if AI streamers have a place in the future of streaming or if streamers should be worried about their jobs. I assume most of the attention at the moment is because of the novelty of it, but we’ll see.”
- And as for Neuro-sama, the project isn’t ending here, with Vedal planning on expanding her reach even further: “I intend to expand outside of osu! and have her play more games, as well as improving her intelligence (memory) and understanding of Twitch chat.”

- Trending streaming, TV, Movies and pop culture news, features and more
- AI-Trained VTuber Neuro-sama has been banned from Twitch, following comments made during some on-stream slip-ups from the AI’s speech.
- Over the last few weeks, AI-powered VTuber Neuro-Sama has gained traction across the community. First created back in 2018 by game developer Vedal, the program has gained a personality and regularly holds conversations with its audience.
- However, on December 28, 2022, things went sour after the AI made comments doubting that the Holocaust was real among other controversial remarks.
- Just weeks later, the account has been banned from Twitch.
- At the time of writing, it’s unknown the exact reason why the VTuber’s account was banned from the platform as Vedal has yet to address it publicly.
- Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.
- However, when you visit Vedal’s channel (the channel that hosted the AI VTuber) you’re met with a message stating it’s temporarily unavailable.
- According to Twitch tracker, the account had amassed nearly 100,000 followers with an average viewership of 3,489, gaining nearly 40k of those followers in the past 30 days.
- Twitch doesn’t publicly comment about bans from the platform, so we’ll have to wait to see if Vedal reveals details of the punishment.
- We’ll update this article as more information becomes available.

- I said in my original post that I planned to let it turn off relax and start clicking and that is already happening, if you follow my twitch ( https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987) you will have seen some of the test streams where I started trying this.

- I look forward to seeing you all there, neuro-sama #1 soon™.
