- USA Today reports that a robot burger-flipper at Caliburger, Pasadena, has been put on extended leave after working only a single shift due to a surge of orders after its introduction.
- Having made a big noise about its Flippy robot that it described as 'the future of food', manufacturer Miso Robotics had to pull its technology after it quickly exceeded its 2,000-burger-a-day capacity.
- According to CaliBurger CTO Anthony Lomelino, 'human staff' were part of the problem. 'Working with people, you talk to each other. With Flippy, you kind of need to work around his schedule' he says.
- The incident stimulated discussion about the purpose of robots and their impact on jobs, with some commentators reckoning many jobs will disappear, and income equalities widen.
- In an October 2022 interview with Reuters, Miso Robotics CEO Mike Bell said that some day, people will 'walk into a restaurant and look at a robot and say, 'Hey, remember the old days when humans used to do that kind of thing?’ 'And those days ... it's coming. ... It's just a matter of ... how quick.'
- Flippy's replacement robot Flippy 2 is marketed as 'flexible and modular to meet any kitchen's needs'.
- Flippy 2 costs a minimum USD 3,000 a month.

- PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Miso 
      Robotics, the leading robotics and artificial intelligence solutions 
      company, today announced the public debut of ‘Flippy,’ the world’s first 
      autonomous robotic kitchen assistant. Flippy will begin working 
      alongside kitchen staff at CaliBurger’s Pasadena, California location 
      during lunchtime by flipping burger patties and removing them from the 
      grill when cooked to order.
- 
- Aiming to augment commercial kitchen operations with advanced 
      technology, Miso Robotics developed Miso AI, a cloud-connected learning 
      platform that powers industrial robotic arms. Miso AI combines 3D, 
      thermal and regular vision to automatically detect when raw burger 
      patties are placed on the grill and monitors each one in real-time 
      throughout the cooking process. As the patties cook, Miso AI displays 
      the cooking time on a screen that also alerts kitchen staff when to 
      place cheese on top or when to dress a burger. It also enables Flippy to 
      switch from using a spatula for raw meat and one for cooked meat. In 
      addition, Flippy has the ability to clean spatulas while cooking and to 
      wipe the surface of the grill with a scraper.
- “I couldn’t be more proud of my incredibly talented team for their hard 
      work in bringing Flippy to life and we are just getting started,” said 
      David Zito, co-founder and chief executive officer of Miso Robotics. 
      “Our mission is to improve working conditions of chefs and line cooks 
      with assistants, not replace them. Anyone who’s ever worked in a 
      restaurant knows how hard the work is and the value of extra hands and 
      that’s exactly what we built.”
- Miso Robotics understands the many challenges restaurants face, 
      including turnover rate and increasing demand for prepared foods. In 
      2016, the team partnered with CaliBurger, Cali Group’s restaurant 
      operating division, to develop a cost-effective and highly efficient 
      solution leveraging their expertise in robotics and artificial 
      intelligence. This resulted in the concept for Flippy, which was 
      specifically designed to operate in an existing commercial kitchen 
      layout and to serve alongside kitchen staff to safely and efficiently 
      fulfill a variety of cooking tasks.
- John Miller, chairman of Cali Group, added, “The deployment of Flippy in 
      CaliBurger restaurants represents a major milestone in helping our staff 
      produce mouthwatering burgers more consistently and in a timely manner. 
      The ease of integration into our existing kitchen lines will also allow 
      us to quickly install Flippy in more locations nationwide.”
- “I can’t think of anything more rewarding than working on something so 
      challenging that also has the potential to be impactful,” said Dr. Ryan 
      Sinnet, co-founder and chief technology officer of Miso Robotics. “Our 
      team poured their hearts into getting Flippy ready to cook for people 
      and I’m so proud of the grit we displayed to accomplish this in record 
      time.”

- PASADENA, Calif., March 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Miso Robotics and Cali Group today unveiled Flippy, an artificial intelligence-driven robot that will work alongside kitchen staff to grill burgers at CaliBurger restaurants. Flippy had its debut at the CaliBurger location in Pasadena, California. A video demonstration captured the robotic kitchen assistant flipping burgers and placing them on buns. Flippy will roll out in early 2018 and expand to more than 50 CaliBurger restaurants worldwide by the end of 2019.
- Miso Robotics is pioneering the use of computer vision and deep learning software to bring low-cost, adaptable robotics into restaurants. The company's collaborative kitchen assistant handles the hazardous, tedious and time-sensitive aspects of grilling and cooks burgers to perfection every time. It easily integrates into CaliBurger's current kitchen layout without needing to reconfigure existing equipment.

- 
- PASADENA — The Caliburger chain can’t keep burger flippers employed. They quit too often, it says.
- So the plan is to try something new: a robot that has been programmed to flip hamburgers all day long. Named Flippy, the $100,000 machine is capable of flipping as many as 2,000 burgers a day.
- As of Monday, a human at Caliburger's restaurant here is making the burger patties, seasoning them and placing them in a tray for the robot. Flippy pulls them out, places them on the griddle, monitors their temperature, flips them and takes them off the griddle to cool. They then get placed by a human into buns for customers.
- “People see a robot, they hear robot, they assume job replacement,” says David Zito, CEO of Miso Robotics, which created Flippy with the Cali Group, the owner of the Pasadena-based Caliburger chain. “This isn’t about replacing jobs. This is about a third hand in the kitchen.”
- Whether it's burgers, cars or farming, robots are becoming capable of doing jobs that were once staples of employment. In late 2017, a study by the Pew Research Center showed three-quarters of Americans said it is at least "somewhat realistic" that robots and computers eventually will perform most of the jobs now done by people, and the survey found respondents worried about the fallout, such as income inequality.
- Tests by restaurants using robots have been mostly viewed as a public relations stunt. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the Zume Pizza chain uses a pizza-making robot to cook the pies while Sally the robot, also in the San Francisco area, makes your salad.
- If the robots do take off, they raise the prospect of sapping — or at least shaking up — one of the high-growth areas of U.S. employment.  From 2007 to 2017, restaurant jobs that focus on fast food rose 40%  to 4.9 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's faster than health care, construction or manufacturing.
- Fast-food workers have been pushing for higher wages — and some big chains, facing high turnover and voter mandates, have complied.
- More: Minimum-wage increases: 18 states, 20 cities lift pay floors
- But not all. Many workers are still fighting to get $15 an hour.
- "People who work in fast food aren’t scared of robots. What’s really scary is getting paid so little we need food stamps and public assistance to take care of our families," says Rosalyn King, a McDonald’s worker from Detroit who is active in the union-backed Fight for $15 movement.
- For the Caliburger chain, which advertises $3.99 "Southern California style" hamburgers, keeping employees in the kitchen is difficult.
- “We train them, they work on the grill, they realize it’s not fun ... and so they leave and drive Ubers,” says John Miller, CEO of the Cali Group.
- More: Erica, the humanoid robot, is chatty but still has a lot to learn
- Miller hopes the robot can turn that around. From Pasadena, he’s looking to bring Flippy to his restaurants in Seattle, Washington, D.C., Baltimore and Annapolis, Md., this year. He has 50 stores in his chain and says he will eventually get the robot to all of them.
- More than half of all tasks associated with fast-food restaurants are poised to be automated, says McKinsey Global Institute, a private-sector think tank.
- At a test run recently of Flippy for the news media, the robot flipped with ease. But when it took the burgers off the griddle to cool on the tray, several didn’t make it all the way and fell off the tray. Zito says those were learning pains that would be fixed.
- The robots gets direction from thermal imaging and camera vision on when to flip the burger and remove it.
- Flippy will most certainly take jobs away, says Julie Carpenter, a research fellow with the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, Calif. But she doesn't see fast food going 100% robotic. Restaurants will still need cashiers, people to open and close up, and workers for other tasks.
- As for reception from the public, she says, "people might think it's cool, or angry that machines are taking over."
- Christian Warren, who owns the Melody Bar & Grill in Westchester, Calif., is skeptical his clientele would go for a robot burger flipper. "Many of my customers have specific needs. ... They want a burger well-done or medium," he says.
- For now, Flippy can make burgers only one way, but that will be adapted in the future to cook menu items to order, its maker says.
- Another question is the price tag. The robot costs $60,000 to $100,000 for the Flippy that also cleans the oven. Warren says it would take him "years" to recoup the $100,000. "Eventually you'll save on labor, but it will take a long time to get there."
- Meanwhile, how does a robot burger taste? This reporter tried one of the cheeseburgers, and it tasted just like a human-made one. It was well-cooked, and it's doubtful  anyone would be able to tell the difference.
- The only beef: The burger was a little salty, but you can't exactly complain to the chef, now can you?

- 
- PASADENA, Calif. — Flippy, the burger-flipping robot that threatens to supplant short-order cooks, has taken its first extended break.
- But the burger maker isn't blaming balky robotics for the snafu. Rather, it says humans -- or in this case, not enough of them -- are at fault.
- 
- After word got out about a human-replacing robot that could grill as many as 2,000 burgers a day, the Cali Group, which operates the Cali Burger chain says it was swamped with more interest, both from curious diners and potential robot buyers, than it could handle.
- When news coverage about Flippy went viral, the Cali Group said it realized it needed to spend more time on training humans to keep up.
- While Flippy held up its end of the deal, the restaurant is short of humans to prepare the patties for the grill and then pile on the lettuce and other fixins', said Anthony Lomelino, chief technology officer for Cali Group. For now, there's no robot for those tasks.
- The robotic arms of "Flippy's Kitchen" is still on static display at Caliburger. The stage where patrons would normally line up for a peek was dark when USA TODAY visited Thursday, and there was little sign that Flippy would be coming back, but just when was "TBA" -- or to be announced. The restaurant was operating without the robot using its regular, human-run kitchen.
- 
- Flippy may be temporarily down, but he's far from out.
- So far, tests by restaurants using robots have been mostly viewed as public-relations stunts. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the Zume Pizza chain uses a pizza-making robot to cook the pies while Sally the robot, also in the San Francisco area, makes your salad.
- But whether it's burgers, cars or farming, robots are gradually becoming capable of doing jobs that employ millions of workers. In late 2017, a study by the Pew Research Center showed three-quarters of Americans said it is at least "somewhat realistic" that robots and computers eventually will perform most of the jobs now done by people. The survey found respondents worried about the fallout, such as income inequality that would result from mass unemployment.
- In the decade leading up to last year, restaurant jobs that focused on fast food rose 40%  to 4.9 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's faster than health care, construction or manufacturing.
- Fast-food workers have been pushing for higher wages. Some big chains, facing high turnover and voter mandates, have complied.
- But not all. Many workers are still fighting to earn $15 an hour. Caliburger pays employees from $13 to $14 an hour, depending upon the location.
- "People who work in fast food aren’t scared of robots. What’s really scary is getting paid so little we need food stamps and public assistance to take care of our families," says Rosalyn King, a McDonald’s worker from Detroit who is active in the union-backed Fight for $15 movement.
- For Caliburger, which advertises $3.99 "Southern California-style" hamburgers, keeping employees in the kitchen is difficult, the company says.
- “We train them, they work on the grill, they realize it’s not fun ... and so they leave and drive Ubers,” says John Miller, CEO of the Cali Group.
- Caliburger hopes to have 50 restaurants open by the end of the year. After Pasadena, it hopes to have a Flippy at its locations in Seattle; Washington, D.C.; and Annapolis, Md.
- Once Caliburger works the kinks out, Flippy robots will certainly take jobs away, says Julie Carpenter, a research fellow with the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, Calif. But she doesn't see fast food going 100% robotic. Restaurants will still need cashiers, people to open and close up, and workers for other tasks.
- As for reception from the public, she says, "people might think it's cool, or angry that machines are taking over."
- 
- Cali's Lomelino was enlisted to get Flippy up and running, and is now training the store manager about the ins and outs of working with robots. Specifically, that means putting burger patties together, seasoning them, and prepping them for the robot to grab, grill, flip and making them ready for customers.
- "Mostly it's the timing," he said. "When you're in the back, working with people, you talk to each other. With Flippy, you kind of need to work around his schedule. Choreographing the movements of what you do, when and how you do it."
- The moral to the story: technology is cool and can do many wonderful things, but advancements like robots that can cook a hamburger won't happen overnight, Lomelino said.
- His advice to other restaurants looking to enter the robotic revolution: "Be ready  for a whole lot of inbound calls."

- PASADENA, Calif. — Flippy is back.
- After a rocky debut in March that lasted only one day, Flippy, the hamburger-flipping robot, is back in action at the Caliburger restaurant here in the heart of this Los Angeles suburb.
- "Now he moves like a ninja and is more reliable," says David Zito, the CEO of Miso Robotics, which created Flippy.
- Miso had convinced Caliburger that a $100,000 robot could take the place of short-order cooks, who often quit after just working a few weeks because it's so hot in the kitchen.
- With automated flipping of burgers, there was no break time, and customers could get their orders consistently, working side by side with humans who prepared the patties and assembled them after cooking into buns.
- That was the pitch, and when Flippy landed, people were fascinated, with headlines about the burger-flipping robot making the national network TV news from here to as far as England.
- Interest in the robot was so great, Flippy couldn't handle the demand, nor could it consistently put the burgers properly into the trays for the co-workers.
- "We got a little ahead of ourselves," says Zito, and "were overwhelmed by the response."
- Training was an issue. Caliburger and Miso hadn't taught enough staffers how to work with Flippy. Additionally, Flippy was having trouble with how it placed the finished burgers on the tray; it would miss the target. "Now he sees better," says Zito.
- Flippy began operating quietly at the beginning of May and has served every lunch since, seven days a week, for three hours a day.
- When USA TODAY visited the other day, the lines were shorter than they were back after Flippy's initial launch, but the interest level was still high. Flippy was an attraction that brought customers into the store: Patrons lined up to take photos of the robot, who has its own "Flippy's Kitchen" stage where people get to watch the bot in action.
- "We've been trained since childhood that robotics were coming in the future," notes Louise Perrin, an accountant who works nearby. "To be a part of it, to see it and watch it happen live in front of you ... is absolutely incredible."
- If the robots such as Flippy become more widespread, they risk cutting into one of the fastest-growing job sectors. From 2007 to 2017, restaurant jobs that focus on fast food rose 40% to 4.9 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or more rapid than health care, construction or manufacturing.
- Sharon Pinson lived in Pasadena for many years and was preparing to move to Florida. But before the moving vans pulled away, "I had to come in and see Flippy," she says. "I'd heard the buzz. The concept of a robot flipping your burger is awesome."
- Her verdict? Thumbs up on the burger and the performance. "It's way better than any other person, he cleans the grill, cleans the spatula, and it's fun."
- Note to foodies on National Burger Day: The robot made burgers at Caliburger can't be personalized. They are cooked to order, with specifications as added cheese and onions. But if, for instance, you want a patty cooked medium or rare or less salty, you'll need to shop elsewhere.
- Zito notes that no one at Flippy Caliburgerlost their job to make room for Flippy. The robot can't work without humans, he adds. Caliburger is still on track to launch 50 more Flippy robots at its chain by 2019, he says.

- Good news if you’re worried about a robot taking your job: it turns out even mechanical laborers need a break.
- Only a single shift into its career at the CaliBurger restaurant in Pasadena, California, this week, Flippy the robot burger-flipper is going on hiatus, reports USA Today. The bot, created by startup Miso Robotics, made its debut earlier this week assisting in CaliBurger’s kitchen by flipping patties on the grill. According to reports, the robot did its job well but was such a hit with customers that Miso Robotics is giving Flippy time off over the weekend for some upgrades.
- According to Miso spokeswoman Stephanie Cirigliano, the company needs to perform tests on the robot “to make sure the location can fulfill a large number of orders.” Cirigliano told USA Today that it will put Flippy back on burger duty next week, but it’ll only be for a limited time each day (between 11AM and 2PM to help cover the lunchtime shift).
- Flippy is more of an automaton than a human replacement. It’s essentially an industrial robot arm with a spatula attached that uses machine vision to locate burgers on the grill, time how long they’ve been cooking, and flip them when needed. Human workers still have to do everything else — including placing cheese on the burger, assembling the food, and taking a customer’s order. Flippy is primarily earning its keep as a visitor attraction, just like those Chinese restaurants that use robot waiters.
- Despite these gimmicks, it seems robots are slowly finding their place in new occupations. CaliBurger plans to install Flippy in 50 locations around the US, and Miso Robotics is only one of a number of startups using the latest tech to automate the food industry. Startup Momentum Machines has raised $18 million to take its burger robot into fast-food joints, and other companies are building machines that make pizzas and salads.
- The fact that even a basic bot like Flippy needs a lot of tinkering to adapt to life in the kitchen shows that integrating robots into human jobs is tougher than it looks. But, it’s still happening — one burger at a time.

- 
- The burger-flipping robotic fry cook has been temporarily "retired." Why? Because the robot's human colleagues couldn't keep up with it.
- Built by Miso Robotics, Flippy, described on the company's website as "the world's first autonomous robotic kitchen assistant," was touted as a high-tech helper for fast-food restaurant kitchens in a statement announcing its unveiling in 2017. Equipped with a spatula-tipped arm, Flippy was built to operate alongside human workers and to increase efficiency in cooking and grill maintenance.
- But poor Flippy faced unexpected challenges in meeting the demands of hungry restaurant patrons, and was relieved of his responsibilities after only two days on the job. [The 6 Strangest Robots Ever Created]
- But it wasn't Flippy's fault. Rather, the robot's human co-workers weren't able to assemble the burgers as quickly as Flippy could grill the patties, USA Today reported.
- Flippy joined the staff working the grill at a CaliBurger restaurant in Pasadena, California, on March 5, where he was tasked with flipping burgers and scooping them off the grill once they were fully cooked, Miso Robotics representatives announced in a statement released that day.
- The robotic fry cook combined a jointed arm — capable of wielding a spatula or a grill scraper — with cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) and thermal vision that enabled it to tell whether a burger was raw or well-done. To ensure that all burgers were thoroughly cooked, Flippy would monitor each patty in real time, using a display screen readout to inform its human co-workers when a burger is ready for dressings and a bun.
- In a video shared by Miso Robotics, Flippy's view of a grill included a thermal readout displayed in the upper-right corner, indicating which patties were ready to be flipped or served.
- FLIPPY | POV from Miso Robotics on Vimeo.
- Flippy wasn't intended to replace people but rather to serve as "extra hands" at the grill, Miso Robotics representatives said in the statement.
- CaliBurger prepared for Flippy's debut with a special cooking area designated as the robot's kitchen domain, including a sign that read "Flippy's Corner." But Flippy's introduction did not go as smoothly as planned, as there were not enough people working behind the counter to dress the finished burgers at the pace Flippy could make them, a CaliBurger representative told USA Today.
- Miso Robotics announced in 2017 that autonomous burger-makers like Flippy would be installed in more than 50 CaliBurger locations around the world by the end of 2019. But for now, the one location willing to take a chance on a robot fry cook has temporarily turned off its spotlight. The Pasadena CaliBurger's website still urges customers to "Come see Flippy in action," though Flippy's schedule has been amended to read "to be announced."

- The robot takeover may have hit a snag: The machine that was said to be one of the most formidable opponents of the human workforce has turned out to be somewhat underqualified for the job. Flippy, the name of the robot that chain CaliBurger purchased to flip burgers at its locations, has gone on an “extended break” after working one regular shift behind the grill.
- It made its big debut earlier this week as one of the 50 Flippys that the chain plans to install nationwide in coming months. CaliBurger and the machine’s maker Miso Robotics both insist this is “the future of food,” and they’re quick to explain Flippy is actually a boon to food-service workers — it’s there to aid, not replace, them. The large automated arm purportedly uses cameras and thermal scanners to “work with” and “learn from” its human co-workers, so that “together” the team can make faster, more perfect food.

- In reality, things worked out a little differently: USA Today reports that after word got out about Flippy, the public descended upon Pasadena’s CaliBurger. Soon, the poor bot was operating well beyond its 2,000-burger-a-day capacity, and the chain decided to pull its plug (figuratively, but also probably literally?) and run some upgrades.

- Alas, human staff were apparently part of the problem, too. CaliBurger’s chief technology officer, Anthony Lomelino, says the issue was mostly timing: “Working with people, you talk to each other. With Flippy, you kind of need to work around his schedule.” While Flippy catches some R & R, CaliBurger will retrain cooks to be better team players. In the meantime, the device is just powered down at its station, which now has a sign that says Flippy will be grilling patties again “soon.”

- PASADENA, Calif., Oct 4 (Reuters) - Fast-food French fries and onion rings are going high-tech, thanks to a company in Southern California.
- Miso Robotics Inc in Pasadena has started rolling out its Flippy 2 robot, which automates the process of deep frying potatoes, onions and other foods.
- A big robotic arm like those in auto plants - directed by cameras and artificial intelligence - takes frozen French fries and other foods out of a freezer, dips them into hot oil, then deposits the ready-to-serve product into a tray.
- Flippy 2 can cook several meals with different recipes simultaneously, reducing the need for catering staff and, says Miso, speed up order delivery at drive-through windows.
- “When an order comes in through the restaurant system, it automatically spits out the instructions to Flippy," Miso Chief Executive Mike Bell said in an interview.
- " ... It does it faster or more accurately, more reliably and happier than most humans do it,” Bell added.
- Miso said it took five years to develop Flippy and recently made it commercially available.
- The robot's name comes from Flippy, an earlier robot designed to flip burgers. But once Miso's team finished that machine, they realized there was a much tighter bottleneck at the fry station, particularly late at night.

- Bell said Flippy 2 makes a splash - at first.
- “When we put a robot into a location, the customers that come up and order, they all take pictures, they take videos, they ask a bunch of questions. And then the second time they come in, they seem not to even notice it, just take it for granted," he said.
- Miso engineers can watch Flippy 2 robots working in real time on a big screen, enabling them to help troubleshoot any problems that crop up. A number of restaurant chains have adopted the robotic fry cook, including Jack in the Box in San Diego, White Castle in the Midwest and CaliBurger on the West Coast, Bell said.
- Bell said three other big U.S. fast-food chains have put Flippy 2 to work, but says they're hesitant to advertise because of sensitivities about perceptions that robots are taking jobs away from humans.
- “The task that the humans are most happy to offload are tasks like the fry station. ... They're delighted to have the help so they can do other things," Bell said.
- Miso Robotics has around 90 engineers, who tinker with prototypes or work on computer code. One of its next projects is Sippy, a drink-making robot which will take an order from a customer, pour drinks, put lids on them, insert a straw and group them together.
- Bell said that some day, people will "walk into a restaurant and look at a robot and say, 'Hey, remember the old days when humans used to do that kind of thing?’
- "And those days ... it's coming. ... It's just a matter of ... how quick.”

- If any workforce is under the looming threat of being replaced by automation, it’s the fast food industry.
- One of such mechanized threats takes the form of Flippy, a hamburger flipping robot developed by Miso Robotics. Operated by an AI and cameras, the wage slave Terminator is  now back with its next evolution, Flippy 2. Where the original Flippy was limited to burgers, Flippy 2 is now a fry cook killer, deep frying delicious crispy stuff from french fries to onion rings mostly on its own.
- And in a new interview, the company's CEO — intentionally or not — sounded strikingly contemptuous of the human workers the bot will be replacing.
- "It does it faster or more accurately, more reliably and happier than most humans do it," Miso CEO Mike Bell told Reuters in a new interview.
- You heard the man. This docile robot will get the job done — without ever complaining about grueling hours or stagnant wages.
- Ostensibly, the robot helper is supposed to work alongside overburdened human employees rather than replacing them. According to Miso, human workers are "happy to offload" working at the fry station to the robot.
- Of course, that line of reasoning glosses over why those workers are overburdened in the first place, and doesn’t provide a satisfactory answer on what a robot like Flippy solves that adding another human employee doesn’t.
- In addition, Flippy 2 is capable of autonomously grabbing frozen ingredients out of the freezer, as well as cooking multiple meals containing different recipes at the same time. In other words, it sounds a lot like the end goal is a fast food outlet with as few human workers as possible.
- All those thorny ethical questions haven't stopped chains like Jack in the Box, White Castle, and Caliburger from already putting Flippy 2 to use, which we guess we can't be too surprised about.
- Bell envisions that someday, customers will "walk into a restaurant and look at a robot and say, 'Hey, remember the old days when humans used to do that kind of thing?’
- "And those days," he added, "it's coming... It's just a matter of ... how quick."
