- French civil rights group SOS Racisme, alongside a raft of other French equality orgainsations, has accused Google of wrongfuly labeling Rupert Murdoch, Jon Hamm and other celebrities as 'Jewish'.
- The complaint alleges that Google's Autocomplete function 'systematically' equates Murdoch and others with being Jewish, thereby stereotyping and discriminating against Jews, advancing racist ideas about Jewish conspiracies, and violating a French law against compiling files on people that refer to their ethnicity.
- The case was dropped in June 2012 after both sides reached an agreement. It was unclear whether Google was forced to make any changes to Autocomplete.

- French organization says Google search engine's auto-complete is anti-Semitic.

- Google has been hit with a lawsuit in France for suggesting that certain celebrities, including News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch and Mad Men star Jon Hamm, are “Jewish.”

- 
- Since 2008, Google has been attempting to anticipate what its users will type into search boxes with its “Suggest” feature, but lawyers for SOS Racisme, a French organization that fights discrimination, say that by connecting persons with an often persecuted religious minority, the web giant is overseeing “the creation of what is probably the biggest Jewish file in history.”
- 
- According to local press reports, there’s a hearing scheduled for Wednesday in the lawsuit. The plaintiff is contending that Google’s users are confronted daily with unsolicited and systematic associations between famous people and their Jewishness.
- This isn’t the first time that Google has gotten in trouble in France for the way it auto-completes what users type into search boxes.
- In 2009, Google was hit with two verdicts in cases that questioned whether companies were defamed when it was “suggested” these companies were associated with the French word for “scam.”
- One of those companies emerged victorious when a judge declared that no algorithm could justify the prejudice caused by Google. The other company got a judge to declare that Google could be found liable because the company had informed Google of the situation, meaning Google had no safe harbor from liability. The judges, though, were split on whether to order changes. The judge in the latter case cited free speech.

- Google has a page that explains its policies on its autocomplete feature. The company notes some instances where no predicted searches appear for a particular word or topic. One such instance is when “The search term violates our autocomplete policies.” Google says it excludes “a narrow class of search queries related to pornography, violence, hate speech and copyright infringement.”
- The Jewish association isn’t merely reserved to France, by the way. According to our review, on the U.S. site, Rupert Murdoch is suggested with “Twitter,” “scandal” and, yes, “Jewish.”

- Google made a change to its autocomplete feature so that it no longer suggests the phrase “are Jews evil” when a user starts a search with the words “are Jews,” The Guardian reports.
- The tech giant also removed the suggested phrase “are women evil” from searches beginning with “are women.”
- “We took action within hours of being notified on Friday of the autocomplete results,” Google said, The Guardian reported.
- No change was made, however, for searches starting with “are Muslims.” The phrase continued to return the word “bad,” despite a lengthy article in the Guardian over the weekend that explored the influence of right wing sites on search results, including the three autocomplete suggestions mentioned.
- Google didn’t say why only some changes were made to the tool, which offers users suggested phrases when typing words into Chrome’s search bar or Google’s search box.
- “Our search results are a reflection of the content across the web,” a Google spokesperson said, according to The Guardian. “This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don’t reflect Google’s own opinions or beliefs - as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.”
- The company said autocomplete predictions are generated algorithmically, based on the interests and search activity of users.
- “Because of this, terms that appear in autocomplete may be unexpected or unpleasant,” Google said, according to The Guardian. “We do our best to prevent offensive terms, like porn and hate speech, from appearing, but we acknowledge that autocomplete isn’t an exact science and we’re always working to improve our algorithms.”
- It also appeared on Monday that Google removed the suggested phrase “are women equal to men.” The phrase no longer turned up in suggested Google search results after being captured in a screenshot by the Guardian.

- Several French anti-discrimination organizations are suing Google for allegedly promulgating "unsolicited and systematic associations between famous people and their Jewishness" through Google's auto-complete function, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
- SOS Racisme has a hearing scheduled Wednesday for a lawsuit in which the association and a handful of other French anti-racism organizations allege the search giant is "overseeing the creation of what is probably the biggest Jewish file in history" with auto-complete search suggestions that associate famous figures, such as News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, with the words "Jew" and "Jewish."
- When users type Murdoch's name into Google.com, the suggested search results that drop down include "rupert murdoch jewish."
- "Numerous users of the first search engine of France and the world are confronted daily with the association, unsolicited and almost systematically, [of] the word 'Jew' with the names of those most prominent in the world of politics, media or business," SOS Racisme and other organizations state in their lawsuit, according to a translation of an article about the case published by the French-language La Côte newspaper.
- By merely suggesting the word "Jew" in auto-complete lists (like the one for Murdoch above), Google is allegedly violating a French constitutional law against compiling files on people that refer to their ethnicity, the suit claims.
- In its FAQ for auto-complete, Google explains that suggestions made by the feature "are a reflection of the search activity of all Web users and the contents of Web pages indexed by Google."
- Those results "may include silly or strange or surprising terms and phrases," the company notes, adding, "[w]hile we always strive to algorithmically reflect the diversity of content on the Web (some good, some objectionable), we also apply a narrow set of removal policies for pornography, violence, hate speech, and terms that are frequently used to find content that infringes copyrights."
- Google further states in the FAQ that "Queries in auto-complete are algorithmically determined based on a number of factors (including search term popularity) without manual intervention."
- Auto-complete results have become an Internet meme, with websites dedicated to compiling the most bizarre and hilarious results.

- Google’s autocomplete feature, which has faced many legal challenges over the past several years, is facing a new lawsuit in a French court related to Rupert Murdoch search query suggestions. When a Google user types “Rupert Murdoch,” the search engine suggests they complete a search for “Rupert Murdoch Jewish.”  The lawsuit, which was filed by SOS Racisme, accuses Google of mislabeling celebrities, connecting people to an often persecuted religion, and creating the “biggest Jewish file in history.”
- On the webpage describing the autcomplete algorithm, Google states that the algorithm determines the autcomplete content without human intervention:
- “Just like the web, the search queries presented may include silly or strange or surprising terms and phrases. While we always strive to algorithmically reflect the diversity of content on the web (some good, some objectionable), we also apply a narrow set of removal policies for pornography, violence, hate speech, and terms that are frequently used to find content that infringes copyrights.”
- In addition to the Rupert Murdoch queries, Google’s autocomplete feature has faced several other legal battles. For an unfortunate Japanese man, the autocomplete algorithm displayed search results related to crimes he did not commit. Although he ultimately won the cyber-defamation case in a Japanese court, the feature tarnished his reputation and cost him several job opportunities. In addition, Google was fined $65,000 last December by a French court for an autocomplete suggestion that hurt the reputation of an insurance company by adding the French word for “crook” to the end of the company’s name.
- Since Google is able to filter certain terms related to pornography, racism, and violence, it is obvious that Google has the technology to easily apply filters to certain types of queries. Is it time for Google to update its autocomplete algorithm to prevent reputation damage and ensure compliance with each country’s laws?
- The initial lawsuit hearing is scheduled to take place in a French court on Wednesday.

- A new lawsuit alleges that Google's search engine has an anti-Semitism problem.
- French anti-discrimination organization SOS Racisme, in association with the Union of Jewish Students of France, the Movement Against Racism and for Friendship Among Peoples and other organizations, is suing Google because its autocomplete feature suggests the word "Jewish" in searches involving certain public figures, including News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch and actor Jon Hamm, reports The Times of Israel.
- Indeed, querying the search engine for "Jon Hamm," for example, yields "Jon Hamm Jewish" as one of the top results.
- LOOK:
- According to Google's website, its algorithm for the Google Instant autocomplete feature "predicts and displays search queries based on other users' search activities and the contents of web pages indexed by Google." In addition, the search engine says it strives to "reflect the diversity of content on the web (some good, some objectionable)" and so has a narrow set of removal policies for pornography, violence, hate speech, etc. -- though not narrow enough for SOS Racisme, it seems.
- A lawyer for SOS Racisme, Patrick Kulgman, told Agence France Presse (AFP) that Google's autocomplete algorithms have resulted in "the creation of what is probably the biggest Jewish file in history,"  according to The Times of Israel. As an "ethnic file," this compilation is outlawed in the country.
- Local reports pointed out by The Hollywood Reporter explain that the plaintiffs contend users of Google in France and across the world are systematically confronted with the unsolicited association of the term "Jew" with prominent names in the world of politics, media, and business. A hearing for the lawsuit is scheduled for Wednesday.
- The Hollywood Reporter also writes that the last lawsuit Google saw in France due to its autocomplete feature occurred in 2009, when two French companies sued the search engine because its autocomplete feature suggested the French word for "scam" in searches for said companies' names.
- Just over a month ago, a man in Japan won an injunction against Google to have the autocomplete feature turned off when someone searched the man's name. Apparently, the search engine was connecting the man's name with crimes he had not committed and, according to Japan Times, "likely played a role in the sudden loss of his job several years ago and caused several companies to subsequently reject him when he applied for new jobs."

- Google may have honored Israel’s 64th birthday on its homepage last week, but in France, the company is being sued for suggesting the term “Jewish” in searches involving celebrities.
- SOS Racisme, a French organization that fights discrimination, is taking the Internet giant to court over a feature intended to speed up searches, but which often suggests the term “Jewish” when users type in the names of famous French people. (Google’s English sites use the same autocomplete tool, suggesting “Jewish” when you look up names including Rupert Murdoch and Jon Hamm. Neither is Jewish, but the suggestion, based on Google’s search algorithm, shows that many users are trying to find out if they are.)
- Patrick Kulgman, a lawyer for SOS Racisme, told Agence France Presse that the feature amounts to “the creation of what is probably the biggest Jewish file in history.” That would be a non-issue in many countries, but France has outlawed the compilation of “ethnic files,” AFP reports.
- SOS Racisme is joined in the lawsuit by France’s Union of Jewish Students and the Movement Against Racism and for Friendship Among Peoples, among other organizations.
- “Numerous users of the premier search engine in France and the world confront daily an unsolicited and almost systematic association between the term ‘Jewish’ and the last names of prominent figures in politics, media and business,” the suit says, creating a sense of Jewish “omnipotence in the French leadership.”
- Implemented by Google in 2008, the autocomplete tool is restricted in some instances. The site enforces a “narrow set of removal policies for pornography, violence, hate speech, and terms that are frequently used to find content that infringes copyrights,” the site says.

- Une audience a été fixée mercredi, a annoncé l'avocat de SOS Racisme, Me Patrick Klugman, qui estime que la fonctionnalité "Google Suggest" avait abouti à "la création de ce qui est probablement le plus grand fichier juif de l'histoire".

Disponible en France depuis 2008, "Google Suggest", ou la saisie semi-automatique permet de suggérer à l'internaute, quand il entre une requête dans la barre de recherche Google, d'autres demandes sur la foi notamment des requêtes faites par d'autres internautes.

Dans leur assignation, l'Union des étudiants juifs de France (UEJF), J'accuse!-action internationale pour la justice (AIPJ), SOS Racisme et le Mouvement contre le racisme et pour l'amitié entre les peuples (MRAP) s'insurgent contre le fait que le terme "juif" soit souvent proposé par Google Suggest lorsqu'une recherche est faite sur le nom d'une personnalité.

"De très nombreux utilisateurs du premier moteur de recherche de France et du monde sont quotidiennement confrontés à l'association non sollicitée et quasi systématique du terme 'juif' avec les patronymes des personnes les plus en vue dans le monde de la politique, des médias ou des affaires", déplorent ces organisations. Elles ont fait le test en entrant le nom des candidats à la présidentielle.

Pour les associations, en proposant le mot "juif" dans la saisie semi-automatique, Google Suggest enfreint la loi réprimant la constitution de fichiers ethniques. Sur son site, Google dit exclure de Google Suggest "une catégorie restreinte correspondant à des termes pornographiques, violents, incitant à la haine et liés à la violation de droits d'auteur".
