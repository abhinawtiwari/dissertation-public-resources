- Employee feedback and a swathe of negative media coverage has seen Barclays stop a trial of managers using software at its London HQ that monitored employee activity and performance.
- A whistleblower revealed to CityAm that the Sapience Analytics software monitored how long staff stayed at and how effective they are at their desks, told them to 'avoid breaks' and recorded toilet trips as 'unaccounted activity.
- Automated warnings were also fired at  employees judged to be away from their computers for too long, or if they had been spending too long on a particular task.
- The whistleblower alleged that the 'spyware' monitoring had resulted in additional stress, and had sparked a backlash. Barclays had responded that it had been using the software 'to tackle issues such as individual over-working as well as raise general productivity.'
- In March 2022, a UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) investigation concluded that the action warranted 'no further action', according (pdf) to a Freedom of Information request response.

- Barclays has been criticised by HR experts and privacy campaigners after the bank installed “Big Brother” employee monitoring software in its London headquarters.
- Introduced as a pilot last week, the technology monitors Barclays workers’ activity on their computers, and in some instances admonishes staff in daily updates to them if they are not deemed to have been active enough — which is described as being in “the zone”.
- The system tells staff to “avoid breaks” as it monitors their productivity in real-time, and records activities such as toilet visits as “unaccounted activity”.
- A whistleblower at the banking giant told City A.M. that “the stress this is causing is beyond belief” and that it “shows an utter disregard for employee wellbeing”.
- “Employees are worried to step away from their desks, have full lunch breaks, take bathroom breaks or even get up for water as we are not aware of the repercussions this might have on our statistics,” they added.
- Big Brother Watch, a privacy campaign group, described the technology as “creepy”.

- The software, provided by Sapience, has been rolled out throughout the product control department within the investment bank division at the firm’s Canary Wharf headquarters.
- Sapience describes the system as offering “automated work pattern reporting and real-time analytics” and “unprecedented visibility into how people work, with actionable insights to better manage cost and performance across teams.”
- The software compiles a report into an employees’ activity during the working day. A “work yoga” assessment sent to a Barclays employee earlier this week, seen by City A.M., warned the staffer of “not enough time in the Zone yesterday!”
- It added: “Tips: mute the phone, disable email/chat pop-ups, avoid breaks for 20+ minutes, 2–3 times a day.”
- The whistleblower described the rollout as turning the office into a “Big Brother state”.
- The controversial new software comes as the investment bank arm, of which the product control department is a part, reported increased profit at the end of 2019.
- The use of such software is becoming more widespread in the industry, but Ed Houghton, head of research at the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development, warned the technology could never be a “substitute for good line management”.
- “Employees shouldn’t feel they’re not trusted to use their time effectively or that they’re not trusted to be productive,” he added.
- Barclays’ product control function is tasked with compiling profit and loss accounts on the trading floor’s activities as well as communicating information with the rest of the bank and regulators.
- This is not the first time Barclays has been accused of invading the privacy of employees. In 2017 the firm was criticised for the use of OccupEye sensors which monitored how long employees were spending at their desks. A similar system was used at the Telegraph newspaper, but was removed after just a day following a backlash from employees.
- Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said: “Managers would never get away with breathing down employee’s necks, personally monitoring their screens or logging toilet and water breaks. The availability of technology to surveil staff surreptitiously does not make it any more acceptable.”
- “The use of this technology is creepy and should be urgently reviewed,” she added.
- A spokesperson for Barclays confirmed it had introduced the monitoring software, and said  “This type of technology is widely used across the industry to help identify what is working well and opportunities to improve processes.  Colleague wellbeing is of paramount importance and colleagues are free to take breaks whenever they choose.”
- They added the bank will listen carefully to any feedback resulting from the pilot.
- Sapience did not respond to requests for comment.

- Barclays says it has scrapped a system that tracked the time employees spent at their desks and sent warnings to those spending too long on breaks.
- The bank introduced the computer monitoring system last week, but faced a staff backlash, reported by City AM.
- Barclays said axing the tracking system was a response to "colleague feedback", but would not say if it was permanent.
- The software, Sapience, claims to create "unprecedented transparency" within companies.
- "It also determines when an employee goes offline for periods of time," the software firm's website says. A Barclays source said the tool was used to monitor the "effectiveness" of people's time at their desks.
- But in addition to sparking unease within the bank, it attracted criticism from privacy campaigners and HR professionals.
- Silkie Carlo, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said "intrusive monitoring" deprived staff of privacy in the workplace.
- "Managers would never get away with breathing down employee's necks, personally monitoring their screens or logging toilet and water breaks," she said. "The availability of technology to [monitor] staff surreptitiously does not make it any more acceptable."
- She described the software as "creepy" and called on Barclays to "urgently review" its use.
- Barclays said the software was part of a pilot that was rolled out in part of its investment banking division.
- But after the City AM newspaper revealed details of the scheme and published damning comments from an employee who spoke to the paper anonymously, Barclays said managers would no longer be able to track the activities of individual workers.
- In a statement, the bank said: "We always intended to listen to colleague feedback as part of this limited pilot which was intended to tackle issues such as individual over-working as well as raise general productivity."
- But Edward Houghton, head of research at Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, questioned whether it was ever appropriate to use what he described as a "Big Brother" approach to workplace monitoring.
- "Technologies like this may actually cause more harm than good," he said. "They can... create mistrust or low levels of trust for employees - employees can feel like they're being watched and not trusted to do their own work effectively."
- It is not the first time the bank has come under fire for using technology to monitor its staff.
- In 2017, Barclays faced widespread criticism after it installed black boxes under the bankers' desks to track how long they were spending at work.
- Campaign group Privacy International said: "Data protection rules are very clear, strict and do not allow employers to carry out such monitoring unless they are able to prove that this is strictly necessary and proportionate and it does not severely impact employees' rights.
- "People are entitled to some fundamental rights even if they are in work," it said. "International banks are no exception."

- Barclays last week switched on a program which allowed managers to see how long workers were at their desks
- Barclays is scrapping technology which allowed bosses to spy on its bankers following a backlash over the invasion of staff privacy.
- The bank is axing tracking software which allows managers to see how long employees are spending away from their desks and the time it takes to do different tasks at their computers.
- Introduced in a trial last week, the technology sends warnings to staff if they spend too long on a single task or are not active enough. It sparked fury from privacy campaigners, who said workers' rights were being violated.
- A spokesman for charity campaign group Privacy International said: “Data protection rules are very clear, strict and do not allow employers to carry out such monitoring unless they are able to prove that this is strictly necessary and proportionate and it does not severely impact employees' rights.
- “People are entitled to some fundamental rights even if they are in work. International banks are no exception.”It is understood that Barclays had been using the new system to collect information on employees anonymously, but turned on additional functions last week allowing managers to see individual employees’ activity patterns.
- The system is provided by external provider Sapience, a source close to the bank said. Its use was first reported by City AM on Wednesday, a day before Barclays said it would cease to allow managers to see staff’s data unless it was anonymised.
- Barclays has previously been accused of doing too little to rein in traders, allowing a toxic culture to grow up which helped trigger the Libor rate-rigging scandal that forced out former boss Bob Diamond in 2012.
- It now closely monitors bankers' texts, phone calls and online chat conversations while they are at work to ensure no rules are broken. The bank has an artificial intelligence system which checks messages for concerning signs.
- A Barclays spokesman said: “We always intended to listen to colleague feedback as part of this limited pilot which was intended to tackle issues such as individual over-working as well as raise general productivity.
- “In response to that colleague feedback we have taken steps to ensure that no individual data is visible to managers.”

- Bank admits using tracking software to log how long staff spend away from their desks
- Barclays has been accused of “dystopian Big Brother” employment practices after it admitted running a staff monitoring scheme that uses tracking software to log how long employees spent at their desks and send warnings if they took extended breaks.
- The lender has been running a pilot programme at its London headquarters that measures staff productivity within its investment bank, by allowing managers to track when staff are at their desks or in certain computer applications. Time away from their desks for meetings and bathroom breaks could in some cases be counted against staff on their daily report cards.
- The software, created by US firm Sapience Analytics, offers tips to individuals who have started to fall behind on targets, suggesting they mute their phone, disable email and chat pop-ups and avoid taking breaks that last more than 20 minutes.
- CityAM, which first reported the trial, quoted one anonymous staff member as saying: “Employees are worried to step away from their desks, have full lunch breaks, take bathroom breaks or even get up for water, as we are not aware of the repercussions this might have on our statistics.”
- The Sapience website says its software “uses algorithms to analyse data and reveal work patterns. These insights are then shared with the team, department, or organisation.” It claims companies can use the figures to set goals, adjust negotiate contracts, cut spending and “engage low performers”.
- It is understood that Barclays was using the software for a number of months on an anonymised basis, but started piloting the collection of individual data in recent weeks.
- The trade union umbrella body the TUC described the use of the system as “dystopian Big Brother tactics that show a total disregard for hardworking staff”.
- Following a staff backlash, the bank said it would gather only anonymous, aggregated data about the employees it tracks through the software, rather than on an individual basis.
- A Barclays spokeswoman said: “We always intended to listen to colleague feedback as part of this limited pilot, which was intended to tackle issues such as individual over-working as well as raise general productivity. In response to that colleague feedback, we have taken steps to ensure that no individual data is visible to managers.”
- The lender came under pressure over similar privacy concerns in 2017 over its use of OccupEye sensors that tracked the movements of staff members through black boxes installed under their desks.
- The Guardian has contacted Sapience Analytics for comment.

- Have you ever felt that your boss was spying on you? Maybe she peeked over your shoulder to see if you’re really working or just scrolling through Twitter or Instagram. You might have caught her eavesdropping on an important call with a major client. Who hasn’t—from time to time—wondered if that guy from IT placed tracking software on your computer and everything you do is being monitored?
- If you work at Barclays, the large United Kingdom-based bank, you may have actually been spied upon and it's not just your imagination. Reuters reported that Barclays is being investigated by the Information Commissioner’s Office. The privacy agency is examining the big bank to see if the company spied on its employees.
- Back in August 2017, it was reported that Barclays installed software to allegedly find out if traders and bankers were sitting at their desks working or galavanting outside of the office. Employees started to notice a black box underneath their desks and questioned what was going on. It turned out the bank planted tracking devices called OccupEye, which is a heat and motion sensor. Employees believe Barclays implemented these devices to track how long they remained at their desks.
- The bank claimed that it wasn’t snooping on its people, stating, “The sensors aren’t monitoring people or their productivity; they are assessing office space usage. This sort of analysis helps us to reduce costs, for example, managing energy consumption, or identifying opportunities to further adopt flexible work environments.” Barclays is alleged to have used this software for about 18 months. The bank said that it was changing the system after receiving blowback and criticism.
- Banks have long used tools to watch over their employees. It's not just checking up to see if they are doing their jobs or spending too much time at the pub. In an effort to ensure that financial institutions are not taking advantage of customers or employees engaging in insider trading or violating the rules, their actions are closely scrutinized and monitored.
- Certain securities professionals are required to disclose their outside investments and business activities to ensure that there are no conflicts. Phone calls are monitored. Brokers, bankers, salespersons and traders have their activities regularly reviewed. Employees are told to take consecutive weeks of vacation to allow the bank time to see if they’ve been up to no good. This makes prudent sense, as it protects the customers, reputations of the banks and is used as a way to ensure that bankers, brokers and traders don't do anything wrong.
- A spokesperson from the regulator’s office said, “People expect that they can keep their personal lives private and that they are also entitled to a degree of privacy in the workplace. If organizations wish to monitor their employees, they should be clear about its purpose and that it brings real benefits.” The bank representative also added, “Organizations also need to make employees aware of the nature, extent and reasons for any monitoring.”
- Another large international bank, Credit Suisse, was deeply embroiled in its own spying scandal. Back in February, two high-profile executives became bitter rivals jockeying for better positions within the bank.
- One of the gentlemen decided to resign. It was alleged that private investigators were hired by Credit Suisse to spy on the former senior-level executive. In one wild instance, the bank was accused of having the departed executive followed. He was alleged to have been tailed by private security. As the former executive, along with his wife, drove through the streets of Zurich, they were followed by another car. This led to a confrontation, which was reported to Credit Suisse. This resulted in the employment of a senior manager at the bank—supposedly behind the espionage—getting terminated. A private investigator killed himself and the CEO stepped down.
- On a less grandiose level, now that millions of Americans are working from home, there’s concern that companies will be spying on them. The New York Times reported, “Demand has surged for software that can monitor employees, with programs tracking the words we type, snapping pictures with our computer cameras and giving our managers rankings of who is spending too much time on Facebook and not enough on Excel.”
- The remote worker referenced in the article shared his experience, “Last month, I downloaded employee-monitoring software made by Hubstaff, an Indianapolis company. Every few minutes, it snapped a screenshot of the websites I browsed, the documents I was writing and the social media sites I visited. From my phone, it mapped where I went, including a two-hour bike ride that I took around Battersea Park with my kids in the middle of one workday. (Whoops.)”
- “Employees who are now subject to new levels of surveillance report being both ‘incredibly stressed out’ by the constant monitoring and also afraid to speak up, a recipe for not only dissatisfaction but also burnout, both of which—ironically—decrease productivity,” wrote the Harvard Business Review.
- According to the Los Angeles Times, companies have been scrambling as “they’re trying to allow their employees to work from home, but trying to maintain a level of security and productivity.”
- A spokesperson for a financial services firm that uses surveillance software justifies the organization’s decision, asserting, “The enhanced monitoring of at-home employees we implemented will ensure that those members of our workforce who work from home will continue to meet quality and productivity standards that are expected from all workers.”
- As you’re dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress during the pandemic, now it seems you might have to be concerned that your company is always watching you too.
