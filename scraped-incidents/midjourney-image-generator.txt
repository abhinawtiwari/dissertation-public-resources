- Midjourney is a subscription-based AI programme created by a company of the same name that creates images from textual descriptions. Similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, Midjourney has been available in open beta since its launch in July 2022 via a Discord bot on its official Discord.
- In March 2023, Midjourney version 5 was released, significantly improving the quality of images depicting people. The same month, the company announced it was stopping free trials of its technology citing a massive influx of new users abusing free credits.
- Midjourney has been praised for the variety and quality of the images it produces and, according to its CEO David Holz, is already profitable. But it has also met with criticism and resistance:
- Copyright: Midjourney and similar AI image generation tools have been heavily criticised for being trained on human-made art scraped from the web, and copied or remixed without attribution. The San Francisco Ballet was accused of IP theft after it had used a Midjourney-generated image to promote its annual Nutcracker production. Ammaar Reeshi drew the ire of artists and illustrators for creating childrens book Alice and Sparkle over a single weekend using Midjourney. The US Copyright Office ruled that Midjourney-generated images used in the comic book Zarya of the Dawn should not have been granted copyright protection. Midjourney and similar services also faced public backlashes from prominent art communities and artists.
- Employment: Artists lamented Jason Allen's first place at the Colorado State Fair's fine art competition, seeing his use of Midjourney as accelerating the death of creative jobs. Atlantic journalist Charlie Warzel's use of a Midjourney-created image of InfoWars provocateur Alex Jones prompted people to accuse the magazine of eliminating the need for illustrators and cutting costs.
- Mis/disinformation: The realism of images generated by Midjourney, notably by version 5, has made it easier to fool people into believing they are real. Fake images of the Pope donning a white puffa jacket, and of Donald Trump being arrested, are the first mainstream examples.
- Safety: While Midjourney is generally considered safer than Stable Diffusion, DALL-E and other image generation systems, it has still proved possible to produce images of pornstars and other NSFW content. In February 2023, Midjourney attempted to block porn by banning words about the human reproductive system.
- Privacy: David Holz outraged artists, illustrators and photographers by confessing to using hundreds of millions of images Midjourney didn’t have permission for to train its AI image generator.
- Artists can request their work to be removed from the dataset if they believe their copyright has been infringed. However, Midjourney only introduced this feature after artists complained, and then made it challenging for artists to remove their work by burying the information in the app terms of service.

- Jason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now, his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.
- In August, Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image, titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”), was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.
- “I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it,” Allen, 39, told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.
- Allen’s winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.
- The definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.
- Midjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord, while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation, and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.
- The newness of these tools, how they’re used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.
- This came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.
- “This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics,” one Twitter user wrote.
- “This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’,” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”
- Yet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.
- “It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions,” he said.
- AI made these stunning images. Here's why experts are worried
- You can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds, but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.
- First, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said. Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.
- Allen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.
- “Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it,” Allen said.
- Cal Duran, an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition, said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney, he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still, he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category, he said, calling it a “beautiful piece”.
- “I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way,” he said.
- Allen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.

- When Jason Allen submitted his “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” into the Colorado State Fair’s fine arts competition last week, the sumptuous print was an immediate hit, beating 20 other artists in the “digitally manipulated photography” category to win the first-place blue ribbon and a $300 prize.
- What Allen had only hinted at, however, was that the artwork had been created in large part by an artificial-intelligence tool, Midjourney, that can generate realistic images at a user’s command. The portrait of three figures, dressed in flowing robes, staring out to a bright beyond, was so finely detailed the judges couldn’t tell.
- Allen’s piece offers a clear example of how rapidly AI-generated art has advanced. Trained on billions of internet images, the systems have decisively pushed the boundaries of what computers can create.
- But it has also sparked a massive debate over the meaning of art, with Allen facing accusations that he had been deceptive in beating out other human artists with something he asked a machine to create.
- Text-to-image tools like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney have quickly increased in sophistication and become one of the hottest topics in AI. They can generate not just fake people, objects and locations but mimic entire visual styles. Users can demand the art piece look like a cartoon storybook or a historical diagram or an Associated Press photograph, and the system will do its best to oblige.
- But AI-generated art has been criticized as automated plagiarism, because it relies on millions of ingested art pieces that are then parroted en masse. It has also fueled deeper fears: of decimating people’s creative work, blurring the boundaries of reality or smothering human art.
- Allen said his art piece shows people need to “get past their denial and fear” of a technology that could empower new inventions and reshape our world. The AI, he said, “is a tool, just like the paintbrush is a tool. Without the person, there is no creative force.”
- But he also struck a note of defiance at the critics he believed did not appreciate the profound message in his AI-generated art.
- “You said AI would never be as good as you, that AI would never do the work you do, and I said, ‘Oh really? How about this? I won,’” he said. “It’s here now. Recognize it. Stop denying the reality. AI isn’t going away.”
- ***
- Allen, 39, lives south of his hometown of Colorado Springs and runs a company, Incarnate Games, that makes tabletop fantasy games. He went into the Air Force after high school and got a computer science degree at a Colorado technical school. He does not consider himself an artist and had never entered an arts competition before.
- Earlier this year, he said, he started noticing people posting more AI art on social media, but he had been initially skeptical to try it himself due to “spiritual reasons.” Elon Musk, he remembered, had compared AI to “summoning the demon,” and the practice felt like it could be “a gateway into communicating with the unknown.”
- “That’s what it feels like. This isn’t being created by a human,” Allen said Thursday while watching a jiujitsu tournament in Las Vegas. “There’s a lot to be said about the spiritual meddling of our reality. They would use anything they could to influence humanity.”
- But the art was just so intricate, he said, that he couldn’t stop thinking about it. He started playing with AI-powered art tools: WOMBO Dream, NightCafe, starryai. Then, someone invited him to Midjourney, and he became obsessed.
- The Google engineer who thinks the company’s AI has come to life
- Midjourney has become one of the most popular AI art generators largely because it allows anyone to freely create new images on command. Using the prompt “/imagine,” a user can type in whatever they want to see and the AI will return four newly created images in 60 seconds. The user can also ask the AI to improve, or “upscale,” the visual quality with new variations on the same idea.
- The start-up, which calls itself “an independent research lab … expanding the imaginative powers of the human species,” operates largely out of a 1-million-follower network on the chat service Discord, with rooms devoted to character creation, environments and “show and tell.”
- After paying for a corporate account, Allen started generating thousands of images, changing the text prompts with every creation. He experimented with new settings, scenarios and effects. He asked for images in the styles of Leonardo da Vinci and the American psychedelic artist Alex Grey.
- The pieces that really caught his attention, though, were what he now calls his “space opera theater” series. He started with a simple mental image — “a woman in a Victorian frilly dress, wearing a space helmet” — and kept fine-tuning the prompts, “using tests to really make an epic scene, like out of a dream.” He said he spent 80 hours making more than 900 iterations of the art, adding words like “opulent” and “lavish” to fine tune its tone and feel. He declined to share the full series of words he used to create his art, saying it is his artistic product, and that he intends to publish it later. “If there’s one thing you can take ownership of, it’s your prompt,” he said.
- “I was like: Dude,” he said. “This is so sick! I want to see more of it! I’m addicted! I’m obsessed!”
- When he found images he really liked, he pulled them into Adobe Photoshop to remove visual artifacts. In one image, the central figure was missing a head, so he also painted in a crop of dark, wavy hair. He used another machine-learning tool, Gigapixel AI, to increase the photos’ quality and sharpness, then printed the three pieces on canvas — all variations on the French phrase for “space opera theater,” which he thought sounded cool — and drove to submit them to the state fair.
- When he looked at the pieces, he said, he saw “a supernatural reality … something we haven’t even been able to experience yet, past the great beyond.” But the pace of AI art is moving perhaps even faster than the internet. “You’re looking at art from a month ago,” he added. “In technology terms, that’s decades. This piece is antiquated compared to what Midjourney is doing now.”
- ***
- The state fair in Pueblo, Colo., was an unlikely place for the writing of a new chapter in art history. The 150-year-old festival, known for its horse and livestock competitions, runs a series of more traditional art competitions, including for homemade dolls, quilts, porcelain art and needlework, as well as for the best canned carrots, medicinal remedies and holiday breads.
- Of the 596 entries in the “fine arts” competition, 21 amateur “emerging artists” submitted pieces of “digitally manipulated photography,” one of the fair’s newest categories. Asked what art materials he had used, Allen told state fair officials only that he used Midjourney — though he did not exactly go into detail, and no one seems to have asked.
- One of the judges, Dagny McKinley, an author and art historian who runs a playwright festival in nearby Steamboat Springs, remembers walking past Allen’s canvas and being immediately drawn to a piece that felt reminiscent of Renaissance art.
- “It had an immediate story: People looking out into another world, everyone with their backs to you, no one facing or engaging with the viewers,” she said. “You get interested: What are they seeing?”
- McKinley said she did not realize the art was AI-generated but said it wouldn’t have changed her judgment anyway; Allen, she said, “had a concept and a vision he brought to reality, and it’s really a beautiful piece.”
- Sebastian Smee, The Washington Post’s art critic, said the piece’s textures and lighting are reminiscent of Gustave Moreau, a late 19th-century artist, associated with the Decadents, who influenced Edgar Degas and Henri Matisse. (He also recalled a quote from the artist Sol LeWitt, who said, “The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.”)
- When Allen announced his victory himself on Midjourney’s Discord channel, saying he had spent “many weeks of fine tuning and curating,” the responses spiraled between muted excitement to outright dread. In a chat board devoted to philosophical debates, one user compared the win to “entering a marathon and driving a Lamborghini to the finish line.” Another user wrote that the “stunt” threatened to “get this tool banned and hated even more.”
- Ready or not, mass video deepfakes are coming
- The win also triggered a flood of rage online. A tweet expressing profane dismay at Allen’s win has been liked more than 85,000 times. Another person tweeted, “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes.” Allen said he has also gotten “a lot of very nasty hate” in his online inboxes; on his game company’s Instagram profile, one user said he should return his award and “post a public apology before some MAJOR backlash comes your way.”
- Some of the frustration has come from how the tools were built: a similar tool, Stable Diffusion, was “trained” on 2 billion images taken from the internet, including from personal blogs and amateur-art sites like Flickr and DeviantArt.
- Allen, however, dismisses the point as shallow: “Where did you learn how to do your art? You looked at art. Whose art was it? You learned their techniques, you studied their art, you added it to your repertoire,” he said.
- Allen listed the pieces for $750 each, he said, and two were sold at the fair to unknown buyers, though he now frets that he should have charged far more, given that it could be “essentially a piece of art history.” On Discord, some users asked whether he should have been more explicit, to which Allen replied: “Did I have to?”
- Despite the online furor, Allen’s neighbors seemed more sanguine about adapting to AI. As far as anyone at the Colorado Department of Agriculture can tell, Allen did not break any rules. Pieces for the category are only required to involve “technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Digital filters, color-manipulation tools and the “recombination of images” are all expressly allowed.
- No one has filed an official grievance over the result, either, department spokeswoman Olga Robak said, though there has been an unrelated dispute in the fair’s goat-shearing contest.
- Robak, who studied art history, finds the controversy fascinating. “People put bananas on the wall and called it art,” she said. “Even photography was not considered an art form for a long time; people said it was just pushing a button, and now we realize it’s about composition, color, light. Who are we to say that AI is not the same way?”
- Don’t ask if the duct-tape banana is art. Ask if it’s any good.
- ***
- Jessica Hair, a 25-year-old receptionist at a doctor’s office who won third place in the competition, said she did not feel Allen had acted unfairly and had no hard feelings about his win.
- Hair said her “Judge, Jury, Executioner,” which depicts a tuxedoed skeleton on a golden throne surrounded by skulls, took 15 hours to create with a stylus on an iPad Pro. But Allen’s piece took time, effort and subjective judgment, too, and “how do we qualify what is and isn’t art?” she said.
- She did wonder, though, if it might have broken the fair’s rules requiring all art to have been made by Colorado residents. Would the AI, wherever it exists, qualify?
- McKinley, the contest judge, said she understands the frustrations from some artists feeling spurned in their craft, and she believes the festival should consider a category purely devoted to AI art. But she sees such technology as opening up a new world of possibilities for artists — and as something it’d be better to embrace, since it isn’t going away.
- “It’s not going to take away from a beautiful painting or a sculpture you can touch,” she said. “It’s just one more tool we have to advance what we can create.”
- Gregory Block, an oil painter in Denver who was not a part of the competition, said he finds it hard to imagine an AI generator supplanting the hundreds of hours — and all the “heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears” — he’s invested into his art. But he also thinks back to the artists that first inspired him, who used rudimentary devices like the camera lucida, in the 1800s, to aid their own designs.
- “That was thought of as cheating, too,” he said. “Yet they used it to make these incredible paintings: anatomically correct figures, beautiful soft lighting. … Those steps in technology are elemental to our art. Otherwise, we’d still be doing cave paintings with just our hands and blood.”
- The AI, he said, can imbue the art with a mysterious beauty, made all the more special because it is so hard to understand. But “the soul any of us can find in a piece of artwork, the emotion, the human struggle we identify with in art is always our own.”
- “It doesn’t have to necessarily be created out of a human soul, the artwork itself. It is for us to see and react to,” Block said. “We the viewers are, in the end, the ultimate artists. We’re the ones creating the world that is coming in through our eyeballs. That world is in our mind.”

- Where will we draw the line between human-generated art and AI-generated art?
- Can AI make art?
- If so, should we bestow the acclaimed title of artisan upon said AI?
- Great questions.
- Let’s unpack things and see where the world stands on these mind-bending concerns. A crucial undercurrent has to do with AI Ethics and how we as a society perceive and want to make use of AI. For my ongoing and extensive coverage of AI Ethics and Ethical AI, see the link here and the link here, just to name a few.
- News stories this past few days have made AI and art an extremely hot topic.
- You see, the whole conundrum about Artificial Intelligence and art was recently thrust into the public eye when an AI “artbot” seemingly won an art contest. The headlines regarding this matter have ranged from fervent outrage to a sense of sorrowful acquiescence that it was only a matter of time before AI would prevail in the creative field of artistry. Some even claim that we’ve already seen AI comeuppance in art and that there is nothing new in this latest occurrence other than it managed to touch a nerve on social media.
- Amid all the heated debate in general, there are a lot of facts about this latest incident that muddy the waters and tend to undercut the shallow headlines and vitriolic tweets that the story has generated. It might be useful to take a moment and calmly consider the actual specifics, which I will be doing throughout this discussion.
- Meanwhile, one perhaps beneficial outcome of the reported story is that AI Ethics managed to suddenly get some long overdue recognition in the media at large. Whenever an AI-themed man-bites-dog story hits the airwaves and goes viral on social media, public opinions start to weigh in. We will examine the various qualms and complaints expressed in the public discourse about this brewing AI Ethics riddle.
- First, let’s lay out the facts of the deemed newsworthy snowball that ultimately started a cantankerous snowfall avalanche.
- The Colorado State Fair is where the competition in this case took place. The Fair is an annual event that has a hearty 150-year-old tradition initially focused on livestock. An eventual expansion of activities included the inclusion of a fine arts contest. There is certainly nothing unusual about state fairs having art contests. It is a common occurrence these days.
- Entrants for the Colorado State Fair art contest must choose to enter either as an emerging artist considered to be an amateur or enter as a professional artist. This is clearly noted on the Colorado State Fair website:
- 
- 
- Given that the Fair has both an art competition and a livestock competition, the overarching rules of the Fair make this affirmative statement about the requirements for entry:
- 
- 
- A similar and slightly more specific rule is mentioned related to the Fine Arts competition:
- 
- 
- To try and ensure that the competitions are run in a good and balanced manner, there is an appeals process if an entrant is thought to have violated the rules:
- 
- 
- The Fair can decide to overturn an entry:
- 
- 
- Within the Fine Arts contest, there were these categories that covered the emerging artist entries:
- 
- 
- An official list of the winners in each category is posted online (list dated August 29, 2022).
- For the category of Digital Arts/Digitally-Manipulated Photography, the first-place winner is indicated as follows:
- 
- 
- This entry was considered a blue-ribbon first-place winner and received a competition prize of $300.
- The art entries were submitted in physical form (rather than being an online competition). Jason Allen, the above-mentioned winner of first place in the Digital Arts/Digitally-Manipulated Photography, had submitted three art pieces. An $11 submission fee was paid for each one. The three pieces had been each composed on a computer and the final results that Jason favored were then printed onto canvas by him so that the artworks could be physically submitted to the Colorado State Fair art competition.
- All in all, everything would seem to be straightforward and without any controversy.
- Here’s how the brouhaha got underway.
- Turns out that the aforementioned first-place winner Jason Allen opted to subsequently make known online that he had used an AI program referred to as Midjourney for creating his winning art piece. That vociferously got the ball rolling on raising the roof of this otherwise innocuous art piece.
- The art piece that was generated appears uncontroversial in terms of its looks. Envision photo-realistic imagery consisting of three robe-wearing human figures looking out toward a large shining orb (well, this is a somewhat crude text-based description that admittedly does not do justice to the vibrancy of the art piece). The gist here is that the art piece itself is not a source of controversy in terms of how it looks, what it suggests, or anything at all about the contents of the art.
- The key to the controversy is that this winning art piece was seemingly crafted via the use of an AI art-generating program.
- This deserves a quick introductory rundown of what those AI art-generating programs are all about.
- You might vaguely be aware that a slew of AI programs that seek to generate art has been having a heyday of recent note. AI art-generating programs that have garnered some notoriety include OpenAI’s DALL-E and DALL-E 2, Google’s Imagen, and others such as WOMBO, NightCafe, and now particularly Midjourney partially arising from this controversy (though, note that an estimated over 1 million followers are on the Midjourney Discord channel).
- Some of these AI programs will generate an art piece without any input required by a human to initiate or shape what the art is supposed to look like. Others allow a human to provide a starter indication such as by entering text. There are also some that will take a human-provided sketch or similar kind of artistic rendering and will seek to morph or further transform the starter into an artistic variant.
- In addition to allowing a starter prompt of sorts, there are AI art-producing programs that allow a human to adjust the art while the AI is in the midst of generating the art. For example, you might provide a starter prompt such as “contains dogs and cats” and then when the AI shows an initial art piece to you, you can then mention other facets that come to mind such as “wearing hats” that the AI would then adjust the being-generated art accordingly.
- Generally, AI art-generating programs tend to have these facets:
- 
- 
- You might be wondering why AI art-generating programs have risen in newsworthiness. There have been AI art-generating programs nearly since the beginning of the advent of AI systems going back to the 1950s and 1960s. This is assuredly nothing new.
- The latest twist is that the current crop of AI art-generating programs tends to make use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to perform their art-producing results.
- This also brings us to the realm of AI Ethics.
- All of this also relates to soberly emerging concerns about today’s AI and especially the use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning as a form of technology and how it is being utilized. You see, there are uses of ML/DL that tend to involve having the AI be anthropomorphized by the public at large, believing or choosing to assume that the ML/DL is either sentient AI or near to (it is not). In addition, ML/DL can contain aspects of computational pattern matching that are undesirable or outright improper, or illegal from ethics or legal perspectives.
- It might be useful to first clarify what I mean when referring to AI overall and also provide a brief overview of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. There is a great deal of confusion as to what Artificial Intelligence connotes. I would also like to introduce the precepts of AI Ethics to you, which will be especially integral to the remainder of this discourse.
- Stating the Record About AI
- Let’s make sure we are on the same page about the nature of today’s AI.
- There isn’t any AI today that is sentient.
- We don’t have this.
- We don’t know if sentient AI will be possible. Nobody can aptly predict whether we will attain sentient AI, nor whether sentient AI will somehow miraculously spontaneously arise in a form of computational cognitive supernova (usually referred to as The Singularity, see my coverage at the link here).
- Realize that today’s AI is not able to “think” in any fashion on par with human thinking. When you interact with Alexa or Siri, the conversational capacities might seem akin to human capacities, but the reality is that it is computational and lacks human cognition. The latest era of AI has made extensive use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, which leverage computational pattern matching. This has led to AI systems that have the appearance of human-like proclivities. Meanwhile, there isn’t any AI today that has a semblance of common sense and nor has any of the cognitive wonderment of robust human thinking.
- Part of the issue is our tendency to anthropomorphize computers and especially AI. When a computer system or AI seems to act in ways that we associate with human behavior, there is a nearly overwhelming urge to ascribe human qualities to the system. It is a common mental trap that can grab hold of even the most intransigent skeptic about the chances of reaching sentience.
- To some degree, that is why AI Ethics and Ethical AI is such a crucial topic.
- The precepts of AI Ethics get us to remain vigilant. AI technologists can at times become preoccupied with technology, particularly the optimization of high-tech. They aren’t necessarily considering the larger societal ramifications. Having an AI Ethics mindset and doing so integrally to AI development and fielding is vital for producing appropriate AI, including the assessment of how AI Ethics gets adopted by firms.
- Besides employing AI Ethics precepts in general, there is a corresponding question of whether we should have laws to govern various uses of AI. New laws are being bandied around at the federal, state, and local levels that concern the range and nature of how AI should be devised. The effort to draft and enact such laws is a gradual one. AI Ethics serves as a considered stopgap, at the very least, and will almost certainly to some degree be directly incorporated into those new laws.
- Be aware that some adamantly argue that we do not need new laws that cover AI and that our existing laws are sufficient. They forewarn that if we do enact some of these AI laws, we will be killing the golden goose by clamping down on advances in AI that proffer immense societal advantages. See for example my coverage at the link here.
- In prior columns, I’ve covered the various national and international efforts to craft and enact laws regulating AI, see the link here, for example. I have also covered the various AI Ethics principles and guidelines that various nations have identified and adopted, including for example the United Nations effort such as the UNESCO set of AI Ethics that nearly 200 countries adopted, see the link here.
- Here's a helpful keystone list of Ethical AI criteria or characteristics regarding AI systems that I’ve previously closely explored:
- 
- 
- Those AI Ethics principles are earnestly supposed to be utilized by AI developers, along with those that manage AI development efforts, and even those that ultimately field and perform upkeep on AI systems. All stakeholders throughout the entire AI life cycle of development and usage are considered within the scope of abiding by the being-established norms of Ethical AI. This is an important highlight since the usual assumption is that “only coders” or those that program the AI are subject to adhering to the AI Ethics notions. As prior emphasized herein, it takes a village to devise and field AI, and for which the entire village has to be versed in and abide by AI Ethics precepts.
- Let’s keep things down to earth and focus on today’s computational non-sentient AI.
- ML/DL is a form of computational pattern matching. The usual approach is that you assemble data about a decision-making task. You feed the data into the ML/DL computer models. Those models seek to find mathematical patterns. After finding such patterns, if so found, the AI system then will use those patterns when encountering new data. Upon the presentation of new data, the patterns based on the “old” or historical data are applied to render a current decision.
- I think you can guess where this is heading. If humans that have been making the patterned upon decisions have been incorporating untoward biases, the odds are that the data reflects this in subtle but significant ways. Machine Learning or Deep Learning computational pattern matching will simply try to mathematically mimic the data accordingly. There is no semblance of common sense or other sentient aspects of AI-crafted modeling per se.
- Furthermore, the AI developers might not realize what is going on either. The arcane mathematics in the ML/DL might make it difficult to ferret out the now hidden biases. You would rightfully hope and expect that the AI developers would test for the potentially buried biases, though this is trickier than it might seem. A solid chance exists that even with relatively extensive testing that there will be biases still embedded within the pattern matching models of the ML/DL.
- You could somewhat use the famous or infamous adage of garbage-in garbage-out. The thing is, this is more akin to biases-in that insidiously get infused as biases submerged within the AI. The algorithm decision-making (ADM) of AI axiomatically becomes laden with inequities.
- Not good.
- I believe that I’ve now set the table to adequately examine the controversy about the winning entry of Jason Allen’s “Théâtre D'opéra Spatial” at the Colorado State Fair art competition.
- Getting Riled Up About AI-Produced Art
- Let’s tackle some of the outsized anger and pitchfork waving that has arisen on this matter.
- First, some on social media insisted that Jason Allen “cheated” by using an AI art-generating program. This is supposed to be human hand-crafted art, some loudly proclaimed. Art in an art competition is about humankind and the creative artistic spark of humanity and the human soul.
- In response to these raucous accusations, and as reported widely in the news reports of this story, Jason Allen reacted by saying this: "I’m not going to apologize for it. I won and I didn’t break any rules."
- Generally, the professed claim that things were done strictly by the book does seem to be the case.
- Recall earlier the excerpted rules of the Colorado State Fair. As per the rules, Jason submitted the artworks in a requisite manner, having submitted them in physical form and paying the submission fees.
- Furthermore, keep in mind that the category chosen was Digital Arts/Digitally-Manipulated Photography which encompasses by contest intent that the art is supposed to include some technological involvement as part of the creative or presentation process. For example, digital filters are allowed, color manipulation is allowed, recombining of images is allowed, and so on.
- If Jason had submitted the art to one of the other categories that were not technologically overtly proclaimed, it would seem that having angst about the submission would be relatively warranted and be a presumed violation of the rules. But that’s not what happened.
- Jason moreover claimed in interviews that the piece was labeled upon entry as having been crafted in affiliation with the use of Midjourney. That seemed to have been an added gesture on his part that was not necessitated by the rules per se (there didn’t appear to be rules requiring a stipulation of what technology had been used for the art effort).
- Reporters that later interviewed this particular category of art judges reported that the judges did not know what Midjourney was. The judges said that it made no difference to them not knowing what Midjourney was. By the nature of the rules of the competition, the art piece was allowed, and they deemed it meritorious artistry.
- Remember too that there is an appeals process for those that believe that an entrant didn’t abide by the rules. No appeals on this specific situation were apparently filed. Also, recall that the management of the Fair can opt to vacate an entry, but this entry was not vacated.
- So, we can reasonably conclude that as to the rules of the art competition, this art piece was not a cheater.
- That being said, an indignant outburst to the assertion that the rules were obeyed was met with hostility by some. They generally contended that no matter what the rules were, the fact that an AI art-generating program was used made this into a far larger kind of cheating. In that sense, cheating was not simply about meeting or not meeting the rules of the Fair. The cheating was a macroscopic big-picture that the artwork was accomplished by the AI and supposedly not by a human.
- We need to give that aggressive claim some scrutiny.
- Before we do so, a call to arms by some has been making the rounds, namely that art competitions henceforth should explicitly ban the use of AI as being used in any fashion whatsoever in the artworks being submitted. The idea is that if the “normal” rules aren’t catching this allegedly devious and underhanded AI usage, we need to upgrade the rules to a modern era by directly excluding any AI-related use.
- I would just like to note that having such a ban is likely to be problematic.
- AI capabilities are gradually being infused into all manner of apps. You might not know that an AI component is working inside an app. Thus, if you perchance use any kind of app to aid in your art production, the chances are that you might very well be violating an AI ban. Imagine your chagrin if you thought you had carefully followed the rules, and subsequently, your artwork was vacated because some tiny bit of AI was within an obscure app that you tangentially relied upon.
- One can almost envision your competitors eagerly willing to file an appeal about your winning entry. They might know that there is say an AI element in the operating system of your smartphone or laptop system which you used generically as a means to create your art piece. Your masterpiece gets tossed out. All is fair in love and war, as they say.
- To some degree, this matter about using technology is already somewhat covered by many existing rules anyway. In the case of the Colorado State Fair, note that the Digital Art/Digitally-Manipulated Photography category encompassed the use of high-tech. Trying to add an additional dividing line between tech that uses AI versus tech that doesn’t use AI is going to be a fine line of almost an indistinguishable minutia.
- In short, AI would seem to be something that is going to continue to arise in art, and attempts to ban AI use in art competitions would be difficult to define and enforce.
- Some suggest we go the other route, specifically naming AI as a particular category all its own. Call this AI Art or AI-Generated Art, something along those lines (I’m sure there will be catchier names coined).
- This might placate both parties of those that want human-only non-AI categories and categories that have AI-allowed provisos. Allow entrants to choose between using an AI-included category or using an AI-excluded category. This might be done on an honor system, though a flagrant violation would seemingly need to be properly handled.
- Speaking of flagrant violations, you know how contrarian people can be.
- There would be some that will opt to intentionally place an AI-generated art piece into the non-AI category, doing so because they are perhaps a troublemaker or are trying to make some urgently believed point about the world we live in. You will have others that will place a non-AI-generated art piece into the AI-produced category. Why? Likely because they are going to argue that we cannot let AI take over our art and it is wrong to exclude human-derived art from any category, even if a category is purposely arranged just for AI.
- Round and round this will go.
- Let’s return to the pending point that perhaps Jason Allen was “cheating” in that despite having obeyed the rules of the Fair, the submission of an AI-generated art piece goes wildly and widely beyond the rules of any particular competition. There are rules of society at play. Those societal rules are far and above the mundane or pedestrian rules of a specific art competition.
- This is a kind of cheating on a loftier worldview caliber, one might contend.
- This takes us down a bit of an abyss, but we need to go there.
- Start with the aspect that the AI system did not on its own create the art piece.
- Some mistakenly believe that Jason Allen merely slapped his name onto an AI-generated art piece, which they (mistakenly believe) were entirely and exclusively crafted by the AI. You might then even claim that this was a “cheat” in the sense that he wasn’t the true author or artist of the work (we will soon get into the authorship aspects, hang onto your hat).
- According to news reports, Jason Allen indicated that he entered text prompts that generated the art in Midjourney. He indicated that this was done over and over again, each time he was assessing whether the art looked as he wanted it to look, and then subsequently entered new prompts. Some 900 versions or variants were generated over time, purportedly. He has held secret the text prompts that he used, vowing to use them again.
- Back to the elbow grease aspects of the artwork, Jason Allen said he took the near-final art pieces from Midjourney and then used Photoshop to make additional changes, along with using some other detailed bit manipulation tools. All told, he suggested that the effort required 80 hours of his personal efforts in arriving at the final pieces.
- This was not a push-button operation.
- You can persuasively argue that human touch was demonstrably involved in this case. The artist iteratively devised the art. It was not an exclusively AI-only activity.
- Indeed, one rather compelling argument is that this is seemingly no different than using straight-out photography. We pretty much have accepted photography in art competitions since the emergence of photographic capabilities (kind of, there was a lot of consternation at the start). The usual assumption is that the artist will in fact be influencing the color, focus, and other salient aspects of a photo. The use of an AI art-generating program in this context does not seem afield from the same act of utilizing conventional photographic equipment and technology.
- Did the human artist provide sufficient added artistry to overcome an assertion that the art was done by the AI?
- In this case, the reported human-crafting effort does seem relatively substantive.
- We have them knocked down the claims of “cheating” that were related to the rules of the Fair, and likewise perhaps reasonably undercut qualms about lacking a human touch. This was artistry being done by a human artist that just so happened to use a variety of tools.
- Now the slippery slope comes into the picture.
- Suppose that Jason Allen had only used only five hours to create the artwork. Is that enough time to assuage concerns about the AI doing too much of the artistry? Imagine that he did the artwork in 5 minutes. How does that seem? In 5 seconds?
- What if he didn’t do any of the artistry per se at all and merely ran an app that essentially self-generated the art?
- Some would argue that if he ran the app, and despite doing nothing else such as entering prompts, he deserves to still be coined as the artist of the work generated. That makes the skin crawl on many.
- The eyebrow-raising belief by some is that invoking the app, is an artistic act.
- By then opting to choose to use the produced art by entering it into an art competition, this is also an artistic act of selecting the art that meets the artist's tastes.
- There you go, two artistic acts by the human artist.
- Murky waters. Angering contentions. Hogwash, some say. Art takes a lot more than running an app and selecting the output, they exhort.
- What then is the minimum requirement for the amount of human effort that is needed to stake an unambiguous claim that artwork was of human artistry?
- Quite a conundrum.
- We next shift into the question of the artistry of AI.
- In this case, a human ran an AI art-generating program. The human opted to enter the art into an art competition. The human took credit for the art piece.
- That generates heartburn for some.
- You might try to argue that the AI program deserves credit. Our art competition seeking humans is “cheating” by turning in the artwork of someone or something else.
- Suppose a person asks another person to paint a beauteous mountainous painting. We would be summarily shocked and quite upset if the first person turned in the art piece of this second person, doing so as the claimed artist of the work. Even if the first person casually mentioned that they had leaned into using the artistry skills of the second person, we still would not likely buy into the art ownership contention of the first person.
- Recast that scenario by placing AI into the role of the second person (in a broad sense, without being anthropomorphic). The first person, the human, tries to take credit for the artistry of the second entity, the AI. It would seem that this analogous situation suggests that we are unfairly ascribing true artistry. The AI ought to get the credit.
- Problems ensue.
- Realize that today’s AI is not sentient. If the AI was sentient, we certainly would seem to have due cause to be upset over the human taking credit for the work of the AI. There is a wide-ranging theoretical debate about what we are going to do if AI does reach sentience. Will we allow AI to have legal personhood? Maybe we won’t, maybe we will. Some suggest that we might decide to treat sentient AI as a form of enslavement, see my analysis at the link here.
- Perhaps AI will decide personhood for us, such as deciding that humankind has to provide AI with personhood, or else. There are many arguing that AI is an existential risk and we might eventually see AI that rules the world, including enslaving humans or wiping out humankind entirely, see my discussion at the link here.
- Until or if we ever reach AI sentience, we meanwhile still have an open question about the dividing line between what the AI does versus what humans do.
- Perhaps our attention as to the source of credit ought to look elsewhere.
- The AI developers, for instance.
- You might insist that the AI developers that made the AI art-generating program should get the artistry credit. Thus, anyone trying to submit artwork to an art competition for which the art piece was done by an AI art-generating program has to explicitly name the AI developers as the artists. It isn’t clear what the submitter gets out of this arrangement.
- Should all of the accolades and art prizes go solely to those indomitable AI developers?
- One supposes we could try to come up with an apportionment scheme. If the AI-produced art was augmented by the efforts of the human running the app, maybe the AI developers get 20% of the credit and the artist doing the augmenting gets 80%. It all depends on how much the artist did while rendering the art and finalizing the art. Ergo, it could be 80% to the artist and 20% to the AI developers, or any other split as discernable.
- But, some counterargue, you would need to do the same for photography. If you used a brand XYZ camera to take a photo, you would need to give credit to the camera-making company. Splitting the credit in such matters is not tenable, some point out. Forget it.
- Another angle is that the credit should go toward the artwork used to train the AI. In essence, if we crafted a Machine Learning or Deep Learning system by feeding a slew of artwork into the computational pattern matcher, we ought to give credit to those original artists.
- That seems to make sense.
- Sorry, it is more complicated than that.
- Suppose we feed artwork by Rembrandt, Picasso, Michelangelo, Monet, Vincent van Gogh, and many others into an ML/DL. All of this gets mushed together into a computational pattern-matching spiderweb. There is no longer a particular artist being patterned upon. We have contrived an artistic Frankenstein that melds and mixes the various styles and approaches.
- You come along and use this AI app. Your entry prompt is that you want a work of art containing dogs and cats wearing hats. The AI app produces art that looks breathtaking and amazing. It has a touch of Monet in it, a smidgeon of Rembrandt, and so on. Yes, encompasses dogs and cats wearing hats. I assure you it is magnificent.
- How do we give due credit to the array of artists that “contributed” to this wonderous art rendering?
- Perhaps some of the artists are living, while others are no longer with us. Also, even if a portion of the art rendering kind of abides by a particular artist's style, does that warrant giving that particular artist unfettered credit? Imagine trying to comb through artwork and piecemeal assign artistry rights to the elements that perchance seem to resemble a particular artist.
- A nightmare to try and aptly dissect.
- Now, I am sure that some of you are instantly getting your dander up about one aspect of this. Suppose the AI app is based on one specific artist. Assume the artist has not prior agreed to the use of their art for this AI app. Imagine there is an up-and-rising artist known as Amy. The only artwork fed into the ML/DL was the stunning works of Amy. The AI app is subsequently able to generate art never before produced by Amy yet looks precisely as though it was crafted by Amy.
- Yes, this does raise keen Intellectual Property (IP) rights issues.
- Legal and ethical questions abundantly arise.
- The Artistic Hornets’ Nest
- There is a lot more to uncover or shall we say put on display concerning this AI and art conundrum.
- Jason Allen indicated that this was the first time he had ever entered an art competition. Apparently, art was not a particular skill set of his. Lo and behold, he wins first place on his first-ever try (in the emerging artist realm, notably).
- Some lament that his winning entry was not due to his artistry but due to the artistry of the AI. In that sense, we are seemingly downgrading human artistry. A person that did not seemingly have artistic skills has miraculously out-the-gate won an art contest. The implication is that artists that are highly skilled and have honed their craft during many years of laborious practice are at a disadvantage.
- Just about anyone will become an artist, of a kind. All they need to do is write a few catchy texts prompts and an AI app will do the rest of the artistry chore for them. Gone will be any semblance of art skills as imbued in humankind and passed from generation to generation.
- We will outsource art and the making of art to AI.
- Taken to the extreme, the assertion is that art will inevitably become the exclusive domain of AI art-generating programs. Forget about humans creating art. Instead, all we will have left is AI that creates art. Think of it this way — why would you ask a human to from scratch create art for you? No justifiable reason to do so. Faster, cheaper, and maybe a better art product by using an AI app instead.
- All of this implies that human artists will be out of work. This means that AI is once again displacing workers. Perhaps we began with sweatshop workers on the assembly line that were being replaced by AI robots doing manual tasks on the factory floor. The even more unimaginable replacement would be replacing mind-expanding human artists that work based on the essence of the creative human spirit and endearing artistic soul.
- Yikes, if AI can replace artists, there is nothing sacred and nothing left to be spared.
- Wait for a second, some counterargue, do not toss out the baby with the bathwater (an old adage, probably worth retiring).
- Here’s the deal.
- Notably, the artwork of first-timer artist Jason Allen did indeed win in the selected category. The AI-augmented his artistic efforts. Without the AI, he probably would not have aimed at doing art and would not have submitted an art piece to the competition.
- The point is that AI will presumably encourage art in ways that will widen and expand the appreciation for and creation of art. More people will finally be tempted to try engaging in art. You might even claim that AI will democratize art (see my analysis about AI democratization aspects at the link here).
- Rather than having a selected few that proclaim to be artists, the population as a whole can relish in artistry. Young children that today might be discouraged from going into art because they are unable to seemingly produce viable art would be able to use an AI app that embellishes their unpolished attempts. They might completely change their otherwise sour opinions about art and stridently pursue and support art for the rest of their lives.
- None of this really has anything to do with human artists becoming extinct, you see. If anything, we will have more human artists than ever before. We will celebrate art in ways that have been opened up via the advent of AI.
- Art by human artists that are not using AI will still be available, possibly even savored. People will seek out art that was done solely by AI. They will seek out art done collaboratively by AI with human artists. And they might reserve as especially prized the artwork done by human artists that eschew the use of AI.
- Consider these categories:
- 
- 
- A zero-sum attitude proclaims that the third category will evaporate as the first two categories take hold. But another vision of the future is that the art field expands and within that growth, there is ample room for all three categories. In addition, it could be that the third category eventually becomes the most prized of them all. We could become bored or lose salient interest in the AI or AI-human jointly devised art and revert once again to art done entirely and only by human hand.
- Will AI take away artisan jobs?
- The usual answer is yes, namely that artists will become as scarce as hen’s teeth. The less considered answer is that AI will end up increasing artisan jobs and aid in the flourishing of art all told.
- Hard to say which path will prevail. There are the smiley face and the sad face options to be weighed.
- On a related tangent, some believe that AI-generated art is “unique” and provides an artistic flare outside that of everyday human artists. Human artists are said to be biased toward other human art and the acclaim associated with that human art. They are like cattle that herd along in the field of art. In contrast, AI won’t be emotionally preoccupied like human artists that seek human fellowship and recognition amongst their artisan peers.
- Be aware that this AI uniqueness of artistic panache has various holes.
- AI art generation can look quite similar to human art. This especially makes sense when you consider that much of the ML/DL is trained on human art instances. I dare say, you would often have a difficult time discerning which art is which.
- One of the notable reasons that people often describe AI-generated art as unique is because they are told it is AI-generated art. They get in their heads that wow, this was crafted by AI. It tends to guide their mindset toward thinking that art is unique.
- That’s not to say that some AI isn’t unique looking. It can be. Realize that the ML/DL might be algorithmically trained to push at the mathematical boundaries to try and produce art that is beyond the training set. This can seemingly generate unique-looking art.
- For the time being, there are going to be art judges and art critics that will swoon over AI-generated art. Sometimes the swooning might be fully justified. We might see the emergence of art styles that none have seen before. On the other hand, the novelty factor of the AI being part of the art-generating process can sway opinions too. A few handy AI artistry bonus points can be overtly or inadvertently assigned when AI-generated art is at the fore.
- One worthwhile contemplative thought is whether we will at some point see AI-generated art as being no longer quite so special. Perhaps the AI apps begin to converge and are not devised sufficiently to produce “unique” artwork anymore. Ho-hum, some might say, there’s another one of those AI artworks. The gimmick has run its course.
- I would not expect that to last very long if it does come to pass. I say this because the odds are that AI developers will keep trying to push ahead on making the AI art generation newer and newer. If people find the existing outputs dry or tedious, you can bet that there will be AI developers seeking to improve the AI accordingly.
- There will be a continual cat-and-mouse gambit between AI-generated art and human-generated art.
- Conclusion
- A longtime assertion is that art comes from the soul and reflects a spark of humanity and of being in the world. Under that umbrella assumption, a significant qualm about AI-generated art is that it lacks the soul or spirit, or spark of humankind.
- According to Pablo Picasso: “The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls.”
- If AI-generated art can do this, would we be wrong in claiming that AI isn’t producing art?
- As they say, art is in the eye of the beholder.
- Without being overly finicky, another wiggle room consideration is that if AI is developed by humans, you might argue that AI is a byproduct of the human soul. Therefore, the art generated by AI is embodying a semblance of the human spirit. This comes from the AI programming and the source artwork of humans as fed into the AI to train the system for generating art. Ugh, some retort, that’s not the same as an intrinsic human spirit involved in the actual moment-to-moment crafting of art.
- Ernest Hemingway said this: “In any art, you’re allowed to steal anything if you can make it better.”
- Does that imply that if AI-generated art is “stealing” human art and yet potentially making it “better” (those are argumentative claims, of course), are we to perhaps embrace AI-generated art with open arms?
- On a final note, for now, those that firmly believe that AI is an existential risk, are probably inclined to place AI-generated art somewhat low on the list of disconcerting priority items. AI that controls large-scale autonomous nuclear weapons is a lot higher. AI that becomes sentient and opts to control humanity or destroy us all, well, that’s worthy of top-notch attention. Sidenote: For true art lovers and especially those of a conspiratorial viewpoint, if we let AI take over our art, AI is surely going to go after our nuclear missiles and otherwise believe that humanity is a pushover in all regards. One naturally leads to the other, they would insist. Full stop, period.
- Anyway, we might end up with sentient AI that decides for us the nature of art. Hey, lowly humans, this is art, decree our AI overlords.
- Take it or leave it.
- Makes you wonder, will it be AI-generated art or human-produced art?
- As per the famous words of Anton Pavlovich Chekhov: “The role of the artist is to ask questions, not answer them.”

URL: https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvmvqm/an-ai-generated-artwork-won-first-place-at-a-state-fair-fine-arts-competition-and-artists-are-pissed
- A man came in first at the Colorado State Fair’s fine art competition using an AI generated artwork on Monday. “I won first place,” a user going by Sincarnate said in a Discord post above photos of the AI-generated canvases hanging at the fair.
- Sincarnate’s name is Jason Allen, who is president of Colorado-based tabletop gaming company Incarnate Games. According to the state fair’s website, he won in the digital art category with a work called “Théâtre D'opéra Spatial.” The image, which Allen printed on canvas for submission, is gorgeous. It depicts a strange scene that looks like it could be from a space opera, and it looks like a masterfully done painting. Classical figures in a Baroque hall stare through a circular viewport into a sun-drenched and radiant landscape.
- But Allen did not paint “Théâtre D'opéra Spatial,” AI software called Midjourney did. It used his prompts, but Allen did not wield a digital brush. This distinction has caused controversy on Twitter where working artists and enthusiasts accused Allen of hastening the death of creative jobs.
- “TL;DR — Someone entered an art competition with an AI-generated piece and won the first prize,” artist Genel Jumalon said in a viral tweet about Allen’s win. “Yeah that's pretty fucking shitty.”
- “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold before our eyes,” a Twitter user going by OmniMorpho said in a reply that gained over 2,000 likes. “If creative jobs aren’t safe from machines, then even high-skilled jobs are in danger of becoming obsolete. What will we have then?”
- “I knew this would be controversial,” Allen said in the Midjourney Discord server on Tuesday. “How interesting is it to see how all these people on Twitter who are against AI generated art are the first ones to throw the human under the bus by discrediting the human element! Does this seem hypocritical to you guys?”
- Motherboard reached out to Allen, who replied that he was embarking on a 12 hour drive and could not immediately comment.
- According to Allen, his input was instrumental to the shaping of the award winning painting. “I have been exploring a special prompt that I will be publishing at a later date, I have created 100s of images using it, and after many weeks of fine tuning and curating my gens, I chose my top 3 and had them printed on canvas after unshackling with Gigapixel AI,” he wrote in a post before the winners were announced.
- Allen said that his critics are judging the art by the method of its creation, and that eventually the art world will recognize AI-created art as its own category. “What if we looked at it from the other extreme, what if an artist made a wildly difficult and complicated series of restraints in order to create a piece, say, they made their art while hanging upside-down and being whipped while painting,” he said. “Should this artist’s work be evaluated differently than another artist that created the same piece ‘normally’? I know what will become of this in the end, they are simply going to create an ‘artificial intelligence art’ category I imagine for things like this.”
- Artists are concerned about the rise of AI-generated art. Atlantic writer Charlie Warzel went viral after running an edition of the magazine’s newsletter with a Midjourney-generated picture of Alex Jones. A major publication using AI for art instead of a human upset a lot of people. “Technology is increasingly deployed to make gig jobs and to make billionaires richer, and so much of it doesn't seem to benefit the public good enough,” cartoonist Matt Borrs told Warzel in a follow up piece. “AI art is part of that. To developers and technically minded people, it’s this cool thing, but to illustrators it’s very upsetting because it feels like you’ve eliminated the need to hire the illustrator.”
- Allen said he had clearly labeled his submission to the state fair as “Jason Allen via Midjourney,” and once again noted the human element required to produce the work. “I generate images with MJ, do passes with photoshop, and upscale with Gigapixel.”
- Despite the controversy, the win has only encouraged him. “I’m not stopping now,” he said. “This win has only emboldened my mission.”

- By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge.
- A game designer has sparked controversy after submitting an image created by an AI text-to-image generator to a state art competition and taking home first prize.
- Jason Allen entered the artwork titled “Theatre d’Opera Spatial” in the “Digital Arts / Digitally-Manipulated Photography” category of the Colorado State Fair fine arts competition but created the piece using a popular text-to-image AI generator named Midjourney.
- A Twitter post describing Allen’s win went viral earlier this week (and was first covered by Vice). The post elicited a strong response, with many users claiming that Allen had been deceptive in submitting the piece, particularly as most of the public is unaware of how text-to-image AI generators work. Allen, though, has defended his actions.
- “I wanted to make a statement using artificial intelligence artwork,” he told The Pueblo Chieftain. “I feel like I accomplished that, and I’m not going to apologize for it.” (The Verge contacted Allen via private message but received no response at time of publication.)
- Text-to-image AI systems are trained on billions of pairs of images and text descriptions, which they mine for visual patterns. Users then feed them text descriptions known as prompts, and the software generates an image that matches this description based on its training data.
- Although these systems have previously been the exclusive domain of well-funded tech companies like OpenAI and Google, they’ve become increasingly accessible in recent months. The system used by Allen, named Midjourney, is one of the most popular and known for its finely tuned aesthetics, which often mimic contemporary digital art styles.
- Midjourney itself is accessible through a Discord server, where users (including Allen, who goes by the handle Sincarnate) show off their artwork and swap tips on how to improve their outputs. Allen posted on Discord that he had won the competition last Friday, saying: “I’ve set out to make a statement using Midjourney in a competitive manner and wow! I could not be more excited about having won with my favorite piece.”
- Responses to Allen’s win, though, have been mixed, with many accusing him of deceiving the judges. From Allen’s description of his win, it seems that the fair’s judges were not fully aware of how the piece was created. Writing in the Midjourney Discord, Allen says the artwork’s “description clearly stated I created them via Midjourney,” but when another user asks if he explained what the software does, Allen replies, “Should I have explained what Midjourney was? If so, why?” eliciting face-palm emoji reactions from others in the chat.
- Allen said he’s been telling people at the show that the piece is “digital art created using a.i. tools” and that he doesn’t need to explain what Midjourney is any more than a digital artist might explain how Adobe Illustrator works. He also emphasizes the work he put into creating the image — “I made the prompt, I fine tuned it for many weeks, curated all the images” — and adds that his Photoshop editing constituted “at least 10%” of the work.
- The rules of the competition Allen entered describe his category only as “Artistic practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.”
- “I think most normies wouldn’t have chosen an AI picture to win if they knew”
- The denizens of Midjourney’s Discord have been debating the fairness of his actions. Users have praised the beauty of the artwork and Allen’s skill in its execution, but many suggested he should have been more upfront about the creation process. “I think most normies wouldn’t have chosen an AI picture to win if they knew,” said one user. “Just because it’s not mainstream and accepted yet.”
- Another said Allen’s arguments were disingenuous and that if the fair’s judges had been fully aware of his methods, he would not have been allowed to enter the competition. “If there was an AI art category i would be sending congratulations. But this whole thing sits in a gray area,” wrote another user. “I would bet a substantial sum that the judges would not have selected him as the winner knowing that he used a text to image generator.”
- Some, though, were more supportive, saying that the judges should have Googled Midjourney to find out how it worked or pointing out that Midjourney is just another digital art tool like Photoshop or Illustrator and that the piece was rightfully entered in the “Digital Arts / Digitally-Manipulated Photography” category.
- Olga Robak, director of communications at the Colorado Department of Agriculture, confirmed to The Pueblo Chieftain that Allen had indeed mentioned the use of Midjourney in his submission statement but did not say whether he’d explained how it works. Robak noted that the fair’s rules allowed anybody to file a grievance against submissions and that, as of Wednesday afternoon, no such grievance had been filed. Robak told the publication: “This is a broader conversation about how do we decide what art is and how do we judge it appropriately?”
- On Twitter, some responses to Allen’s win were more extreme. One user said, “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes,” while another bemoaned that artwork was now “slop produced as cheaply and quickly as possible to be consumed in bursts of a few microseconds as it glides by on the infinite feed.”
- “We’re watching the death of artistry unfold right before our eyes”
- The rise of text-to-AI image generators has only just begun, but already, the programs are sparking heated debates about the nature of art, whether this software poses a threat to artists’ livelihoods, and whether or not the companies that create these systems own anything to the artists whose work their programs are trained on.
- Allen discussed some of these topics in the Midjourney Discord, asking whether “perceived level of effort” was essential to understanding art’s value. “What if we looked at it from the other extreme,” he writes, “what if an artist made a wildly difficult and complicated series of restraints in order to create a piece, say, they made their art while hanging upside-down and being whipped while painting (this is extreme.) Should this artist’s work be evaluated differently than another artist that created the same piece ‘normally’?”
- Speaking to The Pueblo Chieftain, Allen suggests that some reactions to his win — and to AI-generated artwork more generally — may be motivated in part by fear. “Artists are scared,” he says. “They’re worried that they’re going to be replaced by the robot.”

- Somebody entered the Colorado State Fair’s fine art competition with an AI-generated painting — and won first prize, Vice reports, pissing off artists everywhere.
- The artwork, titled "Théâtre D'opéra Spatial," depicts a scifi-inspired scene of an opera performance. But Jason Allen, who submitted the artwork, used AI image generator Midjourney to create it.
- The incident goes to show just how far the technology has come, reigniting the thorny debate surrounding the definition of art and what makes an artist an artist.
- Understandably, human artists weren't too thrilled by the prospect of an AI-generated artwork winning a prize.
- "Yeah that's pretty fucking shitty," artist Genel Jumalon tweeted in response.
- "We’re watching the death of artistry unfold before our eyes," another user chimed in. "If creative jobs aren’t safe from machines, then even high-skilled jobs are in danger of becoming obsolete. What will we have then?"
- Allen, for his part, argued on Midjourney's Discord that these artists were "discrediting the human element," according to Vice. In fact, he described in a post before he was announced as the winner how he went through a painstaking "many weeks" long process to come up with a "special prompt" that would make the AI generate the image.
- The debate surrounding the use of AI image generators to replace the work of human artists has really caught fire, with The Atlantic's Charlie Warzel recently catching flack for using a Midjourney-generated art for a newsletter.
- "Technology is increasingly deployed to make gig jobs and to make billionaires richer, and so much of it doesn't seem to benefit the public good enough," cartoonist Matt Borrs told Warzel in response. "AI art is part of that."

- When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
- "This technology exists, and it's creating pieces that prove it can do this now."
- Jason Allen recently lit a fire under the art world. The Colorado-based artist used AI software to create art, submitted it to the State Fair fine arts competition, and took first prize. The event attracted widespread attention, with Allen's work being covered in outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post, and sparking a debate on social media that, needless to say, veered from the sophisticated to the unhinged.
- "Yes, it has been a crazy week with everything that is happening," says Allen, the man in the middle of this intersection of culture and technology. "There has been a lot of love from the community but also a lot of hate, I have been receiving some hate mail."
- The hate mail is the internet being the internet, but the more cogent anti-AI art argument is that it automates a large element of the creative process, and thus should not be directly compared to art produced through traditional methods. There is also the wider argument about these AI being trained on work done by humans, though I'm not going to wade into that particular ethical quagmire here.
- There are also, however, a lot of assumptions being made about what these A.I. tools can do, and what Allen's creative process was. An important element to his win is that Allen credited the work to Midjourney as well as himself, being upfront about the process, and so this instantly struck me as another in the long line of stunts artists have pulled to get eyeballs on their work. It is a recurring feature in art history that half the battle for any artist is getting noticed, and complaining that Allen used software to help do that feels somewhat like railing against the 'factory' practices of many modern artists like Damien Hirst. Perception isn't everything, but it sometimes can be.
- I asked Allen what he felt lay behind the backlash. "Part of the issue I believe is a portion of artists were in denial of the ability for A.I. to reach a power level that could emulate the same level of creative expression that a human could, let alone compete against them," writes the artist. "We have not seen A.I. do this on its own yet, however, I have demonstrated that the technology should be taken seriously by winning the Colorado State Fair fine art competition in the digital arts category. This technology exists, and it's creating pieces that prove it can do this now."
- 
- Allen thinks that the capabilities of A.I. image generation software is causing "a sort of existential crisis right now" in the art community, referencing the disruptive technology of OpenAI as well as DALLE-2 and Midjourney (the software he used).
- "Denial is the first step in the grieving process, perhaps (and I am deliberately saying PERHAPS) artists should go through the healing process to reach their acceptance of A.I.," writes Allen. "Because it is not going away and is only going to become more powerful. I think the backlash is par for the course for any major advancement in technology as it pertains to art. Such was the case with the camera, threatening portrait artists in the past, where the guy 'didn't have to do anything except press a button.' Of course, we know that is ridiculous now, but it takes time to accept new eras of art advances."
- The method is of particular interest, because there's definitely a perception that this is an 'easy' way to create art, and you won't have to look far to find people who consider it cheating. I asked Allen if he could say how big the human element was in his work, and estimate how much time it took him to produce it.
- "I made over 900 iterations of Space Opera Theatre and put in 80+ hours conservatively," says Allen. "I chose my top three, cleaned them up in photoshop, and upscaled them with Gigapixel A.I. I am a creative writer and an art director and I think my work is obviously reflected in the prompt that I created to make these pieces."
- I mentioned both Duchamp and Jackson Pollock to Allen, because it felt to me like the contemporary resistance those artists' techniques faced almost came from the same place as the objections to using A.I. in the creative process. "In the end," says Allen. "Pollock was the one with his art in the museums and those 'more qualified' or 'talented' artists at the time [were not]…"
- A spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Agriculture told the New York Times that, as Allen disclosed the use of Midjourney in his submission, it fell within the competition's rules. They added that the judges didn't know what Midjourney was at the time, but Allen's work would have won regardless.
- Allen believes awards shows will eventually end up creating an 'AI category', which does seem like a sane solution. Equally, he's ready to face up to those who criticise his work.
- "The ethics isn’t in the technology," Allen told the New York Times following his win. "It’s in the people. This isn’t going to stop. Art is dead, dude. It’s over. AI won. Humans lost.”

- Artificial intelligence is being used to design magazine covers and provide pictures for internet newsletters. What could possibly go wrong?
- It all started with the headline over an entry in Charlie Warzel’s Galaxy Brain newsletter in the Atlantic: “Where Does Alex Jones Go From Here?” This is an interesting question because Jones is an internet troll so extreme that he makes Donald Trump look like Spinoza. For many years, he has parlayed a radio talkshow and a website into a comfortable multimillion-dollar business peddling nonsense, conspiracy theories, falsehoods and weird merchandise to a huge tribe of adherents. And until 4 August he had got away with it. On that day, though, he lost an epic defamation case brought against him by parents of children who died in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre – a tragedy that he had consistently ridiculed as a staged hoax; a Texas jury decided that he should pay nearly $50m in damages for publishing this sadistic nonsense.
- Warzel’s newsletter consisted of an interview with someone who had worked for the Jones media empire in its heyday and, as such, was interesting. But what really caught my eye was the striking illustration that headed the piece. It showed a cartoonish image of a dishevelled Jones in some kind of cavern surrounded by papers, banknotes, prescriptions and other kinds of documents. Rather good, I thought, and then inspected the caption to see who the artist was. The answer: “AI art by Midjourney”.
- Ah! Midjourney is a research lab and also the name of its program that creates images from textual descriptions using a machine-learning system similar to OpenAI’s Dall-E system. So someone on the Atlantic had simply typed “Alex Jones inside an American office under fluorescent lights” into a text box and – bingo! – the illustration that had caught my attention was one of the images it had generated.
- It turns out that the Atlantic is not the only established publication in which the Midjourney tool’s work has appeared. The normally staid Economist, for example, deployed it recently to produce its 11 June cover. This is significant because it illustrates how rapidly digital technologies can make the transition from leading edge to commodification. And as they do so, new fears and hopes rapidly emerge.
- Dall-E (the name is a geeky combination of the Pixar character Wall-E and Salvador Dalí) was derived from OpenAI’s pioneering GPT language models, which can generate vaguely plausible English text. Dall-E basically swaps pixels for text and was trained on 400m pairs of images with text captions that were “scraped” from the internet. (The carbon footprint of the computation involved in this process is unconscionable, but that’s for another day.)
- When GPT-3 appeared, it sparked a new instalment of the “augmentation v replacement” debate. Was the technology just the thin edge of a sinister wedge? GPT-3 could be used to “write” boring but useful text – stock market reports, say - but it could also generate noxious and apparently credible disinformation that would slip through the moderation systems of social media platforms. It could be used to augment the capacities of busy and overworked journalists or to dispense with them entirely. And so on.
- In the event, though, some of the steam has gone out of the GPT-3 controversy (though not out of the question of the environmental costs of such extravagant computing). However much sceptics and critics might ridicule human hacks, the crooked timber of humanity will continue to outwit mere machines for the foreseeable future. Journalism schools can relax.
- Dall-E might turn out to be a less straightforward case, though. As with GPT-3, its appearance generated intense interest, perhaps because while most people can write text, many of us cannot draw to save our lives. So having a tool that could enable us to overcome this disability would be quite a boon. You could, say, ask for a portrait of Shrek in the style of the Mona Lisa or Jane Austen as an astronaut and again it would do its best. So one can view it as a welcome augmentation of human capability.
- But there is also the “replacement” question. It turns out that it was Warzel himself who had used Midjourney’s bot to create an illustration rather than getting one from a copyrighted image bank or commissioning an artist to create an image. Big mistake: an artist spotted the caption and tweeted their shock that a national magazine such as the Atlantic was using a computer program to illustrate stories instead of paying an artist to do that work, thereby giving other publications the idea of doing the same. Before you could say “AI”, Warzel found himself playing the villain in a viral tweetstorm. Which was painful for him, but maybe also a salutary warning that publishers who give work to machines rather than creative artists deserve everything they get.

- It’s August 2022, and by now you’ve no doubt read (or more likely seen) something about AI art. Whether it’s random jokes made for Twitter or paintings that look like they were made by actual human beings, artificial intelligence’s ability to create art has exploded onto the scene over the last few months, and while this has been great news for shitposts and fans of tech, it has also raised a number of important questions and concerns.
- If you haven’t read or seen anything about the subject, AI art—at least as it exists in the state we know it today—is, as Ahmed Elgammal writing in American Scientist so neatly puts it, made when “artists write algorithms not to follow a set of rules, but to ‘learn’ a specific aesthetic by analyzing thousands of images. The algorithm then tries to generate new images in adherence to the aesthetics it has learned.”
- Currently there are a handful of prominent platforms that people are using, with three of the most popular being Midjourney, Dall-E and Stable Diffusion. None responded to requests for comment for this feature.
- From a user’s perspective, this is most often done by entering a text prompt, so you can type something like “wizard standing on a hillside under a rainbow”, and an AI will attempt to give you a fairly decent approximation of that in image form. You could also type “Spongebob grieving for Batman’s parents” and you’ll get something just as close to what you’re thinking.
- Basically, we now live in a world where machines have been fed millions upon millions of pieces of human endeavour, and are now using the cumulative data they’ve amassed to create their own works. This has been fun for casual users and interesting for tech enthusiasts, sure, but it has also created an ethical and copyright black hole, where everyone from artists to lawyers to engineers has very strong opinions on what this all means, for their jobs and for the nature of art itself.
- Given my interests here, I’ve spoken with a number of professional artists for this piece, all of them working in video games, films, and television, and many are concerned for the future of art jobs in the entertainment business. “Artists skills were already undervalued before this technology; I fear this will compound that even more”, Jeanette (not their actual name), a concept artist who has worked at several major AAA publishers, tells me.
- Bruce (again, not their real name), an artist who has worked on a bunch of award-winning indie hits, says “The endgame of a potential employer is not to make my job easier, it’s to replace me, or to reduce all my years spent honing my craft into a boring-ass machine learning pilot, where I’m trained to vaguely direct an equivalent software in hundreds of different directions until by chance it spits out an asset we could feasibly use in a game”.
- “I can’t think of many worse hells to wind up in for my career. Experientially and morally.”
- “I don’t think this tech will hurt any established, ‘big deal’ concept artists and illustrators as much as the low level ones”, says RJ Palmer, who has worked for Ubisoft and also on the film Detective Pikachu. “I could easily envision a scenario where using AI a single artist or art director could take the place of 5-10 entry level artists. The tech  is fairly basic (but still impressive) right now but it’s advancing so fast. The unfortunate reality of this industry is that speed is favoured over quality so often that a cleaned up, ‘good enough’ AI-generated image could suffice for a lot of needs.”
- “I have seen a lot of self-published authors and such say how great it will be that they don’t have to hire an artist”, Palmer says. “Doing that kind of work for small creators is how a lot of us got our start as professional artists. So as an artist seeing this attitude grow gives me concern for the next generation of artists being able to find consistent entry level work.”
- The worry over young, upcoming and part-time artists is one shared by Karla Ortiz, who has worked for Ubisoft, Marvel and HBO. “The technology is not quite there yet in terms of a finalized product”, she tells Kotaku. “No matter how good it looks initially, it still requires professionals to fix the errors the AI generates. It also seems to be legally murky territory, enough to scare many major companies.”
- “However, it does yield results that will be ‘good enough’ for some, especially those less careful companies who offer lower wages for creative work. Because the end result is ‘good enough’, I think we could see a lot of loss of entry level and less visible jobs. This would affect not just illustrators, but photographers, graphic designers, models, or pretty much any job that requires visuals. That could all potentially be outsourced to AI.”
- Travis Wright, a veteran entertainment industry artist, tells me “There’ll always be a need for someone who can give an art director exactly what they want, particularly character design, but with how quickly these algorithms have improved in just six months, it’s scary and I can totally see indie horror games, card games and Tabletop Role-Playing Games are going to benefit from using AI over paying an artist.”
- Websites like The Atlantic have already been spotted using AI-generated artwork at the top of articles, a space normally reserved for photos (taken by humans and paid for) or artwork (made by humans and paid for). Waypoint have also covered a (terrible) video game made using AI-generated assets.
- Jon Juárez, an artist who has worked with Square Enix and Microsoft, agrees that some companies and clients will only be too happy to make use of AI art. “Many authors see this as a great advantage, because this harvesting process offers the possibility of manipulating falsely copyright-free solutions immediately, otherwise they would take days to arrive at the same place, or simply would never arrive”, he says . “If a large company sees an image or an idea that can be useful to them, they just have to enter it into the system and obtain mimetic results in seconds, they will not need to pay the artist for that image. These platforms are washing machines of intellectual property.”
- “Intellectual property will no longer have value for small authors, because you will not be able to make a Star Wars movie, but Disney will be able to use your work for their movie. If AI ends up being an Aleph of narratives, the Aleph is going to be privatized and shielded by patents.”
- Which brings us to our next point of contention. Calling them a “washing machine of intellectual property” is definitely one way of putting the legal concerns surrounding these art generators. Simply put, as we often see with technology that has advanced faster than the law can keep up, there is no definitive, binding stance on the copyright issues at the heart of machines chewing up human art then spitting out artificial compilations of what they’ve learned.
- In February, the US Copyright Office “refused to grant a copyright” for a piece of art made by AI, saying that “human authorship is a prerequisite to copyright protection”. That case is now being appealed to a federal court, however, because the AI’s creator thinks that, having programmed the machine, he should be able to claim copyright over the works it produces. Even when a decision is ultimately reached in this case, it will take a lot more time and cases for a firmer legal consensus to form around the subject.
- But what is that work the AI’s creator is claiming, if not simply a casserole made from art created by actual human artists, who are not being paid or even credited for their contributions? Juárez says one of the major platforms “has used one of my images, subject to copyright, without my consent. It’s already inside the system, the program can use it to mimic my style and the damage is irreparable”.
- “In many of the results there have been traces of watermarks and signatures, these programs are explicitly designed with the function of removing such marks that can circumvent intellectual property”, Juárez adds. He’s referencing examples of AI-generated artworks appearing to have signatures in their  corners, suggesting that while drawing from pieces they have been fed, they’ve either tried to erase or copy the signature—albeit imperfectly—as well.
- Not everyone I spoke with is as downbeat on the copyright implications of these machines, however. Frank (not their real name), an artist who has worked on several blockbuster AAA console titles, tells me “People steal our art all the time. I don’t know how many client meetings I’ve been in where they show me some artist-I-know’s work and say ‘Make it like that’”.
- “It’s the highly unfortunate result of doing what we do. When you do it on a high level, people try to find ways to rip it off and duplicate it. AI is just another way that’s going to inevitably happen. I do question the ethics of it for sure, but currently it does a piss-poor job of actually pulling off what I do, and shit, if it does figure it out that’s going to save me so much time [laughs]. Go ahead AI, learn how to paint like me really well so I can just adjust it a bit and turn that in and then go take a nap because the world stinks and every day is hell.”
- Floris Didden, art director at Karakter, an Emmy-award winning studio (Game of Thrones), tells me something similar. “The nature of art-generating AIs doesn’t bother me as much as it seems to bother many artists”, he says. “We all look at each other’s work for inspiration on style, execution, ideas, subjects, etc., and mixing it with our own ideas in some way to hopefully create something that can stand on its own. To my mind the programmer is doing the same thing through the use of the AI they created. I’m not saying there’s no originality but let’s not pretend we don’t massively feed off each other.”
- “I don’t think legally speaking your copyright was violated when your art was fed into an AI, but I do think morally they owe you something. If you train an AI to perfectly match a specific artist’s style, I think that obviously violates the artist’s rights somehow, if not their copyright. I just don’t know how to legally enforce that.”
- Not everything about AI art is an ethical and copyright battleground, though. For all the discord surrounding their creation (and creations), the machines spitting these images out are themselves mere tools, and in the right hands, tools can be useful.
- “There are tremendous benefits to the tech for artists as well, which is part of why it’s such a headache”, Palmer says. “In the same way that a non-artist can now create an image, an artist can too which can be fine-tuned and enhanced through their sensibilities and training. I have had access to Dall-e 2 and it’s fun to see how far you can push it into creating things that don’t have a great 1:1 representation in real life (though it is currently not very good at this). Having it come up with loose compositions, color patterns, lighting, etc can all be very cool for getting inspiration.”
- Ortiz is equally enthused—and conflicted—by the practical possibilities for artists. “For me personally, I could see myself utilizing AI generated imagery for initial visual references and inspiration”, she says. “What if I wish to paint an object in a particular light scheme, or require a specific texture in a specific shape? AI would be an invaluable tool to assist me in my artworks! For some artists, AI would be an absolute game-changer, allowing them to have nearly immediate references to further inspire and potentially inform.”
- Didden is another who sees AI art as having a practical benefit. “I’m a concept artist and art director and fundamentally I think design is about solving problems, and more specifically the problems of other humans”, he says. “To do this you need to understand the constraints of the project, have ways of generating solutions, and be able to recognize when you hit on the right one. I always thought that as a concept artist you basically just needed problem-solving skills, some way to visualize your solution, and a dose of good taste (whatever that is). So for a designer, I think AI-generated art is going to be just another tool to use.”
- Beyond the immediate concerns and potential uses for working artists, there are larger forces at play, and questions—sorry to bring this up on a video game website considering how tiring our scene’s own conversations can be—about the nature of art, and work, and working in art. What does it say about us as a point in human history if we have people working toward, and championing, the use of artificial intelligence to create art? As though it was something that needed to be industrialised, the latest front in a seemingly never-ending struggle between workers and machines?
- The reason for this is of course because there are, as there always are in these times, financial considerations at the heart of this movement, some of which are mixing in the same circles as so many other dystopian technological creations—which care only about the tech itself and its possible uses than any ethical, environmental or industrial concerns—like cryptocurrency and NFTs. OpenAI, the lab behind Dall-E, was co-founded by Elon Musk, and already there have been million-dollar sales of NFT artworks generated by artificial intelligence. And that’s just the start.
- “Stable Diffusion is planning to make profit out of ‘private’ models for customers, profiting from creating general infrastructure layer, and currently some of their lead developers are utilizing AI generated imagery for sale”, Ortiz says. “Both DALL-E and Midjourney have subscription models as well.”
- “Some of these companies’ current and potential profits are directly linked, via obscure data sets, to hundreds and thousands of copyrighted creative works from all kinds of creative professionals”, she adds. “That alone is chilling, but to also have no way to opt out of these tools–especially once your work has been used to train an AI–concerns me as an artist very much. I know the coming legal battles will change the landscape. All I can hope for is that the law will move quickly to protect our creative livelihoods, while simultaneously allowing for these new technologies to grow in a way that is beneficial to us all, not just a handful of companies and developers.”
- Most ludicrously, there now exists a marketplace called PromptBase, designed solely to sell “prompts”, which are the inputs used to actually generate AI images. Surprising nobody, this marketplace is already rife with copyrighted works, ranging from pop culture characters to branded sneakers.
- At the heart of this entire conundrum looms the false equivalency of even calling what an AI generates “art”. Art is inherently human. Its ability to draw upon and inspire our emotions is perhaps the most defining thing  that separates us from other animals. (Sorry, opposable thumbs.) It is defined specifically as “a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas”.
- A machine is not creating art. A machine, even ones as advanced as the AI we’re talking about here, is crunching data. There is no perspective to AI art, no inspiration, nothing it is trying to communicate. It’s a compilation playlist built by an algorithm, spinning an endless number of remixes and cover songs. The fact so many people are getting bogged down comparing AI art to the creations of human beings, as though the former is doing anything but adhering to an algorithm, is playing right into the hands of those championing this mimicry, because it sets AI creations on a level playing field that they don’t deserve.
- Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag perhaps summed it up better than anyone when he said last week “What I don’t like about AI tech is not that it can produce brand new 70s rock hits like ‘Keep On Glowing, You Mad Jewel’ by Fink Ployd, but how it reveals that that kind of derivative, generated goo is what our new tech lords are hoping to feed us in their vision of the future”.
- “I think AI art, just like NFTs, is a technology that just amplifies all the shit I hate with being an artist in this feudal capitalist dystopia, where every promising new tool always ends up in the hands of the least imaginative and most exploitative and unscrupulous people.”

- The rise of high-quality image generators powered by AI promises to open up exciting new possibilities, but the prospect of their widespread adoption is causing disquiet among many creatives
- It wasn’t meant to happen like this. Yes, the robots were always going to come for everyone’s jobs, but it was the menial ones that were set to go first. Freed from the need to fill out spreadsheets and perform administrative duties, we were all supposed to have extra time to indulge in more creative, fulfilling pursuits. Yet Microsoft Excel still exists while AI algorithms are producing works of art that are both commercially ­viable and critically respected.
- An AI artist, Jason Allen, recently caused outrage among old-school digital artists by winning a digital art competition. One of the writers of US publication The Atlantic, Charlie Warzel, provoked the ire of illustrators around the world by choosing to adorn an article about controversial radio host Alex Jones with an AI-generated caricature as opposed to using a stock photo or commissioning a portrait.
- Three new products – OpenAI’s Dall-E 2, Midjourney and the truly open-source Stable Diffusion – have transformed the way we see creati­vity since their launches this year. Given a simple text prompt, they can create remarkably accurate visuals in an infinite number of styles. From superimposing Kermit the Frog on to some of cinema’s best-known ­images to imagining an ­expanded version of Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring, they are ­astounding visual playgrounds.
- Nando Costa, director of Google’s design outreach team, is optimistic about the creative opportunities being opened up by these new ­technologies. He argues that tools such as Dall-E 2 and Midjourney will “change the way we do everything across creative production”.
- But it’s unclear whether anyone truly grasps the significance of these advances at such an early stage. Discussing AI art on their podcast, My First Million, internet entrepreneurs Sam Parr and Shaan Puri compared the arrival of these technologies to passing a purple unicorn on the road and not stopping to make sense of what you have seen. ”Dream” or “generation” engines, as they called the likes of Dall-E 2, are indeed something we can recognise as special without necessarily being able to understand their implications.
- If the output is good enough for both expert eyes and the mainstream media, their application for commercial purposes should be straightforward, right?
- For some design, brand and PR agencies, the potential is clear. “This is the future of creativity,” ­argues Melanie Commey, creative ­director at Bound to Prosper. “It gives non-designers a new opportunity to create and blend concepts, offering the capacity to generate ­imagery in multiple styles.”
- Could this effectively reduce time spent on design or reduce the manpower needed? “This is dependent on how the technology is integrated in agencies over time,” Commey says. “But it definitely has the abi­lity to change the nature of creative work as we move to a more virtually focused realm.”
- For other players in the space, AI can serve as a well of inspiration – at least, that’s how Diagram is ­attempting to use it. The firm’s AI-based systems aid automation via ­design tools such as Figma.
- For freelance illustrators, it might mean industrial-scale redundancy in real time
- “AI augments and enhances human creativity,” says Diagram’s founder and CEO, Jordan Singer. “Our AI will extend designers’ existing creativity and embed itself in their workflows to allow them to work faster and iterate on ideas in tandem with the team.”
- After all, the impressive outputs from these AI art generators are possible only because human artists and photographers originally perfected each of the styles and subjects depicted. In that sense, these image-generation toolkits are useful sieves, enabling us to ­explore recombined versions of what we’ve already seen. They can become an aid, just as libraries and Wikipedia help writers with their research. But these technologies are clearly not without controversy.
- “Every tool is permitted and AI is happening one way or another,” observes David O’Reilly, an award-­winning artist and ­animator. “But this species derives its entire value from the creative work of uncredited and unwilling participants.”
- AI algorithms are trained on images and accompanying texts from across the internet. For many people, this root data belongs to our shared human heritage. And a lot of it would originally be the work of individual artists. Yet, when you use Midjourney or Stable Diffusion to illustrate an article, there is no credit awarded to the creatives who originally fuelled the training data. This makes many artists, even those working in the digital sphere, wary. There’s a difference between having your job taken away by a ­machine that’s simply better at making art and being usurped by one that uses material stolen from you and countless other artists.
- The speed and relatively low cost of generating high-quality outputs is the most immediately troubling aspect for illustrators and other creatives. For editors and marketers, it’s a cheap option for bespoke content. For freelance illustrators, it might mean industrial-scale redundancy in real time.
- Nonetheless, the opportunities for streamlining design briefs, trying out new ideas and replacing dull stock imagery will make life distinctly easier for many in the profession. But it is unclear whe­ther the world of visual creativity will necessarily be richer for this new technology in the long term. After all, even the text prompts themselves can be automated.
- “The question is no longer whe­ther a computer can make art, but whether a human is needed at all,” O’Reilly says. “AI is likely to lead to unimaginably beautiful art and powerful affirmations of humanity, as well as widespread job disruption and the atrophying of fundamental human skills.”
- The question remains: will that outcome be worth it?

- A few lessons from my mistake
- Galaxy Brain helps you navigate the latest in tech, media, and big ideas. Sign up to get it in your inbox.
- Fair warning: What follows is navel-gazey. Last week, in a particular corner of the on-demand outrage service that is Twitter, I was, for a few hours, the dreaded Main Character. This was entirely my fault. And since I write a fair amount about viral backlash cycles and social-media dynamics, I figured it might be helpful to explore the whole thing from my vantage point.
- Last week’s newsletter was a long interview with a defector from Infowars who’s very critical of Alex Jones. Instead of selecting a photo or illustration from Getty Images to go with the story, as I do for most of my newsletters, I decided to try something different and use an AI art tool to come up with the story’s accompanying image. Using Midjourney’s Discord interface, I submitted the prompt “Alex Jones inside an American Office under fluorescent lights.” In a few minutes it spit out a distorted but still-recognizable rendering of Jones in a grim office setting, surrounded by paper. Jones looked miserable, and given that the interview was about how he manages to inflict misery on countless people daily, I thought it worked well as an illustration for the story. I also asked the AI tool to imagine “Alex Jones trying to fix a paper jam.” The result struck me as darkly funny, and not at all generous to Jones, so I included it in the piece.
- A day later, an artist–slash–art director saw the post and noticed that I credited “AI art by Midjourney” in the captions. In a series of tweets, they wrote that they were frustrated and a little shocked that a national magazine like The Atlantic was using a computer program to illustrate stories instead of paying an artist to do that work. They were also concerned about this particular use case potentially giving other publications an excuse, or at least an idea, to cut corners on an art budget. The tweets made some assumptions about my intent, and the magazine’s, but they were by no means abusive or rude. The second I saw the tweets in my feed, I immediately understood where the person was coming from. So I reached out to clarify:
- i promoted this myself. the avenue i have to illustrate my newsletter is a getty account and i was momentarily tired of using the same image of Jones. i was playing around w/ midjourney as i’ve seen other newsletter writers do & decided to try this. i don’t think i will again.
- But I was too late. In the time between my tweet of clarification and the time the tweeter saw it, their original complaint-tweet had already gotten picked up by others, who quote-tweeted it mostly to express the view that my editorial decision was “fucked up.” The screenshot of my article with The Atlantic’s logo and the AI art seemed, to many, to tell a definitive story.
- Once the original tweeter saw my explanation, they realized that they had made a few incorrect assumptions about my choice to use AI art. [Inside-baseball alert: As my pieces are primarily email posts with a web component, they’re a part of a different editorial workflow and do not go through the magazine’s art department. Instead, it is my job to illustrate the post using a Getty Images account provided to me by the magazine.] TL;DR: The Jones post was never a candidate for a commissioned illustration. The original tweeter very graciously apologized for their misunderstanding and deleted their tweet, and I apologized for being obtuse and not realizing the implications of my decision to use that illustration with zero clarification. It was, all in all, a good, productive internet exchange. Or so I thought.
- We all knew AI art would be used in this way eventually but to actually see it happen is really nasty. pic.twitter.com/qInIGZTUlU
- I closed my phone for a few hours and reopened it to a direct message that said, “I’m really sorry this is happening to you.” Never a great sign! I opened Twitter to see that the initial screenshot of my newsletter was now getting shared at an even higher volume than before. Another (understandably frustrated) person had seen the first tweet and wanted to vent as well. By the time I saw it, the new tweet had about 8,000 likes and a hundred or so quote tweets, most of them quite angry at myself or the magazine. My open DMs were well stocked with people alternately calling me a piece of shit or asking why everyone on Twitter was calling me a piece of shit. I’m not looking for sympathy here. This is a pretty common consequence of writing or creating anything online when you have a social-media account over a certain number of followers (usually about 10,000 is where people tend to note a change in how audiences treat them) and, in this was in no way even remotely equivalent to the harassment that many people endure daily just for doing their jobs. Moreover, I very much understand why people were mad.
- I even wrote about some of the thorny problems surrounding AI art in a newsletter shortly before my Jones mishap, including the following quote about an AI art generator: “DALL-E is trained on the creative work of countless artists, and so there’s a legitimate argument to be made that it is essentially laundering human creativity in some way for commercial product.” And yet, I still somehow managed to miss the implications as they related to my very own work. Not great, Charlie!
- Since then, I’ve reached out to a few of the artists offering criticisms on Twitter to try to get a deeper, good-faith understanding of the threat of AI art, as they saw it, as well as to understand a bit more about what they felt when they saw the screenshot of my piece and why they chose to engage online. None of them got back to me, but I did have a conversation with Matt Bors, the cartoonist, writer, editor, and founder of the excellent publication The Nib. Bors has some concerns with AI art tools like Midjourney and DALL-E and echoed some of the frustrations I’d heard on Twitter.
- “Technology is increasingly deployed to make gig jobs and to make billionaires richer, and so much of it doesn't seem to benefit the public good enough,” he told me. “AI art is part of that. To developers and technically minded people, it’s this cool thing, but to illustrators it’s very upsetting because it feels like you’ve eliminated the need to hire the illustrator.”
- Bors argues that what seems most alarming (and this was borne out in a lot of the tweets I saw as well) is the speed at which the technology is improving. “It has its own style right now and there are flaws, but it is only going to get better,” he said. And, set in the broader context of smaller art departments and budgets, the emergence of on-demand drawings feels like a punch in the face.
- “It’s not like there’s a ton of illustration happening online,” Bors continued. “Go to a website and most of the image content is hosted elsewhere. Articles are full of embedded tweets or Instagram posts or stock photography. The bottom came out of illustration a while ago, but AI art does seem like a thing that will devalue art in the long run.”
- I told Bors that what I felt worst about was how mindless my decision to use Midjourney ultimately had been. I was caught up in my own work and life responsibilities and trying to get my newsletter published in a timely fashion. I went to Getty and saw the same handful of photos of Alex Jones, a man who I know enjoys when his photo is plastered everywhere. I didn’t want to use the same photos again, nor did I want to use his exact likeness at all. I also, selfishly, wanted the piece to look different from the 30 pieces that had been published that day about Alex Jones and the Sandy Hook defamation trial. All of that subconsciously overrode all the complicated ethical issues around AI art that I was well apprised of.
- What worries me about my scenario is that Midjourney was so easy to use, so readily accessible, and it solved a problem (abstracting Jones' image in a visually appealing way), that I didn’t have much time or incentive to pause and think it through. I can easily see others falling into this like I did.
- For these reasons, I don’t think I’ll be using Midjourney or any similar tool to illustrate my newsletter going forward (an exception would be if I were writing about the technology at a later date and wanted to show examples). Even though the job wouldn’t go to a different, deserving, human artist, I think the optics are shitty, and I do worry about having any role in helping to set any kind of precedent in this direction. Like others, I also have questions about the corpus used to train these art tools and the possibility that they are using a great deal of art from both big-name and lesser-known artists without any compensation or disclosure to those artists. (I reached out to Midjourney to ask some clarifying questions as to how they choose the corpus of data to train the tool, and they didn’t respond.)
- Now, because this tiny ordeal revolved around a lot of tweets, I feel compelled to point out some things I noticed over the last few days (besides the fact that I very much should have seen this coming and was tweeting in a prison of my own design):
- Some main-character situations seem to arise from people having a blend of bad information and wrong assumptions, but also legitimate grievances.
- Often, the less information we have about something online, the easier it is to be angry about it. I found it surprisingly dispiriting to watch so many people be very, publicly upset about a situation that they had incomplete information about. The initial assumption that The Atlantic was now going all-in on AI art illustrations would have been newsworthy. And it would have been genuinely upsetting if, as some wrongly assumed, the decision to do so was because some corporate overlords were interested in stripping the editorial operation down to the studs to shave costs. The reason behind their anger was very legitimate, but it was really frustrating to watch so much energy being expended toward a problem that, at present, wasn’t exactly real.
- It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to correct a wrong assumption after it has achieved critical mass without amplifying the initial wrong assumption.
- I knew this going in, and yet I still felt compelled to address some of the loudest tweets with an explanation (and acknowledgment of the problem). All this did was make the initial tweets more visible, which ultimately poured more gas on the fire. This is a reasonably common experience among anyone who has been pulled into some version of the discourse tornado—any attempt to try to correct some incorrect information only amplifies the incorrect information. This dynamic exists elsewhere (sometimes fact-checking or debunking also boosts the signal of false claims), but it is an extremely efficient experience on Twitter. Honestly, I think this is the truest example of Twitter as a system that isn’t just broken, but broken in a way that feels almost sinister.
- It wasn’t the initial critical tweet that landed me in main-character purgatory, but the tweets that splintered out from it.
- I can only speak from my own experience, but I thought it was interesting how the initial critical tweet about the newsletter post was earnest and thoughtful and quite civil. Then Twitter’s dynamics played a game of telephone with the tweet, abstracting it and pulling it further away from any additional context that I (and the initial tweeter) inserted into the discussion. It was fascinating to watch the context collapse get stronger as the screenshot was quote-tweeted further and further away, even onto different social platforms. As it got passed along, I found the comments got progressively nastier until, eventually, the screenshot got to a Twitter user with no profile picture and no followers telling me I deserved to die in a mass shooting. The internet!
- The correction to a wrong tweet never gets even a fraction of shares as the wrong tweet.
- This isn’t news. But I suppose it’s good to know the dynamic still holds extremely true.
- A subject like AI art is a decent subject to quickly get people mad.
- A good formula for something that can generate a lot of outrage is one where the stakes are high (as they are for artists in this example) and where the subject is something that is very easy to understand at a basic level and much more complex at the semantic level. AI art tools, as I wrote a few weeks ago, are pretty easy to grasp in broad strokes. But technically, their diffusion model is more complicated. This subject-area dynamic is usually fertile ground for people to get angry or conspiratorial.
- For example, a lot of people were really concerned that, simply by plugging prompts into Midjourney, I was giving it intelligence and making it smarter. But I’ve also had numerous people tell me that that’s not the way these tools work and that the models have to be updated internally in order to learn. Similarly, people make the mistake of assuming that the AI tool is more intelligent or cunning than it really is (there’s good evidence to suggest it really struggles with the relationships between objects).
- I’m slightly confused about a lot of this myself. But that’s the point. Areas where the subject matter is confusing or opaque invite more frustration and conflict. This is why companies like Open AI or Midjourney ought to give artists more easily accessible and plainspoken information about their tools and what they’re trained on in order to bridge the gulf.
- I am a doofus.
- At the heart of all of this is me not thinking things through. And so I’ve commissioned Matt Bors to illustrate me, a doofus, getting yelled at by people online. His excellent work will run as the art in a subsequent newsletter.

- Ammaar Reshi was playing around with ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot from OpenAI when he started thinking about the ways artificial intelligence could be used to make a simple children’s book to give to his friends. Just a couple of days later, he published a 12-page picture book, printed it, and started selling it on Amazon without ever picking up a pen and paper.
- The feat, which Reshi publicized in a viral Twitter thread, is a testament to the incredible advances in AI-powered tools like ChatGPT—which took the internet by storm two weeks ago with its uncanny ability to mimic human thought and writing. But the book, Alice and Sparkle, also renewed a fierce debate about the ethics of AI-generated art. Many argued that the technology preys on artists and other creatives—using their hard work as source material, while raising the specter of replacing them.
- 
- Reshi, a product design manager from the San Francisco Bay Area, gathered illustrations from Midjourney, a text-to-image AI tool that launched this summer, and took story elements from a conversation he had with the AI-powered ChatGPT about a young girl named Alice. “Anyone can use these tools,” Reshi tells TIME. “It’s easily and readily accessible, and it’s not hard to use either.”
- His experiment creating an AI-generated book in just one weekend shows that artificial intelligence might be able to accomplish tasks faster and more efficiently than any human person can—sort of. The book was far from perfect. The AI-generated illustrations had a number of issues: some fingers looked like claws, objects were floating, and the shadowing was off in some areas. Normally, illustrations in children’s books go through several rounds of revisions—but that’s not always possible with AI-generated artwork on Midjourney, where users type a series of words and the bot spits back an image seconds later.
- Alice and Sparkle follows a young girl who builds her own artificial intelligence robot that becomes self aware and capable of making its own decisions. Reshi has sold about 70 copies through Amazon since Dec. 4, earning royalties of less than $200. He plans to donate additional copies to his local library.
- Reshi’s quixotic project drew praise from many users for its ingenuity. But many artists also strongly criticized both his process and the product. To his critics, the speed and ease with which Reshi created Alice and Sparkle exemplifies the ethical concerns of AI-generated art. Artificial intelligence systems like Midjourney are trained using datasets of millions of images that exist across the Internet, then teaching algorithms to recognize patterns in those images and generate new ones. That means any artist who uploads their work online could be feeding the algorithm without their consent. Many claim this amounts to a high-tech form of plagiarism that could seriously harm human artists in the near future.
- Reshi’s original tweet promoting his book received more than 6 million impressions and 1,300 replies, many of which came from book illustrators claiming artists should be paid or credited if their work is used by AI.
- “In order to protect the rights and property of artists, there must be stricter regulation around how art is used to train AI algorithms,” says Michelle Jing Chan, an illustrator of children’s books. “Artists should be appropriately compensated when their works are used in the training of algorithms.”
- “The main problem to me about AI is that it was trained off of artists’ work,” adds Adriane Tsai, also a children’s book illustrator. “It’s our creations, our distinct styles that we created, that we did not consent to being used.”
- 
- Already, some companies and brands are choosing AI technology over human talent. The San Francisco Ballet used images generated by Midjourney to promote this season’s production of the Nutcracker. A digitally-generated fashion model, Shudu Gram, has modeled for brands including Louis Vuitton. And at comedy clubs, artificial intelligence is being used to deliver standup jokes.
- The phenomena has made many creatives nervous about their own futures, wondering if people will pay for their services when they could generate it for much cheaper using AI.
- “As somebody who makes my money and finds my joy in writing, it’s deeply troubling to see people seeking cheap alternatives to actual human writing, which is already one of the most deliriously underpaid professions,” says Abraham Josephine Riesman, an author.
- 
- Reshi responded to these concerns by calling on the creators of the AI tools at OpenAI and Midjourney to ensure protections for artists and authors whose work may be used in artificial intelligence algorithms.
- “I think there’s real concern and I actually do hear out those artists,” Reshi says. “It’s really important that the tech industry that’s working on these tools involves them in the process of creation.”

- Ammaar Reshi told BuzzFeed News that he has received death threats and messages encouraging self-harm on social media.
- BuzzFeed Contributor
- Ammaar Reshi, 28, has been fascinated by technology since he was a child. “I was always curious, and my dad let me play with his computer when I was 5 years old,” he said. He grew up in Pakistan before his family moved to the UK, where Reshi studied computer science in London. A job at Palantir Technologies led Reshi to Palo Alto, California, and since 2020 he’s worked at fintech company Brex, where he’s now a design manager.
- When a raft of generative AI tools started to hit the market over the last few months, Reshi began tinkering with them. Earlier this month, he had the idea to make a book for his best friends’ kid, who was born this year, using AI. “I said I was going to take a weekend to try to put this out there,” he recalled.
- First, Reshi used ChatGPT to come up with a tale about Alice, a young girl who wants to learn about the world of tech, and Sparkle, a cutesy robot who helps her. “That gave me a base of a story,” Reshi said. “It was OK. It had its issues, of course. So then I started tweaking it.”
- He asked ChatGPT to make Alice a bit more curious and Sparkle more self-aware. Reshi then used the AI app Midjourney to create the images he wanted. “I just started putting prompts like ‘young girl’ and some descriptors: ‘blue eyes,’ ‘simple dress,’ ‘excited,’ ‘curious,’” he said. “That yielded some results. Now, let me tell you, some of those results were absolutely wack. It would have become a horror book if I put those early illustrations in.”He spent hours tweaking the prompts given to Midjourney, estimating that he rejected “hundreds” of illustrations in order to get the 13 that fill the 14-page book. “I almost gave up because I was like, I don't know if it's possible, but then I just pushed through at the end,” he said.
- Alice and Sparkle
- Reshi uploaded the results to Amazon’s Kindle Direct Publishing, which put Alice and Sparkle on Amazon on Dec. 4, just 72 hours after he had first come up with the idea. Initially, Reshi intended only on making the book for his friends’ child. But when he shared the news on Instagram that he’d created a book using AI, his wider circle of friends began asking if they could buy it. (So far, he said he’s sold more than 70 books and gifted about “40 to 45.”)Others encouraged him to share news of the release more widely. But when Reshi posted about the book on Twitter, people, including children’s book illustrators, criticized him for automating the process at the expense of human creativity.One critic is Anupa Roper, a children’s book author based in the UK, who said she had a “sinking feeling in the pit of [her] stomach,” when she saw Reshi’s tweet. “I’m thinking, Is it really that easy to create something that I had to pour my heart and soul into?" Roper said.Fellow UK children’s author Josie Dom refused to download Reshi’s book. “I don’t feel he deserves to earn any money from the book, because he has not actually put much work into it,” she said. However, based on reading the sample pages on Amazon, Dom said, she is “concerned that the use of AI in creating stories will create a proliferation of poor-quality stories, both on the writing and the illustration side.”
- Dom said that Alice and Sparkle has “quite a few anomalies” in the illustrations — some of which Reshi himself admitted to on social media.
- There were also some hilarious results 😂 what’s going on with those eyes and hands?!
- She’s also concerned with the fact that generative AI platforms are trained on other people’s work, an issue that many artists have previously highlighted as a concern. “Artists are often underpaid, and this won’t help them,” Dom said. “Their work is being stolen, basically.”
- The children’s author said the story was “formulaic” — a natural result of being produced by a computer program. “It’s also flat and boring,” Dom added. “All readers deserve rich, imaginative stories — with children’s stories, especially. They serve to entertain, as well as educate.” She said that Reshi’s book failed in those regards.
- Meanwhile, Corey Brickley, an illustrator who works on book covers, criticized Reshi’s AI-generated artwork with this tweet:
- just wanna save this for posterity in case i get blocked
- Brickley did not respond to a request to comment for this story.Reshi said that he didn’t anticipate the backlash. “The thing that upsets me the most is, I totally think it's very valid that these artists have real concern and have a passionate response and feel threatened,” he said. “I totally understand as an artist if you see this as an existential threat to your livelihood. This makes absolute sense.” (He added that a number of people have contacted him to say how impressed they were by the output of the AI models.)
- Reshi said that he has received death threats and messages encouraging self-harm. “If we can’t have discourse without being civil, then we’re not going to make progress,” he said. He added that the strength of the reaction had made him think more about the issues at hand. “It’ll make me do more homework, for sure,” he said. “I want to do the right thing. I want to help support the artists if I can.”Reshi said he now believes that platforms like OpenAI need to be transparent about what data their models are trained on. “I don’t know why we can’t say, ‘Here’s all the art that was ingested into making this,’” he said, “so that we can clarify if art is really being stolen or if they’re taking copyrighted material.” He said he believes that such platforms need to work with artists affected by the AI revolution.Overall, he’s seen the experience as a learning one — and a chastening one. “I am grateful that it’s publicized a very critical debate and discussion that’s to be had,” he said. “I’m honestly just saddened by how that debate has played out. The hateful rhetoric and the abuse is really not fun to read."As to whether there’ll be a second chapter in the story of Alice and Sparkle, Reshi is less certain. “I think I’m going to hold off on that until I learn more about how this art is being used and if there are ways to use it while also protecting artists,” he said. “I don’t just want to preach that — I want to practice it.”

- Confronted with an overwhelming amount of artificial-intelligence-generated artwork flooding in, some online art communities have taken dramatic steps to ban or curb its presence on their sites, including Newgrounds, Inkblot Art, and Fur Affinity, according to Andy Baio of Waxy.org.
- Baio, who has been following AI art ethics closely on his blog, first noticed the bans and reported about them on Friday. So far, major art communities DeviantArt and ArtStation have not made any AI-related policy changes, but some vocal artists on social media have complained about how much AI art they regularly see on those platforms as well.
- Me deiciding if i should press like on a painting on deviantart, not knowing whether its AI generated or not pic.twitter.com/fDsGnF2nfF
- The arrival of widely available image synthesis models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has provoked an intense online battle between artists who view AI-assisted artwork as a form of theft (more on that below) and artists who enthusiastically embrace the new creative tools.
- Established artist communities are at a tough crossroads because they fear non-AI artwork getting drowned out by an unlimited supply of AI-generated art, and yet the tools have also become notably popular among some of their members.
- In banning art created through image synthesis in its Art Portal, Newgrounds wrote, "We want to keep the focus on art made by people and not have the Art Portal flooded with computer-generated art."
- Fur Affinity cited concerns about the ethics of how image synthesis models learn from existing artwork, writing, "Our goal is to support artists and their content. We don’t believe it’s in our community’s best interests to allow AI generated content on the site."
- These are only the latest moves in a quickly evolving debate about how art communities (and art professionals) can adapt to software that can potentially produce unlimited works of beautiful art at a rate that no human working without the tools could match.
- The current wave of image synthesis tools allows users to type in a written description (called a "prompt") and output a matching image, almost like magic. The results often need cherry-picking and dedication to get just right, but with a skillfully crafted prompt, the results can imitate the works of human artists with sometimes stunning detail.
- The most successful prompts often reference existing artists and art websites by name but rarely alone. Mixing artists can create innovative new stylistic blends. For example, here is the prompt that created the robotic woman in the center of the image at the top of this article in Stable Diffusion:
- Beautiful crying! female mechanical android!, half portrait, intricate detailed environment, photorealistic!, intricate, elegant, highly detailed, digital painting, artstation, concept art, smooth, sharp focus, illustration, art by artgerm and greg rutkowski and alphonse mucha (Seed 79409656)
- The most popular image synthesis models use the latent diffusion technique to create novel artwork by analyzing millions of images without consent from artists or copyright holders. In the case of Stable Diffusion, those images come sourced directly from the Internet, courtesy of the LAION-5B database. (Images found on the Internet often come with descriptions attached, which is ideal for training AI models.)
- Recently, Baio and AI researcher Simon Willison grabbed data for more than 12 million images in LAION-5B and created a search tool that lets users peek into a small but representative slice of the much larger set. (You can also search the LAION5B image set for artwork—or even your own name—in a demo hosted on Github.)
- A few weeks ago, some artists began discovering their artwork in the Stable Diffusion data set, and they weren't happy about it. Charlie Warzel wrote a detailed report about these reactions for The Atlantic last week. With battle lines being drawn firmly in the sand and new AI creativity tools coming out steadily, this debate will likely continue for some time to come.

- Last month, ahead of its annual December production of The Nutcracker, the San Francisco Ballet posted an illustration of the show’s iconic protagonist to its Instagram account. But unlike Drosselmeyer’s familiar wooden soldier, human hands did not create this nutcracker.
- “This AI art looks like CRAP, I can’t believe you did this instead of hiring real artists,” one person commented on the image. “Shame on you.”
- The comment section is now filled with similar expressions of anger and accusations that the SF Ballet is stealing intellectual property and robbing living, breathing artists of the opportunity to earn money.
- The uproar over the promotional materials is yet another example of how AI-generated visuals are stirring controversy in the art world. While casual observers might not think twice about this depiction of the ballet’s titular character—or two additional computer-drawn images of the Mouse King and Clara posted to the SF Ballet’s Instagram account—many feel that using artificial intelligence to create illustrations like these is tantamount to theft and represents a disturbing shift toward machines taking work from artists.
- “I grew up watching SF Ballet but am so ashamed of you for using AI generated images for Nutcracker promo knowing full well it’s created from works stolen from artists,” another commenter wrote. “A despicable decision, especially for an arts org.”
- San Francisco Ballet spokesperson Kate McKinney confirmed the images were made with AI generator Midjourney and said the promotional images were an experimentation with new technology.
- “In the spirit of Bay Area ingenuity, we tried something new,” McKinney told The Standard.
- But Imogen Chayes, a Bay Area-based artist who’s worked for Marvel Studios on She-Hulk said that the promotional content SF Ballet put out using AI could have been an opportunity for another artist.
- “It’s tragic to me that a creative institution like the SF Ballet, a company that celebrates the traditional arts, would embrace a medium that’s extremely harmful to the art community,” Chayes told The Standard.
- Although plenty have hailed the advent of AI-illustration tools, their use continues to be contentious, and few positive reactions could be found in the comments section of the SF Ballet’s Instagram account.

- Midjourney is one of the leading drivers of the emerging technology of using artificial intelligence (AI) to create visual imagery from text prompts. The San Francisco-based startup recently made news as the engine behind the artwork that won an award in a Colorado state fair competition, and that’s unlikely to be the last complicated issue that AI art will face in the coming years.
- Midjourney differentiates from others in the space by emphasizing the painterly aesthetics in the images it produces. The platform is not trying to create photorealistic images that can be mistaken for photographs, and CEO David Holz says he is personally very uneasy with the uncanny quality of deepfakes and other work that simulates reality too closely. Instead, Holz says Midjourney is designed to unlock the creativity of ordinary people by giving them tools to make beautiful pictures just by describing them.
- David Holz, founder/CEO Midjourney
- But despite the humanist, consumer-oriented focus of the company, there are inevitable questions about implications for commercial art and professional artists. I interviewed Holz for a broader piece on the potential disruptions AI art is likely to cause in the production of imagery for entertainment, videogames and publishing. Here is a longer excerpt from our conversation where Holz provides more depth and context as he addresses those issues and expounds on his vision for the company, the industry and the technology. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
- Rob Salkowitz, Forbes Contributor: What’s your role and title?
- David Holz, Midjourney. I'm the founder and CEO. I usually just prefer being called the founder, though, because CEO sounds very businessy, and we're not very businessy. We're an applied research lab that makes products.
- What is Midjourney’s mission?
- We like to say we’re trying to expand the imaginative powers of the human species. The goal is to make humans more imaginative, not make imaginative machines, which I think is an important distinction.
- Can you give a brief history of the company to date?
- We started working on the imagination part of our company about a year and a half ago. There were some breakthroughs on diffusion models, people understanding clip, openAI, that sort of thing. Almost everyone involved in this is San Francisco and we all realized this is going to get serious, that it’s different from a lot of other stuff.
- What does Midjourney see as the benefit of this text-to-image technology for business and society?
- I’m definitely more concerned about society than business. We’re a consumer product, but maybe 30%-50% of our users right now are professionals. The majority are not. Artists on the platform tell us it allows them to be more creative and explorative in the beginning, coming up with a lot of ideas in a short amount of time.
- Right now, our professional users are using the platform for concepting. The hardest part of [a commercial art project] is often at the beginning, when the stakeholder doesn’t know what they want and has to see some ideas to react to. Midjourney can help people converge on the idea they want much more quickly, because iterating on those concepts is very laborious.
- Another advantage for artists is it gives people confidence in areas they’re not confident in. Most if not all artists feel like there’s some part of art they can’t do well. It might be colors, composition, backgrounds. We have a famous character designer using our product and people ask him why would you use an AI since you’re so good already. And he said, “well, I’m only good at the character part. This is helping me build out the rest of the world.”
- About how many people are using the product?
- Millions are using it. Our Discord is over two million. It’s the biggest active Discord server by far now.
- Does Midjourney’s license allow for commercial use of imagery generated by the platform?
- Yes. But if you’re working for a company bigger than a million dollars in annual revenue, we ask that you buy a corporate license.
- How was the dataset built?
- It’s just a big scrape of the Internet. We use the open data sets that are published and train across those. And I’d say that’s something that 100% of people do. We weren’t picky. The science is really evolving quickly in terms of how much data you really need, versus the quality of the model. It’s going to take a few years to really figure things out, and by that time, you may have models that you train with almost nothing. No one really knows what they can do.
- Did you seek consent from living artists or work still under copyright?
- No. There isn’t really a way to get a hundred million images and know where they’re coming from. It would be cool if images had metadata embedded in them about the copyright owner or something. But that's not a thing; there's not a registry. There’s no way to find a picture on the Internet, and then automatically trace it to an owner and then have any way of doing anything to authenticate it.
- Can artists opt out of being including in your data training model?
- We’re looking at that. The challenge now is finding out what the rules are, and how to figure out if a person is really the artist of a particular work or just putting their name on it. We haven’t encountered anyone who wants their name taken out of the data set that we could actually find in the data set.
- Can artists opt out of being named in prompts?
- Not right now. We’re looking at that. Again, we’d have to find a way to authenticate those requests, which can get complicated.
- What do you say to commercial artists concerned this will destroy their livelihood? At a certain point, why would an art director hire an illustrator to produce work like concept art, production design, backgrounds – those sorts of things – when they can just enter prompts and get useful output much more quickly and at much lower cost?
- It's a lot of work still. It’s not just like “make me a background.” It might be ten times less work, but it is way more work than than a manager is going to do.
- I think there's kind of two ways this could go. One way is to try to provide the same level of content that people consume at a lower price, right? And the other way to go about it is to build wildly better content at the prices that we're already willing to spend. I find that most people, if they’re already spending money, and you have the choice between wildly better content or cheaper content, actually choose wildly better content. The market has already established a price that people are willing to pay.
- I think that some people will try to cut artists out. They will try to make something similar at a lower cost, and I think they will fail in the market. I think the market will go towards higher quality, more creativity, and vastly more sophisticated, diverse and deep content. And the people who actually are able to use like the artists and use the tools to do that are the ones who are going to win.
- These technologies actually create a much deeper appreciation and literacy in the visual medium. You might actually have the demand, outstrip the ability to produce at that level, and then maybe you'll actually be raising the salaries of artists. It could be weird, but that's what's going to happen. The pace of that demand increase for both quality and diversity will lead to some wonderful and unexpected projects getting made.
- A generation of students graduated art schools, many of them heavily in debt, counting on relatively well-paid jobs in entertainment production, videogame production, commercial art and so on. How does the emergence of AI text-to-image platforms impact their future?
- I think some people will try to cut costs, and some people will try to expand ambitions. I think the people who expand ambitions will still be paying all those same salaries, and the people who try to cut costs, I think will fail.
- Ai is typically used at scale for stuff like call centers or checking bags at airports and the sort of the jobs that people don't really care to do. And the value proposition is that it frees people up to do more rewarding, more interesting kinds of jobs. But art jobs are rewarding and interesting. People work their entire lives and develop their skills to get these kind of jobs. Why would you point this technology at that at that level of the economy as a as kind of a business focus and priority for the stuff that you're doing?
- Personally, I’m not. My stuff is not made for professional artists. If they like to use it, then that is great. My stuff is made for like people who, like, there's this woman in Hong Kong, and she came to me, and she goes, “The one thing in Hong Kong that your parents never want you to be is an artist, and I’m a banker now. I'm living a good banker life. But with Midjourney now I'm actually starting to get a taste of this experience of being the person I actually wanted to be.” Or a guy at the truck stop who’s making his own baseball cards with wild Japanese styles, just for fun. It's made for those people, because, like most people, they don't ever get to do these things.
- It's important to emphasize that this is not about art. This is about imagination. Imagination is sometimes used for art but it's often not. Most of the images created on Midjourney aren’t being used professionally. They aren’t even being shared. They’re just being used for these other purposes, these very human needs.
- Nevertheless, the output of your product is imagery, which has commercial value in professional context in addition to all of those other properties. And this is very disruptive of that economy.
- I think it's like we're making a boat, and somebody can race with the boat, but it doesn't mean that the boat's about racing. If you use the boat to race then maybe like, yeah, sure. In that moment it is. But the human side really matters, and I think that we're not… We want to make pictures look pretty. Like how flowers try to be beautiful for the bees. It's the beauty of nature, not the beauty of art. There's no intention in the machine. And our intention has nothing to do with art. We want the world to be more imaginative and we would rather make beautiful things than ugly things.
- Do you believe that any government body has jurisdiction or authority to regulate this technology? And if so, do you think they should?
- I don’t know. Regulation is interesting. You have to balance the freedom to do something with the freedom to be protected. The technology itself isn’t the problem. It’s like water. Water can be dangerous, you can drown in it. But it’s also essential. We don’t want to ban water just to avoid the dangerous parts.
- Well, we do want to be sure our water is clean.
- Yes, that’s true.

- ArtStation is probably the most important website on the whole internet for professional artists, especially those working in entertainment fields like video games. Most of our Fine Art links, for example, point there. Which is why the site’s continued allowance of AI-generated imagery has become a point of contention with its users.
- UPDATE 9:00pm ET December 14: ArtStation has since published an FAQ on the matter that has made things even worse. Original story follows.
- The technology, which is rotten to its core, is of particular concern to a community who make a living creating art, and as such should also be a concern to the companies responsible for owning and hosting that community. But as of today, ArtStation has no policy directly restricting the hosting or display of AI-generated imagery on the site, which has led to repeated instances where images made by computers, and not humans, have floated to the top of ArtStation’s “Explore” section, its most popular means of showcasing the work of artists.
- That is, understandably, pissing a lot of people off. Indeed, over the last 24 hours so many artists have become so incensed by the site’s allowance of AI-generated imagery that they’ve begun spamming their portfolios. A protest sparked by illustrator Nicholas Kole and costume designer Imogen Chayes resulting in ArtStation’s front page looking like this at time of writing:
- It’s just the same image, originally created by Alexander Nanitchkov and saying “No To AI Generated Images,” pasted over and over again by hundreds of artists:
- These artists are right to be upset! The rapidly-encroaching practice of AI-generated imagery is going to trash all kinds of websites, but to allow it on a site specifically designed to showcase the work of talented human artists is an especially bad look.
- “ArtStation’s content guidelines do not prohibit the use of AI tools in the process of creating artwork that is shared with the community,” a spokesperson for Epic Games, the owners of ArtStation, tells Kotaku. “That said, ArtStation is a portfolio platform designed to elevate and celebrate originality powered by a community of artists. Users’ portfolios should only feature artwork that they create, and we encourage users to be transparent in the process. Our content guidelines are here.”
- While that’s an expected response given the prevalence of AI-generated imagery currently on the site, and the apparent lack of moderation involved in letting them stay up, Epic also say they “do not make any agreements with companies allowing them to scrape content on our website. If AI companies are doing this without permission and beyond purely academic use (where copyright fair use may apply), they may be infringing the rights of ArtStation creators.”
- Epic also say they are “in the process of giving ArtStation users more control over how their work is shared and labeled, and we will provide more details in the near future.”
- While that veiled legal threat is perhaps a sign that Epic aren’t quite as cool with the practice as it seems, and word that user controls are coming in the “near future” is promising to an extent, that doesn’t change the fact that ArtStation user’s portfolios have already been fed to these AIs, and that it won’t do anything in the short term to stop AI-generated images from encroaching on a website that’s supposed to be showcasing the best in human art.
- For now, the best way to detect AI-generated imagery and ignore it (or even better, to report it) is the same way it has been for the past few months: always ask to see the fingers.
