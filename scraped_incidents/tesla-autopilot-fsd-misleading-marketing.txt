- An enhanced version of its Autopilot driver assistance system, whose core functions are adaptive cruise control and automatic steering, Tesla's Full-self Driving (FSD) capability offers a suite of more advanced driver assistance features, including auto lane change, auto park, traffic light recognition, stop sign recognition, and summon.
- On its website, Tesla says Autopilot and Full Self-Driving 'are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment. While these features are designed to become more capable over time, the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.'
- In 2020, a Munich court ruled that Tesla use of the words 'Autopilot' and 'Full Self-Driving' constituted misleading marketing, since the cars still required a driver to operate. The appeal ruling was over-turned by the Higher Regional Court of Munich in October 2022, according to TeslaMag.
- In March 2021 it was reported that Tesla knew and admitted that its Full Self-Driving Capability is not capable of full self-driving. The emails between Tesla's legal team and California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) were revealed after a public records request from transparency advocacy organisation Plainsite.
- A few days after Plainsite published the Tesla/DMV legal communications, US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) head Robert Sumwalt warned its sister agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), that it's 'hands-off approach to oversight of AV testing poses a potential risk to motorists and other road users.'
- 'Tesla recently released a beta version of its Level 2 Autopilot system, described as having full self-driving capability. By releasing the system, Tesla is testing on public roads a highly automated AV technology but with limited oversight or reporting requirements,' Sumwalt argued.
- In May 2021, the LA Times reported that California's DMV has put Tesla 'under review' to determine whether it misleads customers by advertising its full self-driving capability option. The DMV is allowed to sanction car manufacturers that advertise a vehicle as autonomous when it is not.
- In complaints filed with the state Office of Administrative Hearings, the DMV argued that Tesla 'made or disseminated statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts' about how well its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) worked.
- In September 2021, Motherboard reported that Tesla FSD Beta testers were being forced to sign non-disclosure agreements that specifically prohibited them from speaking to the media or giving test rides to the media.
- A video taken by a FSD Beta tester showing a Tesla swerving to take an unexpected right turn across a crosswalk into the path of several pedestrians had gone viral, prompting Tesla to press Twitter to have it removed.
- As noted by The Verge, Tesla was using NDAs to manage public perceptions of its Full Self-Driving software at a time when the company was about to open up access to expand the beta testing to a much wider group of Tesla drivers.
- In October 2022, Reuters reported that Tesla had been placed under criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) over claims that the company's electric vehicles can drive themselves, with DoJ prosecutors examining whether Tesla misled consumers, investors and regulators by making unsupported claims about its driver assistance technology's capabilities.
- In addition to the DoJ investigation, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had opened a civil investigation into whether Tesla had been misleading investors about the safety of its Autopilot system, according to The Wall Street Journal (WSJ).
- In January 2023, a legal deposition made by Tesla director of Autopilot software Ashok Elluswamy that was taken as part of a lawsuit over a driver's 2018 death in a Tesla said a demonstration video was staged to show capabilities like stopping at a red light and accelerating at a green light that the system did not have.
- The video was released in October 2016 and was promoted on Twitter by Elon Musk as evidence that 'Tesla drives itself.' The video remains archived on Tesla’s website.
- In February 2023, Tesla investors lodged a class-action lawsuit in San Francisco accusing Elon Musk and his company of 'deceptive and misleading marketing of ADAS technology' - specifically Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies.
- 'Although these promises have proven false time and time again, Tesla and Musk have continued making them to generate media attention, to deceive consumers into believing it has unrivaled cutting-edge technology, and to establish itself as a leading player in the fast-growing electric vehicle market,' the suit states.
- Responding to a data leak to Handelsblatt showing thousands of customer complaints about self-acceleration issues, braking problems, including 'unintentional emergency braking', and 'phantom stopping', the company 'demanded that the data be deleted and spoke of data theft.'

- In this article
- A federal agency is calling for tougher requirements on testing autonomous driving, and the proposed changes could eventually force Tesla to change how it rolls out features to customers.
- The National Transportation Safety Board is calling for stronger federal requirements for the design and use of automated driving systems on public roads. In a letter to its sister agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, dated last month and not yet reported on, NTSB chief Robert Sumwalt named Tesla 16 times in calling for sweeping change.
- "Tesla recently released a beta version of its Level 2 Autopilot system, described as having full self-driving capability. By releasing the system, Tesla is testing on public roads a highly automated AV technology but with limited oversight or reporting requirements," Sumwalt wrote. "NHTSA's hands-off approach to oversight of AV testing poses a potential risk to motorists and other road users."
- While both the NTSB and NHTSA are vehicle safety watchdogs in the U.S. government, their roles are distinct.
- The NTSB investigates accidents to determine underlying causes of damaging incidents, including fatal Tesla crashes involving Autopilot in Mountain View, California, in March 2018 and Del Ray Beach, Florida, in March 2019. The board also makes safety recommendations to regulators and the auto industry.
- It's up to its sister agency, the NHTSA, to mandate recalls of any vehicles, systems or parts deemed defective or unsafe for use. It also falls within the NHTSA's purview to establish standards and reporting requirements for vehicle safety and design, including fuel economy standards.
- A federal crackdown could hamper Tesla's ability to test its Full Self-Driving systems the way it does today — using customers and public roads as test pilots and proving grounds.
- In the past, NHTSA has hesitated to regulate automated driving systems from the likes of Tesla, GM, Volvo, and a bevy of other automakers and tech companies including Amazon's Zoox, Alphabet's Waymo and a number of start-ups.
- The agency's Deputy Administrator James Owens has said he did not want to "stymie innovation" with premature regulation. Instead, the agency left the task mostly to states.
- Today, Tesla sells a premium software package for $10,000 and markets it as "Full Self Driving" (or FSD). The company said it will soon make FSD available on a subscription basis for those who want it but don't want to pay the up-front fee.
- Tesla gives select customers early access to a beta version of FSD as well — effectively turning customers into software testers. CEO Elon Musk recently encouraged customers with FSD to sign up for beta access.
- Besides FSD, Tesla vehicles include a standard set of automated driving features, dubbed Autopilot.
- Despite those names — which imply to some drivers that they can operate Tesla electric vehicles hands-free — the company cautions in its owners' manual that Autopilot and FSD require active supervision.
- Musk repeatedly hypes Autopilot and FSD to his massive following on Twitter and in media interviews, but in correspondence with regulators, and in the fine print of Tesla financial filings, the company's legal team refers to these systems in a more subdued and precise tone.
- On April 22, 2019, at the company's Autonomy Day presentation, the CEO promised that Tesla's self-driving tech would be so good, Tesla would be making cars with no steering wheels or pedals in two years. At that same event, he talked about a custom chip designed to enable self-driving features.
- On May 2, 2019, Musk confidently told investors on a fundraising call that autonomous driving would transform his electric vehicle business into a company with a $500 billion market cap. A few days later, Tesla closed an over-subscribed $2.7 billion offering of stock and convertible notes. At the time, its market cap was under $50 billion; now it's more than $600 billion.
- This year, Musk said on the Feb 11 episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, "I think Autopilot's getting good enough that you won't need to drive most of the time unless you really want to."
- And yet, in sharp contrast with Musk's promises, Tesla calls its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving option merely "advanced driver assist systems," according to the company's most recent financial filing. And in correspondence last year with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, Tesla categorized its Full Self-Driving option as only "level 2."
- "Level 2," refers to vehicles that have some automated functions, but require drivers to remain attentive and keep their hands on the wheel. The highest level, level 5, would be a completely autonomous vehicle that never requires driver intervention.
- The DMV correspondence was first obtained by Think Computer Foundation and published by Plainsite, an online database of public records and court documents that can be otherwise difficult to access.
- CNBC reached out to Tesla and the company's acting general counsel, Al Prescott, for comment, but they did not immediately respond.
- Sumwalt's requests of the NHTSA seem straightforward: He called on the agency to require automakers to include collision avoidance systems in all their vehicles — the NTSB has investigated multiple Tesla Autopilot incidents —to provide robust driver monitoring systems, and to add safeguards that ensure drivers won't use automated driving systems beyond the conditions and domains in which it is safe to do so.
- Specific to Tesla, he recommended that NHTSA look at Tesla vehicles with Autopilot "to determine if the system's operating limitations, the foreseeability of driver misuse, and the ability to operate the vehicles outside the intended ODD [operational design domain] pose an unreasonable risk to safety." He added, "To date, NHTSA has shown no indication that it is prepared to respond effectively and in a timely manner to potential AV safety-related defects."
- Sumwalt also wants the NHTSA to make safety reporting to the feds more specific and mandatory. Autonomous vehicle developers can currently volunteer their data, but don't have to report it.
- Despite Sumwalt's criticism of the current processes, he lauded the NHTSA for engaging and collaborating with his agency, along with state and local governments to arrive at the right balance of rules and regulations around emerging vehicle technologies.
- Clear rules from one central office could help the autonomous vehicle industry in the U.S. overall, says the CEO of Snow Bull Capital's Taylor Ogan. Federal rules, even if stringent, could align states and local authorities and reduce the patchwork of separate regulations around autonomous vehicles in each region, he said.
- Ogan is a long time Tesla owner and proponent of Tesla and electric vehicles. His firm, Snow Bull, is a hedge fund that has historically been long Tesla, and does not short any stocks.
- He personally drives a 2020 Model Y performance Tesla loaded with the Full Self-Driving option. It's his fourth Tesla. The investor said, based on his personal use of the vehicle, that he believes Tesla's is the best level 2 system on the market in the US today.
- However, Ogan said, "My car cannot navigate autonomously in a parking lot, so I don't know why people think these will operate as robotaxis. Our opinion is that Tesla cannot achieve Level 3 or Level 4 autonomy – which means no robotaxis -- any time soon with their current hardware."
- In his view, competitors are already surpassing Tesla on self-driving in China, where the company faces competition from Nio, Xpeng and a joint venture between Didi Chuxing and BYD that's developing a ride-hailing "robotaxi" called the D1.
- Here's the full letter from NTSB to NHTSA:
- Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the NTSB is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. It was made independent from the DOT in 1974.

- By  Sean O'Kane
- Tesla is making owners who opt in to the controversial beta version of its “Full Self-Driving” software sign non-disclosure agreements and is also discouraging them from sharing video clips that show the driver assistance system making mistakes.
- According to a copy of the NDA obtained by Vice, Tesla tells those who sign the document that “there are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail; Don’t let them mischaracterize your feedback and media posts.” The company also says owners in the beta should “share on social media responsibly and selectively” and “consider sharing fewer videos, and only the ones that you think are interesting or worthy of being shared.”
- Vice’s report comes as Tesla is now working on expanding access to the “Full Self-Driving” software, all while the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigates the company’s less-advanced Autopilot driver assistance system currently available on its cars.
- “there are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail”
- Tesla has allowed a small group of die-hard owners to test the beta version of the “Full Self-Driving” software for about a year now. Some of them take their roles as “beta testers” quite seriously and try to find flaws in the system in an effort to help Tesla make the software better. Many also film themselves traveling around with the software running. Some compress their longer drives into supercuts, speeding up the footage to emphasize just how far the software can take them without human intervention. Others post the raw footage, warts and all.
- (As always, to be clear: this software does not make Tesla’s cars fully autonomous. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has himself even said that he believes the “feature complete” version of the software his company calls “Full Self-Driving” will, at best, only be “likely” to drive someone from their home to work without human intervention and will still require supervision. That does not describe a fully autonomous car.)
- This whole process — the years of unfulfilled claims of being able to make fully autonomous cars, the idea of beta testing in-development drivers assistance software on public streets with untrained owners behind the wheel — has drawn Musk and Tesla a lot of scrutiny. Recently, though, a clip from a video originally shot by Tesla owner and investor Galileo Russell went viral and charged the conversation even more.
- A few people in the “Full Self-Driving” beta show the software with no edits, warts and all
- In it, Russell’s car should be merging left, but it suddenly takes a dive to the right, eventually pointing straight at pedestrians in a crosswalk. A hedge fund owner shared this clip on Twitter, where many people (rightfully) were aghast at how close the car came to running over pedestrians.
- In a follow-up video, Russell made a passing mention about how Tesla “doesn’t want” people in the beta sharing clips that look bad while making a larger point explaining why he posted the video to begin with. But it wasn’t until Vice reported on the NDA this week that it was clear what he meant.
- Tesla is using this language to try and control the public perception of its “Full Self-Driving” software as the company starts to open up access to a much wider group — despite the software still being in development. Tesla added a button to the user interface of its cars this past weekend that lets owners request to be a part of the beta. It also launched a “safety score” system, which monitors drivers who apply and evaluates them on a number of metrics, like braking habits or aggressive acceleration.
- At the moment, Musk says drivers with a perfect safety score of 100 will be accepted into the beta, though he tweeted that Tesla will lower that bar. He also said Tesla will soon start adding up to 1,000 new owners per day to the beta, a dramatic expansion of who will be able to test the driver assistance software out on public roads.
- Expanding access is sure to bring even more attention to Tesla and Musk’s patchwork approach to rolling out the “Full Self-Driving” software. In fact, it already has. Last week, National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy told the Wall Street Journal that she wished the company would address “basic safety issues” before allowing new owners into the program. Homendy was one of the more outspoken board members during a 2020 hearing that found Autopilot to be partially at fault for the 2018 death of a driver in Mountain View, California.
- Tesla doesn’t appear to be changing course, though. Over the weekend, in response to a blog post about her comments, Musk tweeted a link to Homendy’s Wikipedia page — which eventually had to be locked after a sudden rush of edits.

URL: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/california-regulator-claims-tesla-falsely-advertised-autopilot-full-self-driving-2022-08-05/
- WASHINGTON/NEW YORK Aug 5 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), the electric car company run by billionaire Elon Musk, has been accused by a California state transportation regulator of falsely advertising its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features as providing autonomous vehicle control.
- In complaints filed with the state Office of Administrative Hearings, California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) said Tesla misled prospective customers with advertising that overstated how well its advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) worked.
- Tesla "made or disseminated statements that are untrue or misleading, and not based on facts," the DMV said in complaints dated July 28 and which it made public on Friday.
- Vehicles equipped with Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technology "could not at the time of those advertisements, and cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles," the DMV added.
- The DMV is seeking remedies that could include suspending Tesla's license to sell vehicles in California and requiring the company to make restitution to drivers.
- Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department, did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.
- The Los Angeles Times earlier reported the DMV complaints.
- Tesla has said Autopilot "enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane," while Full-Self Driving also enables vehicles to obey traffic signals and make lane changes.
- According to Tesla's website, both technologies "require active driver supervision," with a "fully attentive" driver whose hands are on the wheel, "and do not make the vehicle autonomous."
- But the DMV said Tesla's disclaimer "contradicts the original untrue or misleading labels and claims, which is misleading, and does not cure the violation."
- California is Tesla's largest U.S. market. The company sold 121,000 vehicles there in 2021, out of an estimated 352,000 sold nationwide.
- Since 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened 38 special investigations of crashes involving Tesla vehicles where ADAS systems were suspected of being used. Nineteen deaths were reported from those crashes, including a motorcyclist killed last month in Utah.
- NHTSA had no immediate comment on the DMV complaints.
- National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy in a Reuters interview last year said "there is zero comparison” between Tesla's Autopilot and the tool used in aviation.
- "Some manufacturers are going to do what they want to do to sell a car and it's up the government to rein that in," she said.

- Tesla is voluntarily recalling 362,758 vehicles equipped with the company's experimental driver-assistance software, which is marketed as Full Self-Driving Beta or FSD Beta, in the US, according to a recall notice out Thursday. Tesla will deliver an over-the-air software update to cars to address the issues, the recall notice said.
- The FSD Beta system may cause crashes by allowing the affected vehicles to: "Act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution," according to a safety recall report on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
- The FSD Beta system may also have trouble responding appropriately "to changes in posted speed limits," the notice said.
- The group of affected vehicles included the following years and models: 2016-2023 Model S and Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with or pending installation of FSD Beta.
- CEO Elon Musk and Tesla fans have objected to the use of the term "recall" to describe safety defects or issues that can be fixed with a software update delivered over wireless internet. On Thursday, he wrote on Twitter, "The word 'recall' for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!"
- Tesla lets thousands of drivers try new and unfinished driver assistance features on public roads in the U.S. through FSD Beta. The technology does not make Tesla electric cars autonomous, nor safe to drive without a human at the wheel ready to brake or steer at any second — despite the brand name.
- Only Tesla owners who have the company's premium FSD driver assistance system installed in their cars can join the FSD Beta program. That option now costs $15,000 up front or $199 per month in the U.S. Owners must obtain a high driver-safety score, as determined by Tesla software that monitors their driving habits, and maintain it to get FSD Beta access.
- FSD Beta can best be summarized as a host of new features that are not yet fully debugged. The main attraction is "autosteer on city streets," which lets a Tesla navigate around complex urban environments automatically, if imperfectly.
- Tesla has never disclosed how many people buy or subscribe to the premium FSD option. In the company's last earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said: "As of now, we've deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets -- to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy."
- NHTSA and Tesla communications say the system is something much simpler: a "SAE level 2 driver support feature that can provide steering and braking/acceleration support to the driver under certain operating limitations."
- The safety recall report notes, "the driver is responsible for operation of the vehicle whenever the feature is engaged and must constantly supervise the feature and intervene (e.g., steer, brake or accelerate) as needed to maintain safe operation of the vehicle."
- Shares of Tesla fell a little more than 1% on the news, then quickly recovered.

- Jan 17 (Reuters) - A 2016 video that Tesla (TSLA.O) used to promote its self-driving technology was staged to show capabilities like stopping at a red light and accelerating at a green light that the system did not have, according to testimony by a senior engineer.
- The video, which remains archived on Tesla’s website, was released in October 2016 and promoted on Twitter by Chief Executive Elon Musk as evidence that “Tesla drives itself.”
- But the Model X was not driving itself with technology Tesla had deployed, Ashok Elluswamy, director of Autopilot software at Tesla, said in the transcript of a July deposition taken as evidence in a lawsuit against Tesla for a 2018 fatal crash involving a former Apple (AAPL.O) engineer.
- The previously unreported testimony by Elluswamy represents the first time a Tesla employee has confirmed and detailed how the video was produced.
- The video carries a tagline saying: “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.”
- Elluswamy said Tesla’s Autopilot team set out to engineer and record a “demonstration of the system’s capabilities” at the request of Musk.
- Elluswamy, Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has warned drivers that they must keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of their vehicles while using Autopilot.
- The Tesla technology is designed to assist with steering, braking, speed and lane changes but its features “do not make the vehicle autonomous,” the company says on its website.
- To create the video, the Tesla used 3D mapping on a predetermined route from a house in Menlo Park, California, to Tesla’s then-headquarters in Palo Alto, he said.
- Drivers intervened to take control in test runs, he said. When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.
- “The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Elluswamy said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.
- When Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”
- Tesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.
- The U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.
- The New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.
- When asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, "It does not."
- Elluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang.
- Andrew McDevitt, the lawyer who represents Huang’s wife and who questioned Elluswamy’s in July, told Reuters it was “obviously misleading to feature that video without any disclaimer or asterisk.”
- The National Transportation Safety Board concluded in 2020 that Huang’s fatal crash was likely caused by his distraction and the limitations of Autopilot. It said Tesla’s “ineffective monitoring of driver engagement” had contributed to the crash.
- Elluswamy said drivers could “fool the system,” making a Tesla system believe that they were paying attention based on feedback from the steering wheel when they were not. But he said he saw no safety issue with Autopilot if drivers were paying attention.
