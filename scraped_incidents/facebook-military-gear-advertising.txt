- Non-profit Tech Transparency Project has discovered that Facebook has been running adverts for military gear and weapons accessories next to posts about the January 6 attempted coup in Washington DC.
- The finding raises questions about the effectiveness of the social network's content safety measures. It also prompted a number of Democrat senators to ask Mark Zuckerberg to permanently block ads of products clearly designed to be used in armed combat.
- Facebook later said it would ban ads for weapon accessories and protective equipment in the US 'out of an abundance of caution' until at least two days after Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, 2021.
- TTP's discovery comes weeks after it had found that Facebook was permitting US militia groups to run recruitment ads on its platform.

- Facebook has been serving up ads for weapons accessories and body armor alongside election misinformation and insurrection talk in “patriot” and militia groups, according to research by the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), revealing an alarming blind spot in Facebook’s moderation efforts just days before an inauguration threatened by extremist violence.
- TTP’s research, shared with BuzzFeed News, showed how Facebook continued to run ads for things like gun holsters and rifle enhancements in these far-right groups after the deadly Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot. BuzzFeed also reported that such ads had been flagged internally by concerned Facebook employees.
- Facebook promised days later to pause ads for gun accessories and military gear until after the inauguration, but TTP and BuzzFeed continued to find them after Facebook’s announcement. The findings highlight how Facebook profits from extremist content, contributes to radicalization, and struggles to meet its enforcement promises.
- TTP spotted the advertising via a monitoring profile it uses to track far-right and militia movements on Facebook. The account’s only activity involves “liking” Facebook pages and joining Facebook groups that are engaged in far-right and militant activity; it does not interact with user posts or communicate in the groups.
- Maintaining a profile like this has provided a first-hand look at the kind of content pushed by Facebook’s algorithms. Below is a timeline of TTP’s investigation on the military gear ads.
- 
- TTP identified multiple advertisements for weapons accessories and body armor alongside election misinformation and insurrection content in Facebook patriot and militia groups. BuzzFeed News, which reported on the findings, also noted that Facebook employees had flagged some of the same ads internally at the company.
- Military gear ads on Facebook
- Military gear ads on Facebook
- Public officials took notice. In a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Sens. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) urged Zuckerberg to “take immediate action” to remove ads that promote or sell products “designed to equip white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other domestic extremist organizations to engage in violent insurrection and seditious conspiracy” against the U.S. Constitution and government.
- The attorney generals of Washington, D.C., Illinois, New Jersey, and Massachusetts also called on Facebook to halt such advertising, highlighting the fact that many rioters at the Capitol “wore military-style tactical gear in preparation for a confrontation”—the same type of gear featured in the Facebook ads.
- That same day, TTP also found that Facebook's algorithms were recommending “Suggested Pages” for nationalist and militia groups in between ads for military-style body armor, potentially fueling radicalization. Militia pages continue to be active on Facebook despite the platform’s August 2020 crackdown on “militarized social movements.”
- See how it works:
- TTP has previously documented how Facebook’s recommended pages create an echo chamber for white supremacists.
- Following the backlash from lawmakers and others over the weapons accessories ads, Facebook announced it was “banning ads that promote weapon accessories and protective equipment in the US at least through Jan. 22, out of an abundance of caution.”“We already prohibit ads for weapons, ammunition and weapon enhancements like silencers. But we will now also prohibit ads for accessories such as gun safes, vests and gun holsters in the US,” the statement read.
- However, on the following day, ads for armor and weapons accessories had still not been removed. TTP also found Facebook pushing an ad for bulletproof body armor and backpacks next to a recommendation for a page belonging to the Three Percenters, which the Anti-Defamation League describes as an anti-government extremist militia.
- YouTube says it delivers ‘responsible’ video recommendations. But its algorithms steered accounts for young gamers toward content on guns, school shootings, and a serial killer.
- Vance has called for repeal of Section 230 legal protections, but only for big tech platforms. That would benefit his investment Rumble, a right-wing alternative to YouTube.
- Google says a ‘broad cross-section’ of experts, academics, and organizations support its legal position. The company is paying many of them.
- Facebook says it bans U.S.-designated terrorist groups. But the platform has generated more than 100 pages for groups like Islamic State and Al Qaeda.

- Facebook has allowed dangerous militia groups to run recruiting ads that reached tens of thousands of users and is still enabling such groups to organize on the platform, according to a Tech Transparency Project (TTP) investigation that highlights deep flaws in the company’s handling of domestic extremists.
- The investigation—which follows news of a thwarted plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, which involved militia members and played out on Facebook and other social media—shows how Facebook has repeatedly failed to block these violence-prone groups from using its various tools and features to build their movement.
- TTP found that numerous militia groups, over the past several years and as recently as August, have used Facebook ads to recruit new members, with messages calling militia men the “last hope of freedom” and imploring, “Fight with us to take back America.” That means Facebook has been directly profiting from this kind of paid messaging on its platform.
- At the same time, the investigation identified more than 50 Facebook pages and groups dedicated to militia organizations, including some associated with the so-called Three Percenters, an anti-government extremist movement. The activity is continuing despite Facebook’s announced action against “militarized social movements” two months ago.
- The disturbing findings show that Facebook is routinely behind the curve in cracking down on domestic extremists on its platform—a pattern that played out in the Whitmer case and threatens additional harm heading into the Nov. 3 election, amid President Donald Trump’s baseless accusations about voter fraud and a “rigged” result.
- Here are of the main takeaways from TTP’s investigation:
- For years, Facebook allowed militia group pages to run recruitment ads, which evidently made it through the platform’s review process for advertising.
- As recently as mid-August, a Facebook ad for a group called New Mexico Light Foot issued a call for new members, expressing its allegiance to the 2nd Amendment with an image of an semi-automatic rifle. (“Light foot” refers to privately organized local militia battalions.) Another ad for America’s United Militia touted the group’s mission to “uphold and support the constitution,” adding, “Fight with us to take back America.” That ad had up to 45,000 “impressions,” indicating how many times it appeared on a screen.
- The Facebook page for “Virginia Militia” ran a total of 61 ads. One of its last ads from February 2020 promoted a “Muster Call,” with the message, “Are you going to give up your rights or fight?” TTP also found an ad campaign for a Facebook page called “My Militia – American Patriot Community.” The page ran political ads in fall 2018 ahead of the midterm elections, with the message “The red wave is rising” and “It’s not revenge we are after, but a reckoning.” After the midterms, the group took out recruitment ads calling American militia men “the last hope of freedom” and urging users to “join your local militia today.”
- The militia pages that purchased these ads have since been deleted, most likely by Facebook. The company on August 19 announced a crackdown on “militarized social movements,” saying it would “limit the spread” of such content and remove pages and groups that feature “discussions of potential violence.” The company added on Sept. 30 that it would prohibit anyone from running ads that “praise, support or represent” such movements.
- But Facebook never addressed the issue of how it profited from militia recruitment ads or what, if anything, it would do with the revenue it received from them.
- Meanwhile, there appear to be blind spots in Facebook’s enforcement. An ad from the American Patriot Council this month said militias are “strongly encouraged” to attend an Oct. 24 “freedom march” in cities across the country, calling it “a show of solidarity” and a chance to “demand emancipation from the bondage of tyranny.”
- Facebook has a history of inaction on dangerous groups using its advertising and fundraising tools. A BuzzFeed News report on June 30 found that the company had been allowing ads for the “boogaloo” movement, which envisions a violent uprising against the government. (TTP has tracked Facebook’s repeated failures to deal with the spread of boogaloo groups, which have been linked on several occasions to real-world physical attacks.)
- Last month, TTP discovered that the neo-fascist street gang Proud Boys had been using Facebook’s fundraising tools to raise money for a rally in Portland, Oregon. Facebook banned the Proud Boys in 2018, but didn’t take action on the fundraising activity until a HuffPost reporter contacted the company about TTP’s findings. Facebook takes a fee from such fundraising through its platform.
- Despite its ongoing crackdown on “militarized social movements,” Facebook continues to allow militia activity on the platform. TTP found 45 pages and eight groups dedicated to militia organizations that remained active on Facebook as of Oct. 13. Some of them featured logos and images affiliated with the Three Percenters, which the Southern Poverty Law Center calls a “core component” of the anti-government militia movement.
- Incredibly, 13 of the pages and groups have “militia” in their name, raising questions about the effectiveness of Facebook’s crackdown. Six pages and one group were created after Facebook’s Aug. 19 announcement targeting “militarized social movements.”
- One example of the ongoing activity is the Facebook group “Arkansas Minutemen 1776,” which was created on September 22. By October 13, the group had amassed more than 650 members and featured documents detailing its “Standard Operating Procedure” and applications to join the militia. The group features violent talk and memes related to the upcoming election. In response to a post stating that people are “scared” about what Democrats will do, a member of the militia Facebook group replied, “NOT SCARED JUST WORRIED IF I HAVE ENOUGH AMMO.”
- Following the news of the thwarted kidnapping plot targeting Gov. Whitmer—which played out in various ways on Facebook—the company told Bloomberg News that it reached out to the FBI early in the investigation, and takes down content when it's reported to law enforcement if there is a “credible threat of imminent harm to people or public safety.”
- Facebook also said the company had removed Michigan militia groups since August, including Michigan Liberty Militia and the Michigan Militia Corps. At least two members of the Michigan Liberty Militia were reportedly arrested in connection with the Whitmer plot.
- But TTP that same week found a number of Michigan militia pages still active on Facebook, including another page for the Michigan Liberty Militia—which Facebook said it removed—under a slightly altered name, “MLM Michigan Liberty minutemen.” The findings, shared with BuzzFeed News, are part of a pattern in which Facebook announces an enforcement action but misses simple name changes that allow targeted groups to evade detection. The same dynamic has played out with boogaloo groups.
- TTP identified another troubling aspect of Facebook’s treatment of Michigan militia groups. As demonstrated in the video below, if a user “liked” the Facebook page for MLM Michigan Liberty minutemen, the platform’s “related pages” feature suggested other militia groups, including “MCM Standing Together, Defending Together,” a variant of the Michigan Constitutional Militia. This shows how Facebook’s recommendation engine continues to point users to dangerous groups, potentially accelerating radicalization.
- Facebook removed several of the pages after being contacted by BuzzFeed, including MLM Michigan Liberty minutemen, MCM Standing Together, Defending Together, the “Michigan Minutemen Platoon,” and “Great Lakes Light Infantry.”
- However, some of the pages remained active on Facebook as of October 13: “US Wolf Pack Militia,” “SMVM Jackson County,” and “North West Michigan Rangers” along with its accompanying Facebook group, “Friends of North West Michigan Rangers.” These are used to organize training efforts and share slogans about a coming civil war. Members of Friends of the North West Michigan Rangers group used images of the Michigan Liberty Militia flag, suggesting the groups are aligned.
- TTP has also observed members of militia groups comingling with boogaloo supporters and far-right Proud Boys in some Facebook groups, as various elements of the U.S. extremist movement look for places to gather amid Facebook’s piecemeal enforcement actions.
- One example is a public Facebook group called “Proud Patriot.” The group was created on September 14 under the name “The Angry Patriot,” but changed its name to “The Proud Patriot” on October 1, potentially to lure Proud Boys trying to evade Facebook’s algorithms. In its first three weeks of existence, the group gained 4,459 members—a rate of roughly 207 per day.
- The Proud Patriot group includes posts from self-declared Proud Boys who call for others to join their movement and share a logo featuring Trump’s comment at the recent presidential debate that Proud Boys should “stand back and stand by.” Some members of the Facebook group also called for joining local militias. One user said militias “will be on the front line ‘Taking Back Our Country !,” adding, “If your [sic] interested pm me !” Other members express support for the boogaloo movement in posts or comments.
- This activity continues despite statements by Facebook’s head of counterterrorism and dangerous organizations, Brian Fishman, touting the company’s vigilance in removing Proud Boys content after Trump’s debate comments.
- TTP also found Facebook pages for local and national militia groups that feature years-old, but still active, recruiting posts. Facebook users are still commenting on these old posts asking how to join up. Facebook has said it is “down-ranking” some kinds of militia content to make them less visible, which may be occurring in these cases, but the continued comments suggest that users are still being driven to such pages by Facebook’s recommendation engine.
- Some militia pages have pop-up automatic messenger windows that prompt users to contact page administrators—a feature that could facilitate militia recruiting. The pop-up provides users with a direct route to privately contact the admins, complete with pre-set messages users can send to convey interest. With this feature, Facebook is providing people with a direct line of communication to organizers of those militia groups.
- Facebook had ample heads-up about threats to Gov. Whitmer on its platform over the past year. In May, TTP found examples of this circulating in private boogaloo groups that were highlighted in an Associated Press report. One post from May 5 called for lynching Whitmer, saying the governor misunderstood “who the noose was for”—apparently referring to nooses brandished during a protest against coronavirus stay-at-home orders—while another replied, “let her swing.” Facebook finally removed that boogaloo group as part of a June 30 enforcement action.
- Members of private Facebook groups dedicated to “patriots” and Donald Trump have also posted explicit threats to kill public officials and protesters.
- Take the group called “Pro-Police, Pro-Military, Pro-Trump,” which has about 11,200 members. One member suggested on Oct. 5 that Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat who’s frequently targeted by racist and misogynist rhetoric, should be “sent to Guantanamo Bay,” a comment that sparked replies like “Just shoot the bitch” and “she needs a drone strike.” Despite Facebook’s statement that it removes content that poses a “credible threat of imminent harm to people or public safety,” the threats to Rep. Omar remained active as of October 13.
- A Facebook group called “Trump’s Army,” which has roughly 99,900 members, features violent talk about people demonstrating over the police killing of Breonna Taylor. One member wrote, “All Trump supporters should shoot them and kill them,” prompting a reply, “working on it.”
- Facebook has faced increasing pressure over its inability or unwillingness to remove dangerous militia content since the events in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in late August.
- The company allowed a Kenosha Guard militia page to stay up after it called on followers to bring weapons to a local protest, despite the fact that users flagged the issue to Facebook a reported 455 times. A 17-year-old gunmen is accused of killing two protesters and injuring a third that night. CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the failure to remove Kenosha Guard’s post an “operational mistake,” though it later emerged, via BuzzFeed, that an administrator for the page eventually removed the event—not Facebook, as the company had previously suggested.
- The Kenosha tragedy highlights how Facebook’s tools can be used for militia organizing—and the potentially deadly consequences. But TTP’s investigation shows that Facebook’s effort to curb militia activity leaves some gaping holes, which are cause for alarm amid growing concern about domestic extremism.

- Update on Saturday, January 16, 2021 at 11:00AM PT:
- We are banning ads that promote weapon accessories and protective equipment in the US at least through January 22, out of an abundance of caution. We already prohibit ads for weapons, ammunition and weapon enhancements like silencers. But we will now also prohibit ads for accessories such as gun safes, vests and gun holsters in the US.
- Update on January 15, 2021 at 1:57PM PT:
- We’re monitoring for signals of violence or other threats both in Washington, D.C. and across all 50 states. In the lead up to Inauguration Day, we have implemented a series of additional measures to continue preventing attempts to use our services for violence. This includes our ongoing pause on all political advertising. And, as we did in the weeks after the presidential election, we are promoting accurate information about the election and the violence at the Capitol instead of content that our systems predict may be less accurate, delegitimizes the election or portrays the rioters as victims. We have also implemented specific measures to reduce opportunities for abuse in Groups.
- Building on these steps, we have added two additional measures to further prevent people from trying to use our services to incite violence.
- We will continue to monitor and add additional measures as needed.
- Originally published on January 11, 2021 at 1:05PM PT:
- We began preparing for Inauguration Day last year. But our planning took on new urgency after last week’s violence in Washington, D.C., and we are treating the next two weeks as a major civic event. We’re taking additional steps and using the same teams and technologies we used during the general election to stop misinformation and content that could incite further violence during these next few weeks.
- We are now removing content containing the phrase “stop the steal” under our Coordinating Harm policy from Facebook and Instagram. We removed the original Stop the Steal group in November and have continued to remove Pages, groups and events that violate any of our policies, including calls for violence. We’ve been allowing robust conversations related to the election outcome and that will continue. But with continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the US presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the term by those involved in Wednesday’s violence in DC, we’re taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration. It may take some time to scale up our enforcement of this new step but we have already removed a significant number of posts.
- Our teams are working 24/7 to enforce our policies around the inauguration. We will keep our Integrity Operations Center operating at least through January 22 to monitor and respond to threats in real time. We already had it active ahead of Georgia’s runoff elections and Congress’s counting of the Electoral College votes in the US presidential election. We extended it due to the violence at the Capitol last week.
- As was the case through the 2020 elections, we’ve continued to proactively reach out to federal and local law enforcement and we are providing information in response to valid legal requests. As always, we will continue to remove content, disable accounts and work with law enforcement when there is a risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.
- In addition to the indefinite suspension of President Trump’s account that we announced on January 7, we’re keeping our pause in place on all ads in the US about politics or elections. This means that we aren’t allowing any ads from politicians, including President Trump.
- We are also connecting people with reliable information and high-quality news about the inauguration and the transition process. After the inauguration, our label on posts that attempt to delegitimize the election results will reflect that Joe Biden is the sitting president. Our Voting Information Center will stay active on Facebook and Instagram through the inauguration so it can continue to help people find reliable information and updates about the electoral process.
- During inauguration week, we will add a news digest to Facebook News as a curated place for people to find reliable news about the inauguration. This will include live video of the inauguration at the US Capitol on January 20. Facebook News often includes news digests dedicated to events of national or global significance, such as “COVID-19” or “Unrest in America” with stories selected by the curation team. There will also be curated live video of the inauguration and other major moments on Facebook Watch.
- We’ve had emergency measures in place since before the US elections such as not recommending civic groups for people to join. Last week, we implemented several additional ones, including increasing the requirement of Group admins to review and approve posts before they can go up, automatically disabling comments on posts in Groups that start to have a high rate of hate speech or content that incites violence, and using AI to further demote content that likely violates our policies. We’re keeping these measures in place.
- We will stay vigilant to additional threats and take further action if necessary to keep people safe and informed.

- Earlier this week, Facebook employees warned that military product ads were being advertised against news about DC riots. The company did not act.
- BuzzFeed News Reporter
- BuzzFeed Staff
- Facebook has been running ads for body armor, gun holsters, and other military equipment next to content promoting election misinformation and news about the attempted coup at the US Capitol, despite internal warnings from concerned employees.
- In the aftermath of an attempted insurrection by President Donald Trump’s supporters last week at the US Capitol building, Facebook has served up ads for defense products to accounts that follow extremist content, according to the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit watchdog group. Those ads — which include New Year’s specials for specialized body armor plates, rifle enhancements, and shooting targets — were all delivered to a TTP Facebook account used to monitor right-wing content that could incite violence.
- Beginning last summer, the Mark Zuckerberg–led company banned pages, groups, and accounts belonging to US-based militant groups, “boogaloo” extremists, and those associated with the QAnon mass delusion. But members of those movements quickly found ways around the company’s policies by renaming their pages or using code names. They continue to proliferate, organize, and advertise on the social network.
- These ads for tactical gear, which were flagged internally by employees as potentially problematic, show Facebook has been profiting from content that amplifies political and cultural discord in the US.
- "Facebook has spent years facilitating fringe voices who use the platform to organize and amplify calls for violence,” said TTP Director Katie Paul. “As if that weren't enough, Facebook's advertising microtargeting is directing domestic extremists toward weapons accessories and armor that can make their militarized efforts more effective, all while Facebook profits."
- In a statement that did not address BuzzFeed News’ questions about specific ads, pages, or groups, Facebook spokesperson Liz Bourgeois said, “Our teams are working to stay ahead of any militia groups that try to evade” the social network’s ban.
- She added, "We don’t allow ads that praise, support, or represent militarized social movements, and ban ads that promote the sale or use of weapons, ammunition, or explosives."
- Delaware Sen. Chris Coons said that in light of last week’s assault on the Capitol, Facebook needed to “conduct a robust review of all of its business practices, not just the content it hosts.”
- In a statement to BuzzFeed News, he said, “It’s clear after last week’s assault on the Capitol that social media companies, including Facebook, need to take additional steps to prevent violence and extremism from taking root on their platforms — whether by hosting content that incites or organizes violence or by making it easier for those with bad intentions to obtain military gear.”
- On Wednesday morning, ads for military-grade tactical gear ads appeared in the News Feed of a TTP-run Facebook account designed to mimic the online habits of someone who followed extremist content on the platform. The year-old account was designed to look like that of a 32-year-old man based in Covington, Kentucky, who follows or is part of more than 75 pages or groups that share pro-Trump memes, election misinformation, or outright calls for violence.
- These pages include “RAPID Militia,” “Modern Militia,” and “Appalachian Mountain Patriots” (formerly “Appalachian Oath Keepers”). Facebook banned militant groups in August; the Oath Keepers is a far-right anti-government organization that has been prohibited by the platform.
- The TTP account does not post or like any of the content Facebook delivers to it, though Paul does scroll through the feed and follows links for her research. While the account does not follow the pages of Donald Trump or his son Donald Trump Jr., Facebook deemed those two figures to be part of the account’s “interest categories,” which also include the “Republican Party (United States),” “American football,” and “Politics.” Facebook users do not specify their interest categories, which are determined by the social network’s algorithms based on a person’s on-platform activity.
- Paul showed BuzzFeed News a live video of the activity on the account’s feed on Wednesday morning.
- In the News Feed, an ad for “high-quality American-made holsters” ran above a post falsely claiming that the recent presidential election had been stolen. The ad was targeted to people over the age of 18 whose primary location is the US, according to a Facebook informational panel. A different video ad for a flashlight and laser pointer that could be attached to a semiautomatic rifle was shown next to a post from a group that promotes booglaoo content. Members of the boogaloo movement, a loose network of anti-government extremists who advocate for civil war, have previously been charged with killing law enforcement officers.
- While Facebook prohibits ads for firearm sales and gun modifications, advertisers are allowed to use the platform and its audience-targeting capabilities to sell weapon accessories. The advertised products seen by BuzzFeed News included gun belts, steel targets, and body armor.
- Pro-Trump rioters gather in the Rotunda of the US Capitol on Jan. 6.
- Because Facebook is a highly personalized platform, it’s unclear which specific demographics have been targeted for tactical gear advertising. The company, which was expected to record $80 billion in revenue in 2020, typically does not disclose detailed targeting information for nonpolitical ads.
- “You have all the other survival gear so why are you missing one of the most essential pieces of equipment for when SHTF,” read one ad for an armored vest, using an initialism for “shit hits the fan.” The ad contained an image of a semiautomatic rifle sitting atop a trunk, which also propped up the armor.
- The same ad was flagged inside Facebook on Monday by a concerned employee, according to postings seen by BuzzFeed News on Workplace, the social network’s internal forum for workers.
- “IMO it’s a set of products we’d be better off not advertising, especially not when combined with a rifle in the graphic, and it is at best terrible timing,” the person wrote. A reviewer of the ads responded to the post to note that they “did not find enough violations to take down the ad,” igniting a vigorous debate among employees.
- In another Workplace group, a different Facebook worker reported that friends had found military gear ads served alongside news stories about the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol.
- “This looks serious to me because it can be read as 1) us profiting off of the events 2) encouraging people to take some kind direction to the events,” they wrote, attaching a video of what they were seeing.
- Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg
- On Monday, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg spoke at a Reuters conference at which she discussed the recent violence at the Capitol. In the interview, she said that Facebook had taken proactive measures to remove extremist content.
- “I think these events were largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate, and don’t have our standards, and don’t have our transparency,” Sandberg said. “But certainly, to this day we are working to find any single mention that may be leading to this and making sure we get it down as quickly as possible.”
- In a statement, Bourgeois, the company spokesperson, said that “Sheryl began [the talk] by noting these events were organized online, including on our platforms — with the clear suggestion we have a role here.”
- During Monday’s interview, Sandberg also addressed the proliferation of hate-related content on Facebook.
- “I think there’s a false belief that we somehow profit, that people somehow want to see this content,” she said. “That’s just not true.”
- As she spoke, a “Stop the Steal” group with more than 14,000 members was still active on the platform. While that group was later removed, others have replaced it, and Facebook is displaying ads next to their content.

- But on Sunday, BuzzFeed News continued to find ads for firearm accessories on the social network, more than 22 hours after Facebook announced its temporary suspension.
- BuzzFeed News Reporter
- BuzzFeed Staff
- Following complaints from Senators and employees, Facebook on Saturday said it was temporarily halting ads for gun accessories and military gear in the US through next week’s inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.
- The move follows a BuzzFeed News story that revealed the world’s largest social network displayed ads for gun holsters, body armor, and other military-related paraphernalia in the News Feeds of people who had engaged with content about the attempted coup at the US Capitol building earlier this month.
- “Out of an abundance of caution, we are temporarily banning ads promoting weapons accessories and protective equipment in the U.S. until at least January 22nd,” Facebook spokesperson Liz Bourgeois said. “We appreciate our employees, BuzzFeed’s reporting, and policymakers for raising this concern.”
- On Sunday, following publication of this story, BuzzFeed News continued to find ads for military tactical gear and firearm accessories on the social network, more than 22 hours after Facebook announced its temporary suspension.
- While Facebook already prohibited advertisements for guns, ammunition, and weapon enhancements like silencers, the company has still allowed ads for accessories including holsters and attachable flashlights and laser sights. Facebook users and employees noticed an uptick in ads for these products and military gear, including armored vests, on their News Feeds in the days following a riot at the Capitol that left five people dead.
- Ads for tactical gear were also being shown to people who followed right-wing extremist pages or groups on the social network. Research from the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit industry watchdog group, showed that a Facebook account set up by the organization to follow pages belonging to militant and white nationalist organizations on Facebook was regularly served ads for military gear in between posts casting doubt on the presidential election and others praising the assault on the US Capitol.
- Some of the ads played to the fears of Facebook’s users, asking them if they were adequately prepared for turmoil in the lead-up to Inauguration Day.
- Following BuzzFeed News’ story about the ads, two sets of lawmakers and regulators wrote letters to Facebook on Friday. Sens. Tammy Duckworth, Richard Blumenthal, and Sherrod Brown excoriated Facebook for profiting during a time of civil unrest, and demanded that the company “immediately develop and execute a Facebook policy permanently prohibiting advertisements of products that a reasonable observer would interpret as primarily designed for use in lethal tactical operations and armed combat.”
- “Facebook must hold itself accountable for how domestic enemies of the United States have used the company’s products and platform to further their own illicit aims,” they wrote. “Whether through negligence or with full knowledge, Facebook is placing profit ahead of our Nation’s democracy.”
- In another letter, the attorneys general of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Illinois, and Washington, DC, asked that the company pause ads for the sale of weapons accessories and military gear.
- Facebook, which faced internal criticism from employees about the ads before and after BuzzFeed News’ Wednesday story, ultimately conceded to the less onerous request from the attorneys general.
- On Sunday, Facebook served an ad for ammunition in direct violation of its rules prohibiting the advertisement of guns and ammunition.
- On Sunday, however, the ads persisted. BuzzFeed News found multiple instances of advertisements for gun holsters and armored vests.
- The social network also served a 45-minute video ad for "long-range hunting and shooting" ammo from a prominent firearms company to the TTP account monitoring extremist activity. Facebook's rules expressly prohibit advertisements for the sale of ammunition.
- "A 2021 new ammo experience," the ad read, sandwiched between posts on the account's News Feed promising a new American revolution.
- Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.
- This story was updated on Sunday after BuzzFeed News continued to find instances of military gear and firearm accessory ads on Facebook following the company's announcement of the temporary suspension.

- Facebook announced on Saturday that it was banning ads that promote weapons accessories and protective equipment until Jan. 22, after President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, “out of an abundance of caution.”
- The company’s announcement came after a Buzzfeed News investigation found that Facebook was delivering ads for body armor, gun holsters, and other military equipment next to content promoting election misinformation and the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. According to Buzzfeed, the ads were also shown to people who followed right-wing extremist pages or groups on Facebook. The company was alerted to this practice by its own employees in recent days but chose not to take action until now.
- “This looks serious to me because it can be read as 1) us profiting off of the events 2) encouraging people to take some kind direction to the events,” a Facebook employee wrote on the company’s internal forum in relation to ads about military gear, per Buzzfeed.
- Facebook’s attempt to slow the spread of President Trump’s misinformation and outright lies by…
- In a blog post about its preparations ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, Facebook stated that it already banned ads for weapons, and that it would extend that prohibition to other products.
- “We are banning ads that promote weapon accessories and protective equipment in the US at least through January 22, out of an abundance of caution,” the company said. “We already prohibit ads for weapons, ammunition and weapon enhancements like silencers. But we will now also prohibit ads for accessories such as gun safes, vests and gun holsters in the US.”
- The ads prompted three U.S. senators to write a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg requesting him to act immediately and create a policy permanently banning ads for products “designed for use in lethal tactical operations and armed combat.”
- The Buzzfeed report also elicited a response from the attorneys general of Washington, D.C., Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, who in a letter asked Will Castleberry, Facebook’s vice president for U.S. state policy and community engagement, to place a moratorium on ads for weapons accessories and armor until Jan. 22 or until a time when the heightened threat of extremist violence subsides.
- The ban comes one day after Facebook blocked users from creating new events near the White House, the U.S. Capitol building, and any other state capitol building through Inauguration Day. The company said that it would also review the events related to the inauguration again and remove those that violated its policies, as well as continue to block non-U.S.-based accounts and pages from creating events in the U.S.
- Some restrictions also extended to certain people based in the U.S., Facebook said, who will be unable to create live videos, events, groups, or pages if they were found to be repeat violators of the company’s policies.
- Facebook’s internal security team has warned employees not to wear or carry any Facebook-branded…
- Social media platforms played a central role in the riot at the Capitol, led by supporters of President Donald Trump, which resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol police officer.
- Days before the event, the president’s supported promoted it extensively on Facebook and Instagram, owned by Facebook, the Washington Post reported. In fact, more than 100,000 users used hashtags such as #StopTheSteal or #FightForTrump. They also gathered on so-called “free speech” platforms like Parler and the walkie-talkie app Zello, among others, to conspire to overthrow the election.

- Despite last week’s insurrection, Facebook is continuing to show ads for weapon accessories, body armor, and other military gear on its site, according to the Tech Transparency Project (TTP), a nonprofit watchdog.
- TPP said it found evidence to suggest the ads are being shown to Facebook users who have shown interest in far-right and militia groups.
- The ads, which TTP says it saw on Facebook on Wednesday, included promotions for bulletproof vests and gun accessories.
- The ads appeared in the Facebook feed of an account TTP set up to resemble a far-right sympathizer. TPP used the account to join dozens of groups and pages dedicated to militia  groups and the far-right.
- A Facebook spokesperson told CNN, "We don’t allow ads that praise, support or represent militarized social movements and ban ads that promote the sale or use of weapons, ammunition, or explosives."
- The spokesperson also said Facebook has removed pages and groups representing militarized social movements and is continuing to take those pages down.
- BuzzFeed News first reported TTP’s findings.

- The Washington State Police is actively monitoring threats to the state capitol in Olympia and the agency is "preparing for anything," spokesperson Chris Loftis told CNN today.
- "What we're seeing are evolving threats over time," Loftis said.
- He explained the agency has seen "some general threats that we can tie to specific individuals and specific groups" that have centered around coming to the capitol to "wreak havoc and harm and keep the operations of the capitol from occurring as they normally do."
- "We do follow all the social media chatter and some of these groups are quite brazen," he added.
- Loftis explained that many of these threats and groups look "to make the point that they feel the election has been stolen and that the Covid restrictions that we have had in the state and others are somehow unconstitutional."
- He said the agency is working with FBI, other local law enforcement agencies, and other state agencies through a "fusion center" in Seattle.
- In addition to resources brought in from all eight of Washington State Patrol's districts, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee authorized 750 members of the National Guard to be activated, Loftis explained. As a result, "hundreds and hundreds" of personnel are at the state capitol around the clock.
- "Our position in all of this is that we're here to protect people's rights to free speech and we're here to protect the rights of assembly," Loftis added. But he cautioned "if you come onto campus, with intent to harm, whether it's the people the place or the process, we're going to respond, as law enforcement always does."

- The New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner John Miller said "the temperature is high" as it pertains to the current intelligence surrounding the inauguration.
- He said the NYPD will be sending 200 officers to Washington, DC, to assist federal partners with the policing during the inauguration. The officers will receive indoctrination and protocols and have special law enforcement powers for the time they are assisting federal counterparts.
- Miller said the idea the rioters were successful in getting into the Capitol, indicates it was a "significant milestone," for the movement.
- He went onto say there’s indication that the arrests made across the country may have hampered that movement.
- "The city of New York will do anything and everything within our power to assist the federal government," Miller continued.
- When asked which group out of the extremists concerns them the most, Miller said, "This is a loosely organized movement that largely gathers electronically and mobilizes electronically and the propensity of the violence sometimes boils down to the individual."
- Miller said the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York is working on identifying and arresting individuals who took part in the lawlessness.
- Out of an abundance of caution, Miller said, New Yorkers will see additional police resources around City Hall from Jan. 17 onwards, although he stressed there are no credible threats to New York City.

- Authorities have arrested two men, including one who was pictured in the US Capitol last week holding a Confederate flag during a riot, according to the Department of Justice.
- The men – Kevin Seefried and his son Hunter – were taken into custody Thursday in Delaware, according to a release. They are charged with entering restricted grounds and violent entry or disorderly conduct inside the Capitol, according to a criminal complaint in the DC District Court.
- Both Seefrieds spoke to the FBI separately about taking part in the crowd that breached the Capitol on Jan. 6.
- Prosecutors say the Seefrieds "entered the Senate Building through a broken window and, shortly thereafter, Kevin Seefried was photographed holding a Confederate Battle flag inside the Capitol Building."
- Kevin Seefried told the FBI he had brought the Confederate flag with him to Washington from his home in Delaware, where he normally displays it outside. The father-son duo had come to the nation's Capitol on Jan. 6 "to hear President Trump speak," and marched to the Capitol following a person with a bullhorn, they told the FBI, according to the court record.
- The FBI learned of the men's names after one of Hunter Seefried’s coworkers reported he had bragged about being inside the Capitol building with his father. Hunter Seefried is alleged to have punched glass out of a window in the Capitol, according to court documents made public on Thursday.
- This article has been updated to reflect that two men have now been charged.

- Colorado Democratic Rep. Jason Crow said that if President Trump wanted to stop the threat of any more violence in the US, he would say “outright” that President-elect Joe Biden won the 2020 election.
- “If he wants to de-escalate, he will stop these conspiracy theories, he will attempt to try to de-radicalize his supporters, and he will say that outright. I'm not holding my breath,” Crow added in an interview with CNN’s Kate Bolduan.
- Crow also said “we are on the right path” to making sure the inauguration will be secure on Jan. 20. “We're almost there,” he said.

- Robert Sanford was arrested on Thursday morning in Pennsylvania, according to the Justice Department.
- According to the documents, he's been charged on four counts in relation to the riots, including:
- The statement of facts state that Sanford was seen on video carrying a red object, which it states appears to be a fire extinguisher, as he stepped over a short wall. It says he hurls the red object towards police officers where it struck one officer who was wearing a helmet. It then ricochets and strikes another officer, without a helmet, before ricocheting again to strike a third officer in the head. That officer is also wearing a helmet, the statement said.
- It also quotes Officer William Young, who said he "felt a hard strike to the back of his helmet." He saw the fire extinguisher on the ground but didn't see who struck him, the statement said. Young was evaluated at the hospital and cleared to return to duty, the statement notes.

- Facebook will pause ads for "weapon accessories and protective equipment" ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, Buzzfeed News reported Saturday.
- Facebook's decision comes after recent reporting from Buzzfeed News' Ryan Mac and and Craig Silverman, employee complaints, and concerns from senators and attorneys general who wrote letters to the company.
- Buzzfeed News reported that this pause in the US will last at least until January 22, two days after the presidential inauguration.
- Facebook updated a press release that details what the social network is doing ahead of the upcoming inauguration today with this new action. It is also pausing political ads on the site and blocking events created at the White House and state capitol buildings for that day as a cautionary measure.
- "We will now also prohibit ads for accessories such as gun safes, vests and gun holsters in the US," Facebook wrote in the press release about the pause. Weapon-related ads are already banned on Facebook.
- There is heightened concern about political violence in DC, and in cities across the country, after pro-Trump supporters stormed Capitol Hill on January 6 in an effort to stop the certification of president-elect Joe Biden. Biden's inauguration rehearsal was recently postponed because of security threats, per Politico reporting.

- Buzzfeed News reported that these types of ads are shown in "News Feeds of people who had engaged with content about the attempted coup at the US Capitol building earlier this month," Mac and Silverman wrote.
- TTP Director Katie Paul told Buzzfeed News on January 13 that Facebook gets to profit these ads.
- "Facebook's advertising microtargeting is directing domestic extremists toward weapons accessories and armor that can make their militarized efforts more effective, all while Facebook profits," Paul told Buzzfeed News.
- Attorneys general also mentioned microtargeting in a letter sent to Will Castleberry for Facebook Public Policy on January 15. Karl Racine of DC, Kwame Raoul of Illinois, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, and Gurbir Grewal of New Jersey wrote the letter for Facebook to take "proactive steps" and take down these ads that might encourage violence ahead of the inauguration.
- The four attorneys general wrote that people who were part of the storming on Capitol Hill wore "military-style tactical gear."
- Their letter continued: "We believe that Facebook's microtargeted advertising of such gear, including to audiences that have an affinity for extremist content and election misinformation, could promote and facilitate further politically motivated attacks."
- Sens. Sherrod Brown, Tammy Duckworth, and Richard Blumenthal also wrote a letter on January 15 to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, requesting the company "hold itself accountable for how domestic enemies of the United States have used the company's products and platform to further their own illicit aims."
- According to the letter, available through Buzzfeed News, the senators wanted Zuckerberg to "take immediate action" to remove these advertisements after the riot at Capitol Hill.
- A number of companies and organizations have responded after the siege by suspending political contributions. Some corporations are suspending all political contributions at this time, while others are only suspending donations to the 147 Republican lawmakers who opposed the certification. Facebook is pausing all political donations for at least three months.

- Facebook announced that it will be temporarily banning some ads for gun accessories and body armor. It’s not enough
- On 16 January, Facebook announced that it will be “banning ads that promote weapon accessories and protective equipment in the US at least through January 22”. To those of us who have been observing the world of Trump-supporting social media, this announcement is a manipulative piece of whitewashing that obscures how Facebook’s algorithms continue to divide people the world over.
- As part of my research while working as a consulting producer on Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, I made many pro-Trump social media accounts. The accounts were a window into the Trump echo-chamber, where the unhinged threats and vitriol posted by radicalized users are chilling. Yet as shocking as the posts can be, they make perfect sense if you look at the ads that bombard those accounts.
- Roughly four out of five ads shown to my pro-Trump profiles sell tactical gear clearly intended for combat. This is not a new thing – it has been going on since I started looking at these accounts in June 2019, and it was probably going on much longer than that.
- Although Facebook policy does not allow the direct advertisement of guns and bombs, accessories have generally been fair game. Tactical backpacks with integrated back scabbards that can hold weapons up to 25in long. Rapid clip loaders. Night vision sights. Shoulder holsters. Body armor.
- Despite not actually selling guns, the vast majority of the ads nevertheless display military-style weapons somewhere in their design. An automatic rifle slides into the tactical backpack. The body armor is worn by someone actively poised to shoot a semi-automatic weapon. A black T-shirt presents an image of a medieval crusader in full armor holding a contemporary handgun, accompanied by a biblical quote: “Blessed be the lord my rock who trains my hands for war and my fingers for battle.”
- My pro-Trump feeds are personalized e-commerce sites for Capitol invaders. The rare ads that do not sell tactical gear and accessories for armed combat pitch survival and security products, from enhanced door locks to backup generators. But the fact that you can buy stuff by clicking the links doesn’t even matter. What matters is what being surrounded by those ads does to your mind.
- Being on Trump-facing Facebook takes me back to my cold war-era childhood in the early 1980s. I was fascinated by the magazine Soldier of Fortune, which was a window into the shady underworld of romantic mercenary fantasies. I had to wait to read copies my friends acquired. (My father, who survived the Holocaust, disapproved.)
- Soldier of Fortune’s pages focused on stories of mercenary life, combat tactics and – most exciting – a classified ads section for weapons and accessories, body armor, mail-order brides, and even hitmen. It was just a magazine, yet it was held responsible in US courts for contract murders and injuries resulting from the magazine’s classifieds.
- With some 190,000 subscribers at its peak, Soldier of Fortune was barely in the mainstream. It was not on every magazine stand. You had to go to Soldier of Fortune; it did not come to you. As such, Soldier of Fortune reached and radicalized a relative few.
- But today that universe seeks and surrounds you. When you first join Facebook you make a few choices of your own. But soon the algorithm starts narrowing your options and deciding what further choices to present to you. Because many of us rely on a limited number of news sources that populate our social media feeds, our information universe becomes more and more niche. For Trump supporters, that universe is often paramilitary.
- According to a 2018 Pew study, seven in 10 US adults are on Facebook, and about half of all Americans check the platform every day. Those who have liked and shared pro-Trump posts, or who have mostly pro-Trump friends, are being bombarded with fear- and aggression-driven advertising warning them to stockpile weapons and accessories. Most of the paths presented lead deeper into the rabbit hole. Few lead out.
- The problem we face as a society isn’t just fake news or political advertising. It is the math that drives the whole system. The platforms claim that their advertising algorithms give us what we want. That may be the case with the first few clicks or friends, but very quickly the algorithm is in control. Like the pied piper, it leads us into a land of extremes.
- The effect of being trapped is psychologically intense. A few months into maintaining my Trump online identities, I started feeling that I needed to buy guns. I knew it was irrational and impractical given my lack of training and urban lifestyle. Nonetheless I was convinced I needed them. When I told my girlfriend, her perplexed response made me realize how deeply my mind had been manipulated by my pro-Trump Facebook feeds.
- Facebook’s account bans have dominated the news lately, but its advertising algorithm has received far less scrutiny.
- Ad revenue is the lifeblood of platforms like Facebook and Twitter, and ads from companies peddling military-style gear are key to creating the hateful communities we see online today. To change the violent online world Facebook has created for “Trump’s Army” will require changing the algorithms themselves, the basic architecture of Facebook’s advertising – a market that is projected to bring the company nearly $100bn in the coming year.
- There are fixes, but they are not about banning things. Facebook already bans ads for weapons, ammunition and explosives. Extending the ban to tactical gear permanently just opens a can of worms. How do you decide what is tactical and what is not? It would be just another attempt to treat the symptom rather than cure the disease itself.
- Better than banning more things would be to revisit how the algorithm makes its suggestions, and come up with a solution that provides more avenues out of the rabbit hole than in. Tweaking algorithms so that they still serve up variety and diversity is just one idea. If they are going to monopolize people’s media consumption, they should have to serve up some common ground.
- But maybe we can be more ambitious and try to create tech that builds society. Can our algorithms privilege love over hate? Can we make equations that appeal to our humanity rather than preying on our fears?
- The Biden administration needs to establish a taskforce to tackle the issue. There is a long history of regulating the media in the public interest. If we let social media companies like Facebook continue to accelerate division, democracy is just going to bleed out.

- “We already prohibit ads for weapons, ammunition and weapon enhancements like silencers. But we will now also prohibit ads for accessories,” Facebook said in a blog post.
- Three U.S. senators sent a letter to Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Friday asking him to permanently block advertisements of products that are clearly designed to be used in armed combat.
- The senators, all Democrats, said the company must take this and other actions to “hold itself accountable for how domestic enemies of the United States have used the company’s products and platform to further their own illicit aims.”
- Facebook on Friday blocked the creation of any new Facebook events in close proximity to places such as the White House and U.S. Capitol in Washington, as well as state capitol buildings, through Jan. 20.
- The FBI has warned of armed protests being planned for Washington and all 50 state capitals in the run-up to the inauguration.
- Buzzfeed reported this week that Facebook has been running ads for military equipment next to content promoting election misinformation and news about the violence on Jan. 6.
- A Facebook company spokesperson said all the pages identified in the Buzzfeed story had been removed, and that the company was working with intelligence and terrorism experts and law enforcement.

- Facebook is temporarily banning advertisements for weapons accessories and protective gear amid the fallout from the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol and days before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.
- The platform said in a blog post that the ban will be in place at least two days after the inauguration, on Jan. 22, “out of an abundance of caution.”
- “We already prohibit ads for weapons, ammunition and weapon enhancements like silencers,” the company wrote. “But we will now also prohibit ads for accessories such as gun safes, vests and gun holsters in the US.”
- Facebook declined to comment to The Hill on the exact reasoning behind the ban.
- The move comes after Buzzfeed News reported last week that Facebook platform had been running ads for military equipment next to content promoting election misinformation and news about the Capitol riots.
- In addition, three senators and four attorneys general this week wrote letters to Facebook to demand that it permanently halt the advertisement of military goods and tactical gear, according to the outlet.
- “Facebook must hold itself accountable for how domestic enemies of the United States have used the company’s products and platform to further their own illicit aims,” Democratic Sens. Tammy Duckworth (Ill.) Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Sherrod Brown (Ohio) wrote.
- “Whether through negligence or with full knowledge, Facebook is placing profit ahead of our Nation’s democracy.”
- The social media company told Reuters that all the pages identified were removed, and that it was working with intelligence and law enforcement.
- The change is the latest in a series of actions taken to curb content that could incite violence after the attack at the U.S. Capitol that resulted in five deaths and dozens of arrests.
- Last Monday, the company announced that it was taking down content on its platform that contains the phrase “Stop the Steal,” and on Friday it blocked the creation of new Facebook events happening in “close proximity” to the White House, U.S. Capitol building and any state Capitol buildings.
- The company has also suspended President Trump’s pages until at least Inauguration Day.
- The FBI has issued a bulletin warning of armed protests at the U.S. Capitol and across all 50 state capitols leading up to the inauguration, and has warned police chiefs nationwide to be on “high alert.”
