- The US Consumer Finance Protection Board (CFSB) has ordered (pdf) two of the country’s largest employment background screening report providers to pay USD 13 million in penalties and refunds for providing inaccurate information.
- According to the CFSB, General Information Services (GIS) and its subsidiary e-Background-checks.com (BGC), which collectively generate and sell more than 10 million reports about job applicants every year, failed to employ reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information contained in reports provided to potential employers.
- In over 6,000 cases, the CFSB said, '(the firm) reported a criminal record that did not belong to the consumer, including, without limitation, those criminal records that (the firm) could not confirm belonged to the consumer based on personal identifiers…or reported inaccurate criminal record information about the consumer, including, without limitation, expunged records, dismissed charges, nolo prosequi records reported as convictions (the prosecutor declined to pursue the case), or records with incorrect disposition data.'
- GIS also failed to 'identify root causes of accuracy errors', failed to notice patterns of mistakes, and did not test the accuracy of non-disputed reports, the CFSB alleged.
- The two companies were required to pay a USD 2.5 million civil penalty, overhaul their compliance procedures, retain an independent consultant, and develop a comprehensive audit programme.

- General Information Services and Affiliate Failed to Verify the Accuracy of Consumer Reports Sold to Employers about Job Applicants
- WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) took action against two of the largest employment background screening report providers for failing take basic steps to assure the information reported about job applicants was accurate. The serious inaccuracies reported by General Information Services and its affiliate, e-Background-checks.com, Inc. (BGC), potentially affected consumers’ eligibility for employment and caused reputational harm. The CFPB is ordering the companies to correct their practices, provide $10.5 million in relief to harmed consumers, and pay a $2.5 million civil penalty.
- “General Information Services and its affiliate failed to take basic steps to provide accurate background screening reports to employers about job applicants,” said CFPB Director Richard Cordray. “Today, we are holding two of the largest companies in this market accountable for cleaning up the quality of their reports.”
- GIS and its affiliate, BGC, collectively generate and sell more than 10 million consumer reports about job applicants each year to prospective employers. These consumer reports include criminal history information and civil records, among other types of data. Employers use the consumer reports to determine hiring eligibility of applicants and make other types of employment decisions. The companies are two of the largest background screening report providers in the United States. GIS is headquartered in Chapin, S.C., and BGC is headquartered in Dallas, Texas.
- The CFPB found that GIS and BGC violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by, among other things, failing to employ reasonable procedures to assure the maximum possible accuracy of the information contained in reports provided to consumers’ potential employers. Specifically, the CFPB found that the companies violated the law by:
- Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the CFPB has the authority to take action against institutions or individuals engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices or who otherwise violate federal consumer financial laws. Under the terms of the CFPB order released today, the companies are required to:

- Two of the nation's largest employment background screening providers must pay $13 million after a federal agency found that inaccuracies in their reports may have cost applicants jobs or hurt their reputations.
- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered General Information Services, based in Chapin, S.C., and its affiliate, e-Background-checks.com, based in Dallas, to pay $10.5 million in relief to people harmed by the inaccuracies and $2.5 million in civil penalties.
- Each person affected should get about $1,000. The two companies collectively generate and sell more than 10 million background reports annually. The consent order involved 11,500 consumers who got background checks between July 21, 2011, and Dec. 31. 2014.
- According to the CFPB, the companies violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act when they failed to use basic procedures to match public records with the correct consumer and to audit reports to ensure their accuracy.
- Nearly 70 percent of criminal history disputes that consumers filed with General Information Services resulted in some change or correction to the information in their background report, the bureau found.
- "As a result, the companies provided prospective employers with inaccurate reports that included criminal records attached to the wrong consumers, dismissed and expunged records, and misdemeanors reported as felony convictions," the bureau said in a statement. "These inaccuracies can result in the denial of employment, missed economic opportunity, and reputational harm to otherwise qualified applicants."
- The companies also failed to prevent certain information from illegally being included in reports, such as non-reportable civil suit and civil judgment information older than seven years, the agency said.
- In a joint statement responding to the consent order, General Information Services and its affiliate said they believe they complied with the Fair Credit Reporting Act's requirement to use reasonable procedures to maximize accuracy. But they also "acknowledge that every background screening agency must engage in continuous improvement," and said they have agreed to the terms.
- The CFPB has ordered the two companies to identify consumers affected by their conduct. They must also retain an independent consultant to review their policies and staffing levels, develop an audit program and revise their processes to assure report accuracy, such as with algorithms that use middle names to distinguish between reports.

- Two of the US’ largest employment background check providers must pay $13.0 million for failing to ensure their background checks did not contain inaccuracies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced Thursday.
- Serious inaccuracies reported by General Information Services and its affiliate, backgroundchecks.com Inc. potentially affected consumers’ eligibility for employment and caused harm to their reputations, according to the agency.
- The $13.0 million includes $10.5 million in relief to consumers and a $2.5 million civil penalty.
- “General Information Services and its affiliate failed to take basic steps to provide accurate background screening reports to employers about job applicants,” Richard Cordray, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, said. “Today we are holding two of the largest companies in this market accountable for cleaning up the quality of their reports.”
- General Information Services and backgroundchecks.com sell more than 10 million reports on job applicants to employers each year. The reports include criminal history information and data from civil records. General Information Services is based in Chapin, SC, and has been in operation since 1966. And backgroundchecks.com is based in Dallas; it has been in operations since 1999.
- In a statement, the companies said: “Based on the companies’ analysis of the weaknesses alleged in the consent order and all governing law and regulatory guidance, the companies believe that they complied with the Fair Credit Reporting Act’s requirement to use reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy in creating background reports.”
- They continued: “Regardless, the companies remain committed to the highest achievable levels of accuracy in their reports and acknowledge that every background screening agency must engage in continuous improvement. Therefore, the companies take the bureau’s allegations very seriously and have agreed to the terms that the order imposes”
- Problems the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found include:
- Under terms of the agency’s order, the firms must pay $10.5 million in relief to consumers ($1,000 per consumer), pay a civil penalty of $2.5 million, revise their compliance procedures, retain an independent consultant to review their policies and procedures, and develop a comprehensive audit program.

- Before offering a prospective employee a job, many companies will first perform a background check. As with credit reports, any inaccuracies in these transcripts can affect an applicant’s eligibility for employment. To that end, federal regulators have ordered two of the country’s largest employment background screening report providers to pay $13 million in penalties and refunds for providing inaccurate information.
- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that General Information Services (GIS) and its affiliate, e-Background-checks.com, Inc. (BGC), will provide $10.5 million in relief to consumers who were negatively affected by the companies’ erroneous reporting.
- Employers routinely use these background reports – which include criminal history information and civil records – to determine hiring eligibility of applicants and make other types of employment decisions
- According to the CFPB consent order [PDF], GIS and BGC – which collectively generate and sell more than 10 million reports about job applicants each year – failed to employ reasonable procedures to ensure the accuracy of the information contained in reports provided to potential employers.
- The CFPB found that GIS did not require employers to provide consumers’ middle names, and neither company had a written policy for researching applicants with common names.
- As a result, the companies provided prospective employers with inaccurate reports that included criminal records attached to the wrong individuals, dismissed and expunged records, and misdemeanors reported as felony convictions.
- In fact, the CFPB found that between 2010 and 2014, nearly 70% of criminal history disputes filed with GIS resulted in some change or correction to the information in the consumer’s background report.
- Additionally, the Bureau found that GIS and BGC unlawfully included certain information in consumer reports they provided to prospective employers. Specifically, the CFPB found that GIS and BCG failed to take measures to prevent non-reportable civil suit and civil judgment information older than seven years from being illegally included in its reports.
- The CFPB claims that GIS and BGC’s actions likely resulted in the denial of employment, missed economic opportunity, and reputational harm to otherwise qualified applicants.
- Under the Bureau’s consent order, the two companies must pay $10.5 million in relief to harmed consumers.
- The companies must identify individuals who were negatively affected by their conduct and provide approximately $1,000 to each.
- GIS and BCG are also required to pay a $2.5 million civil penalty, revise their compliance procedures, retain an independent consultant, and develop a comprehensive audit program.

- It’s every job applicant’s nightmare. You are in the running for a new position, then an HR representative calls with bad news: You’ve failed a background check.  The firm thinks you have a criminal record! It’s a typical 21st Century database screw-up, but by the time you run down the error, the job is long gone. And you’re left wondering how many other opportunities were crushed by the data error. Thankfully there are other background check companies that employees might want to check out if they want to find out more about their potential employees, for example, something like this website among others might be a good alternative. Another example  could help with background check could be Clear Star – see more info at https://www.clearstar.net.
- On Thursday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleged that one of the nation’s largest employment background companies, General Information Services, put thousands of job applicants at risk of ordeals like that. The firm, which operates BackgroundChecks.com, sells more than 10 million employment background reports every year — but it did a poor job of preventing errors on its reports, the CFPB alleges.  In a consent order made public Thursday, the firm agreed to pay $10.5 million to injured consumers and pay a $2.5 million penalty.
- “General Information Services and its affiliate failed to take basic steps to provide accurate background screening reports to employers about job applicants,” said CFPB Director Richard Cordray.
- About 10,000 consumers disputed their General Information Services reports from 2011 to 2014 and uncovered errors, the CFPB says.
- In more than 6,000 cases, “(the firm) reported a criminal record that did not belong to the consumer, including, without limitation, those criminal records that (the firm) could not confirm belonged to the consumer based on personal identifiers…or reported inaccurate criminal record information about the consumer, including, without limitation, expunged records, dismissed charges, nolo prosequi records reported as convictions (the prosecutor declined to pursue the case), or records with incorrect disposition data,” the CFPB alleged.
- General Information Services had inadequate procedures for avoiding errors, the CFPB said.  It did not require employers to include middle names of job applicants, for example, which resulted in “mismatched criminal record information.”
- It also failed to “identify root causes of accuracy errors,” didn’t notice patterns of mistakes, and didn’t test the accuracy of non-disputed reports.
- In a statement on its website, General Information Services admitted no wrongdoing.
- “The Bureau alleged weaknesses in certain of the companies’ internal procedures for creating background reports. Based on the companies’ analysis of the weaknesses alleged in the consent order and all governing law and regulatory guidance, the companies believe that they complied with the Fair Credit Reporting Act’s requirement to use reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy in creating background reports,” it said. “Regardless, the companies remain committed to the highest achievable levels of accuracy in their reports and acknowledge that every background screening agency must engage in continuous improvement. Therefore, the companies take the Bureau’s allegations very seriously and have agreed to the terms that the order imposes.”
- The CFPB’s consent order offers one detailed example  of what it says were not “reasonable procedures” for preventing errors.
- “GIS tests two reports approximately every six weeks for each of its internal and external researchers. The process involves reassigning the two chosen reports to the same researcher to rerun the reports and confirm that the same records are returned. The procedures is not reasonable for several reasons. First, it tests only whether the records identified in a new search of potential matches are the same records identified in the original search — not whether the information included in the final report is lawful. Second, it fails to assess why certain non-reportable or mismatched information is included in reports. Third, testing two cases per researcher every six weeks is not based on any predictive algorithm or tested method.”

- Two of the largest employment background screening companies in the U.S. have been hit with a $13 million class action lawsuit for failing to ensure that they provided accurate information to employers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced Thursday that General Information Services and its affiliate backgroundchecks.com potentially violated consumers’ eligibility for employment and caused harm to their reputation, according to the agency. “General Information Services and its affiliate failed to take basic steps to provide accurate background screening reports to employers about job applicants”, said Richard Cordray, Director of the CFPB. Both companies sell more than 10 million reports on job applicants to employers each year, consisting of criminal history and civil records.
- General Information Systems issued a statement and held firm that they complied with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), based on the companies’ analysis of the weakness alleged in the consent order and all governing law and regulatory guidance. GIS believe that they complied with the Fair Credit Reporting Act’s requirement to use reasonable procedures to ensure maximum possible accuracy in creating background reports. There were two major violations that they CFPB found:
- Reporting public record information that didn’t belong to the subject of the report – General Information Services didn’t require the employer to provide a middle name of job applicants on the disclosure form; this resulted in records being reported with just a first and last name match. Additionally, it was found that between 2010 and 2014, nearly 70% of criminal records that were disputed by job applicants were found to be wrongly included in their background report and corrections needed to be made.Providing information outside of the appropriate reporting time – The companies failed to ensure that civil judgments they reported occurred within the last 7 years, pursuant to the FCRA requirements.
- The terms of the settlement are as follows:
- GIS agreed to pay $10.5 million in relief to consumers ($1,000.00 per consumer)Civil penalties of $2.5 millionGIS will revise their compliance proceduresGIS will retain an independent consultant to review their policies and procedures, and develop a comprehensive audit program.
- Workplace Violence
One out of every six crimes occurs in the workplace and homicide is the second leading cause of workplace death in the U.S.
- Education Falsification
National Credit Verification Service reports that 25% of the MBA degrees it verifies on resumes are false.
- Statistics
72% of shrinkage is due to employee theft.
34% of all job applications contain lies.
30% of small business failure is caused by employee theft.

- It isn’t uncommon for clients to push debt collection agencies to disqualify job candidates for criminal histories. Agencies may not be able to deliver on that demand much longer. Many states have already adopted a “ban the box” policy, which prohibits employers from asking about criminal convictions in job applications. (Check out our recent and thorough coverage on the risk in criminal background checks right here.) Now it appears that the Feds are following suit.
- President Obama appeared earlier this week in Newark, N.J. to announce a series of measures designed to help former criminals become productive and reenter society. In his comments, the President announced an executive order directing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to delay inquiries into criminal history until later in the hiring process. What’s more, the President also called on Congress to follow recent state law and pass legislation designed to “ban the box” on job applications.
- “We know that having millions of people in the criminal justice system, without any ability to find a job after release, is unsustainable,” President Obama said on Friday as part of his weekly address. “It’s bad for communities and it’s bad for our economy.”
- And when it comes to helping former convicts move back into society, “everyone has a role to play, from businesses that are hiring ex-offenders to philanthropies that are supporting education and training programs,” he added.
- If it were not already clear that Federal agencies plan to meet some of the most aggressive state laws and policies on criminal history and employment, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also gotten in on the action. Less than two weeks ago, the CFPB took action against two of the largest employment background screening report providers, General Information Services (GIS) and its affiliate, e-Background-checks.com, Inc. (BGC), for “failing to take basic steps to assure the information reported about job applicants was accurate.” The companies are now on the hook for $10.5 M in relief to consumers the agency identifies as having been harmed by the two background check companies.
- The agency alleges that GIS and BGC did not use basic procedures for matching public records to the correct individual and that the companies did not use an audit process to verify the accuracy of their reports. The agency also accuses the two companies of including impermissible information in reports, such as civil suit and civil judgment information older than seven years.
- insideARM perspective
- The signals are clear, and so is the risk to your firm. Agencies simply can’t rule out a candidate simply because he or she has a criminal record. As Radius Global Solutions HR VP Stacy Spradling explained here on insideARM recently, agencies have to take a more sophisticated, broader view of each candidate. A criminal history can’t be an automatic disqualifier, but rather one of many details hiring officers need to consider.
- “Considering a candidate’s criminal convictions over their skills and abilities may subject the employer to further scrutiny, ultimately compounding claims of discrimination,” she wrote. “To prevent risk an employer should know the regulations, ask questions about criminal backgrounds later in the process, and only disqualify candidates whose conviction strictly correlates to them being unsuccessful in the role.”

- When Michele Petry found out that she wouldn't be hired for a nursing job last March, she was shocked to find out why.
- The employment background report, conducted by Indianapolis-based IDE Management, revealed that Petry had multiple felonies including a felony conviction for drug paraphernalia and for theft on her record.
- The Booneville woman, who boasts a squeaky clean criminal record, insists the report is wrong. And after asking her prospective employer to see her background report, Petry was informed that she would not be hired.
- That led Petry to file a class action lawsuit against IDE Management in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, Evansville Division this week.
- She says the company, which does business as Cathedral Health Care Centers, denied her a job based on allegedly inaccurate results of a background check without giving her a proper chance to correct those results and thus violated required provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which governs background checks in the U.S.
- The issue of inaccurate employment screenings is wide-ranging when 93 percent of employers conduct criminal background checks on job applicants, according to a survey by the Society for Human Resource Management.
- And research conducted by the National Consumer Law Center states that criminal background screening companies routinely mismatch people, omit crucial information about a case, reveal sealed or expunged information, and/or misclassify offenses.
- In this case, Petry submitted to a background check with Indianapolis-based IDE Management, after applying for a position as a nurse with the company in March.
- She was called in for an interview, and was informed by IDE that it would extend an offer of employment if she passed a background screening, according to court documents.
- After receiving and reviewing the consumer report, obtained from an unknown consumer reporting agency, IDE decided not to hire Petry based on the report, court documents state.
- After the IDE told Petry they were not going to hire her, Petry asked why.
- "Defendant informed Plaintiff that the background report that it had obtained revealed multiple felonies including a felony conviction for drug paraphernalia and for theft." The problem was that Petry has not been convicted of any felonies.
- After requesting a copy of the report, and the company refused, Petry filed a lawsuit.
- As part of her claim, Petry says IDE negligently and willfully violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act when it failed to provide her with a copy of the report and a description in writing of the rights of Petry under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
- The Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are required to ensure that reporting companies obey the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which requires them to strive for accuracy.
- The law requires that these companies furnish reports drawn from public records for employment purposes to notify the people named in the reports in a timely manner, so any inaccuracies in the data can be challenged and that the public record is complete and up to date.
- There are cases in the past where the CFPB have fined consumer reporting agencies for reporting inaccurate information about job applicants.
- In 2015, the CFPB fined General Information Services and its affiliate, e-Background-checks.com Inc. when the the companies included civil suit and civil judgment information from more than seven years ago in reports they provided to prospective employers.
- The agency has ordered the companies to correct their practices, pay a $2.5 million civil penalty and $10.5 million in relief to they victims. The CFPB said the reports potentially harmed applicants' employment eligibility and reputations.
- And IDE is not the only company facing a class action lawsuit regarding inaccurate employment background reporting results.
- In January, Starbucks Corp. was faced with a class action lawsuit filed by a Colorado man who claims he was denied a job based on an allegedly inaccurate background check and is suing the coffeehouse chain for violations of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.
- David M. Marco, a Chicago attorney represents Petry. He told IndyStar that "the company is doing a very poor job of matching people."
- States are finding ways to cure the problems of inaccurate background screening results.
- This week, California's Fair Employment and Housing Council finalized new regulations that limit state employers' ability to use criminal history when making employment decisions.
- The regulations, borrowing heavily from the EEOC’s 2012 Guidance, will be effective July 1, 2017.
- The new regulations prohibit an employer from considering a job applicant’s or employee’s criminal history in making an employment decision if doing so would result in an adverse impact on individuals within a protected class, such as gender, race, and national origin.
- In order to succeed on a claim under these regulations, a job applicant must first prove that an employer’s background screening policy actually has an adverse impact on a protected class.
- A representative from IDE declined to comment.
