- Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has been running an 'advanced data analytics' and artificial intelligence (AI) pilot since 2018 to process temporary resident visa (TRVs) applications submitted from China and India. The system was extended to TRV applications submitted from all countries outside Canada in January 2022.
- Visa applications are assessed on the basis of eligibility and admissibility. For straightforward applications, eligibility is approved solely by the model, while eligibility for more complex applications is decided upon by an immigration officer. All applications are reviewed by an immigration officer for admissibility.
- A September 2018 report (pdf) by University of Toronto's Citizen Lab concluded the IRCC's pilot threatens to violate domestic and international human rights law in the form of bias, discrimination, privacy breaches, due process, and procedural fairness.
- The report cautions that experimenting with these technologies in the immigration and refugee system amounts to a 'high-risk laboratory,' as many of these applications come from some of the world’s most vulnerable people, including those fleeing persecution and war zones.
- Citizen Lab called on the national authorities to freeze the development of AI-based systems until a government standard and oversight bodies are established.
- In January 2022, the IRCC published an algorithmic impact assessment (AIA) of its temporary resident visa application assessment system, concluding that the impact level of the system is moderate.
- However, the assessment has been described as 'noticeably short and trite in detail', noticeably regarding how its scoring system works, the identity and degree of involvement of external stakeholders, and transparency.
- The IRCC's TRV application assessment system has been shrouded in secrecy since its inception.
- During the Citizen Lab report’s research phase, 27 distinct official information requests were submitted to the Government of Canada. Every one of them remained unanswered.
- And while the publication of the IRCC's algorithmic impact assessment provided further information about the system, many questions were limited to 'yes' or 'no' answers.

- Ottawa, January 24, 2022—Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is creating new efficiencies in its temporary resident visa (TRV) application process by expanding the use of advanced data analytics, which will now help IRCC officers sort and process all TRV applications submitted from outside Canada. IRCC officers will continue to make the final decision on all applications, and only an IRCC officer can refuse an application. The system never refuses or recommends refusing applications.
- The use of advanced data analytics is part of IRCC’s commitment to finding new ways to improve our client service and processes. It is expected to assist in managing IRCC’s increasing volume of TRV applications. The analytics system helps to accelerate IRCC’s work by identifying routine applications for streamlined processing, such as those from certain clients who have been previously approved to visit Canada in the past 10 years. It can also create efficiencies by sorting and triaging non-routine applications to officers based on their level of complexity. When the advanced data analytics system finds a routine application, it can determine that an applicant is eligible, but will never refuse an application. It will always send the file to an officer to determine if the applicant is admissible to Canada and make the final decision.
- At IRCC, advanced data analytics has been used since 2018 to help sort and process more than 1 million TRV applications from countries where there is a high volume of applications. During this time, it has been shown that routine files can be assessed 87% faster using the system. This results in some applicants receiving decisions more quickly. In addition, the technology assumes a significant portion of clerical and repetitive tasks related to sorting applications, which allows IRCC officers to focus their attention on assessing applications and making final decisions.
- IRCC is working to responsibly develop and deploy data-driven technologies in line with all privacy requirements. As part of our compliance with Canada’s Treasury Board Directive on Automated Decision-Making, an algorithmic impact assessment (AIA) has been completed to assess the analytical models used for TRV applications. The AIA categorized the impact level of the system as moderate, and numerous measures are in place to mitigate possible risk. These measures include an extensive review process for potential discriminatory impacts, privacy and security elements built into the design of the system, and the ability of officers to overturn an eligibility determination.

- As more people apply for IRCC programs, we’re introducing technologies to help us process applications more efficiently. We use technology to support, assist and inform IRCC decision makers, not to replace them. Our employees remain central to IRCC’s decision-making processes. We’re automating certain tasks and activities, such as using systems to sort applications, so our employees and decision makers can spend more time on complex applications and issues, and on making final decisions.
- IRCC is using advanced data analytics to sort and help process temporary resident visa applications submitted from outside Canada. We have also started a pilot using this technology to help process spousal and common-law partner sponsorship applications that are submitted in Canada. Advanced data analytics systems recognize patterns to help accelerate our work and better inform decision makers.
- Advanced data analytics allows officers to identify routine applications for streamlined processing, for example, those from certain clients who have been previously approved to visit Canada in the past 10 years. This process allows us to better manage our work and ultimately helps some clients to receive their decision sooner.
- When an application is deemed routine for streamlined processing, advanced data analytics is used to determine only that an applicant is eligible, before the file is sent to an officer to screen for admissibility, which includes security and criminality. Applications not deemed routine are triaged to officers for regular manual processing. Officers always make the final decision on applications.
- The systems never refuse or recommend refusing applications. When applications are refused, an officer made the decision.
- IRCC officers
- The systems are reviewed routinely to make sure they’re working as intended and the results are consistent with applications that receive a full human review. We’re carefully checking how advanced data analytics performs before we expand its use in other areas.
- Before we explore any technology to support one of our services, we assess the needs specific to that service, including the benefits for (and impact on) clients.
- A team of experts, including decision makers, will continue to be involved throughout the process of developing and using future advanced data analytics systems at IRCC, including careful review for bias and discriminatory impacts.
- Changes to existing systems only happen with human oversight, testing and approval.
- IRCC is working to be a leader in the responsible use of data-driven technologies. We have developed our approach to align with the Directive on Automated Decision-Making.
- We used information collected from the applications of past clients to design the advanced data analytics systems now in use. Other IRCC systems will be designed in the same way.
- If you’re applying now, or have applied to an IRCC program in the past, the information in your application, and other information collected in support of your application, may be used by IRCC to design an advanced data analytics system within IRCC. The personal information that IRCC collects is reflected in InfoSource.
- IRCC may use these analytics systems to support processing applications and decision-making in accordance with the Privacy Act, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
- Our advanced data analytics systems only use the personal information that is relevant and needed for the application process, including information provided by our law enforcement partners in accordance with formal information-sharing agreements. For example, our systems do not use information from social media channels.
- IRCC conducts privacy impact assessments when developing advanced data analytics systems.
- Privacy will remain a central priority as we expand the use of advanced data analytics. IRCC continues to take its privacy obligations regarding personal information seriously and continues to follow and respect Canada’s Privacy Act and related directives and policies.

URL: https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/bots-at-the-gate-human-rights-analysis-automated-decision-making-in-canadas-immigration-refugee-system/
- A new report from the Citizen Lab and the International Human Rights Program at the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Law investigates the use of artificial intelligence and automated decision-making in Canada’s immigration and refugee systems. The report finds that use of automated decision-making technologies to augment or replace human judgment threatens to violate domestic and international human rights law, with alarming implications for the fundamental human rights of those subjected to these technologies.
- The ramifications of using automated decision-making in the sphere of immigration and refugee law and policy are far-reaching. Marginalized and under-resourced communities such as residents without citizenship status often have access to less robust human rights protections and less legal expertise with which to defend those rights. The report notes that adopting these autonomous decision-making systems without first ensuring responsible best practices and building in human rights principles at the outset may only exacerbate pre-existing disparities and can lead to rights violations including unjust deportation.
- Since at least 2014, Canada has been introducing automated decision-making experiments in its immigration mechanisms, most notably to automate certain activities currently conducted by immigration officials and to support the evaluation of some immigrant and visitor applications. Recent announcements signal an expansion of the uses of these technologies in a variety of immigration decisions that are normally made by a human immigration official. These can include decisions on a spectrum of complexity, including whether an application is complete, whether a marriage is “genuine”, or whether someone should be designated as a “risk.”
- The report provides a critical interdisciplinary analysis of public statements, records, policies, and drafts by relevant departments within the Government of Canada, including Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. The report additionally provides a comparative analysis to similar initiatives occurring in similar jurisdictions such as Australia and the United Kingdom. In February, the IHRP and the Citizen Lab submitted 27 separate Access to Information Requests and continue to await responses from Canada’s government.
- The report concludes with a series of specific recommendations for the federal government, the complete and detailed list of which are available at the end of this publication. In summary, they include recommendations that the federal government:
- 1. Publish a complete and detailed report, to be maintained on an ongoing basis, of all automated decision systems currently in use within Canada’s immigration and refugee system, including detailed and specific information about each system.
- 2. Freeze all efforts to procure, develop, or adopt any new automated decision system technology until existing systems fully comply with a government-wide Standard or Directive governing the responsible use of these technologies.
- 3. Adopt a binding, government-wide Standard or Directive for the use of automated decision systems, which should apply to all new automated decision systems as well as those currently in use by the federal government.
- 4. Establish an independent, arms-length body with the power to engage in all aspects of oversight and review of all use of automated decision systems by the federal government.
- 5. Create a rational, transparent, and public methodology for determining the types of administrative processes and systems which are appropriate for the experimental use of automated decision system technologies, and which are not.
- 6. Commit to making complete source code for all federal government automated decision systems—regardless of whether they are developed internally or by the private sector—public and open source by default, subject only to limited exceptions for reasons of privacy and national security.
- 7. Launch a federal Task Force that brings key government stakeholders alongside academia and civil society to better understand the current and prospective impacts of automated decision system technologies on human rights and the public interest more broadly.

- This article was published more than 4 years ago. Some information may no longer be current.
- The Canadian government’s proposed use of artificial intelligence to assess refugee claims and immigration applications could jeopardize applicants' human rights, says a group of privacy experts.
- The warnings are raised in a new report from the Citizen Lab, a group of civic-minded technological and privacy policy researchers at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, and the University of Toronto Faculty of Law’s International Human Rights Program.
- The federal government is already taking steps to make use of artificial intelligence. In May, The Globe and Mail reported that Justice Canada and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) were piloting an artificial-intelligence program to assist with preremoval risk assessments and immigration applications on humanitarian grounds.
- The report being released Wednesday cautions that experimenting with these technologies in the immigration and refugee system amounts to a “high-risk laboratory,” as many of these applications come from some of the world’s most vulnerable people, including those fleeing persecution and war zones. Artificial intelligence could be used, according to the analysis, to assess an applicant’s risk factor, predict the likelihood that an application is fraudulent, gauge whether a marriage is genuine or whether children are biological offspring.
- Citizen Lab is calling on Ottawa to freeze development of all artificial intelligence-based systems until a government standard and oversight bodies have been established.
- Canada processed more than 50,000 refugee claims in 2017, and projects it will admit 310,000 new permanent residents in 2018. Canada also processes millions of work, study, and travel applications each year as part of an array of immigration and visa programs.
- “IRCC is committed to implementing this type of technology in a responsible manner and working collaboratively with the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat,” spokeswoman Nancy Caron said in an e-mailed statement. “IRCC is exploring tools that can support case law and legal research, facilitate trend analysis in litigation, predict litigation outcomes, and help develop legal advice and assessments."
- Ottawa has recognized that government branches will need guidance when undertaking artificial-intelligence projects. The Treasury Board is currently developing a federal standard for automated decision-making systems, and recently published a draft “algorithmic impact assessment,” which will help departments grapple with the expected and unexpected implications of algorithmic systems.
- In procurement documents, IRCC stated it hoped the system could help assess the “merits” of an immigrant or refugee’s application before a final decision is rendered.
- “AI is not neutral. If the recipe of your algorithm is biased, the results in the decision are also going to be biased,” said Petra Molnar, an immigration lawyer with the International Human Rights Program and co-author of the report.
- These biases have sometimes become painfully evident. In 2015, Google’s photo-tagging algorithm suggested the label “gorilla” when presented with an image of a black person. To fix the problem, Google eventually removed “gorilla” from the list of possible labels.
- Prejudiced algorithms are making their way into essential civic processes, too: In 2016, the U.S. publication ProPublica revealed that COMPAS, a risk-assessment algorithm used in sentencing and parole determinations in Florida, was biased against black people.
- “We’re heartened by the fact that the government is thinking through the use of these technologies," Ms. Molnar said, "but what we want to do is bring everyone to the table and look at it from a human-rights lens as the starting point.”

- A new report is warning about the federal government's interest in using artificial intelligence to screen and process immigrant files, saying it could create discrimination, as well as privacy and human rights breaches.
- The research, conducted by the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab outlines the impacts of automated decision-making involving immigration applications and how errors and assumptions within the technology could lead to "life-and-death ramifications" for immigrants and refugees.
- The authors of the report issue a list of seven recommendations calling for greater transparency and public reporting and oversight on government's use of artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to automate certain activities involving immigrant and visitor applications.
- "We know that the government is experimenting with the use of these technologies ... but it's clear that without appropriate safeguards and oversight mechanisms, using A.I. in immigration and refugee determinations is very risky because the impact on people's lives are quite real," said Petra Molnar, one of the authors of the report.
- "A.I. is not neutral. It's kind of like a recipe and if your recipe is biased, the decision that the algorithm will make is also biased and difficult to challenge."
- Earlier this year, federal officials launched two pilot projects to have an A.I. system sort through temporary resident visa applications from China and India. Mathieu Genest, a spokesman for Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen, says the analytics program helps officers triage online visa applications to "process routine cases more efficiently."
- He says the technology is being used exclusively as a "sorting mechanism" to help immigration officers deal with an ever-growing number of visitor visas from these countries by quickly identifying standard applications and flagging more complex files for review.
- 
- Immigration officers always make final decisions about whether to deny a visa, Genest says.
- But this isn't the only dive into artificial intelligence being spearheaded by the Immigration Department.
- In April, the department started gauging interest from the private sector in developing other pilot projects involving A.I., or "machine learning," for certain areas of immigration law, including in humanitarian and compassionate applications, as well as pre-removal risk assessments.
- These two refugee streams of Canada's immigration system are often used as a last resort by vulnerable people fleeing violence and war to remain in Canada, the Citizen Lab report notes.
- "Because immigration law is discretionary, this group is really the last group that should be subject to technological experiments without oversight," Molnar says.
- She notes that A.I. has a "problematic track record" when it comes to gender and race, specifically in predictive policing that has seen certain groups over-policed.
- "What we are worried about is these types of biases are going to be imported into this high risk laboratory of immigration decision-making."
- The government says officials are only interested developing or acquiring a tool to help Immigration and Justice Department officials manage litigation and develop legal advice in immigration law.
- "The intent is to support decision makers in their work and not replace them," Genest said.
- "We are monitoring and assessing the results and success of these pilots before we launch or consider expanding it to other countries and lines of business."
- In April, Treasury Board released a white paper on "responsible artificial intelligence in the government of Canada," and is currently consulting with stakeholders to develop a draft directive on the use of automated decision-making technologies within government.
- Molnar says she hopes officials will consider the Citizenship Lab's research and recommendations, including their call for an independent, arms-length oversight body to monitor and review the use of A.I. decision-making systems.
- "We are beyond the conversation whether or not A.I. is being used. The question is, if A.I. is here to stay we want to make sure it is done right."

- Un rapport indépendant, mené par le Citizen Lab de l’Université de Toronto, met en garde le gouvernement canadien en raison de son utilisation d’une nouvelle génération de logiciels intelligents pour filtrer et traiter les dossiers de personnes qui font des demandes pour immigrer au Canada.
- Pétra Molnar du Citizen Lab – Photo : Université de Toronto
- Le Citizen Lab estime que les risques de dérapages aux conséquences très graves naîtraient d’une utilisation insensible ou abusive en plus de mener à de la discrimination, à l’atteinte à la vie privée et aux droits de la personne des candidats à l’immigration.
- Ces nouveaux outils dits intelligents pourraient, dit-on, entraîner des « conséquences mortelles » pour les immigrants et les réfugiés.
- « Nous savons que le gouvernement expérimente l’utilisation de ces technologies […] mais il est clair que sans garanties et mécanismes de surveillance appropriés, utiliser l’IA pour déterminer l’immigration et le statut de réfugié est très risqué », explique Pétra Molnar, l’une des auteures du rapport.
- « L’IA n’est pas neutre. C’est un peu comme une recette. Et si votre recette est biaisée, la décision prise par l’algorithme est également biaisée et difficile à contester », poursuit-elle.
- Un outil qui aide au triage, affirme-t-on au gouvernement, mais qui ne prend pas les décisions

- Au début de l’année, des fonctionnaires fédéraux ont lancé deux projets pilotes pour qu’un système d’intelligence artificielle trie des demandes de visa de résident temporaire en provenance de la Chine et de l’Inde.
- Mathieu Genest, un porte-parole du ministre de l’Immigration Ahmed Hussen, a déclaré que le programme d’analyse aide les agents à trier les demandes de visas en ligne pour « traiter plus efficacement les dossiers courants ».
- Il dit que la technologie est utilisée exclusivement comme un mécanisme de tri pour aider les agents d’immigration à traiter un nombre toujours croissant de demandes de visas de visiteurs de ces pays en déterminant rapidement les applications normales et en signalant les dossiers plus complexes à examiner.
- « L’intention est de soutenir les décideurs dans leur travail et non de les remplacer, a dit M. Genest. Nous surveillons et évaluons les résultats et le succès de ces projets pilotes avant de les lancer ou d’envisager de les étendre à d’autres pays et secteurs d’activité. »

- Quoi faire pour éviter les pièges de l’intelligence artificielle en immigration?
- Les auteurs du rapport du Citizen Lab publient une liste de sept recommandations pour une plus grande transparence, la publication et la surveillance publiques de l’utilisation de l’intelligence artificielle et l’analyse prédictive par le gouvernement pour automatiser certaines activités qui visent des applications d’immigrants et de visiteurs.
- Ils s’inquiètent particulièrement du sort des réfugiés dans les mains de l’intelligence artificielle. Puisque la loi sur l’immigration est discrétionnaire, ce groupe devrait vraiment être le dernier groupe soumis à des expériences technologiques sans surveillance.
- Le Citizen Lab se dit en faveur de la création d’un organisme de surveillance indépendant chargé de surveiller et d’examiner l’utilisation de l’intelligence artificielle pour la prise de décision.

- Wanted: A contractor to help immigration officials use algorithms and data-mining to assess the personal risks of sending a failed refugee claimant home and to calculate if a migrant is well-established enough to stay in Canada on humanitarian grounds.
- This is not a fictional ad but a tender notice recently issued by Ottawa to explore the potential use of artificial intelligence and data analytics in Canada’s immigration and refugee system.
- According to a new University of Toronto study, the job ad is just the latest example of government replacing human decision-making with machines — a trend it says is creating “a laboratory for high-risk experiments” that threaten migrants’ human rights and should alarm all Canadians.
- “The nuanced and complex nature of many refugee and immigration claims may be lost on these technologies, leading to serious breaches of internationally and domestically protected human rights, in the form of bias, discrimination, privacy breaches, due process and procedural fairness issues,” warned the 88-page report being released Wednesday by U of T’s International Human Rights Program and Citizen Lab.
- “These systems will have life-and-death ramifications for ordinary people, many of whom are fleeing for their lives.”
- Concerned about the human impact of automated systems, researchers dug into public records such as public statements, policies and media reports of the federal government’s adoption of the technologies in the immigration system. More than 30 experts were consulted, including computer scientists, technologists, lawyers, advocates and academics from Canada, the U.S, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and Brazil.
- Researchers have also submitted 27 separate access to information requests to eight different government departments and agencies, but have yet to receive any data or response.
- Study co-author Petra Molnar said Canada has used automated decision-making tools since at least 2014 to “triage” immigration and visa applications into simple cases and complex ones that require further review by officers due to red flags the machines were trained to look for.
- “Algorithms are by no means neutral or objective. It’s a set of instructions and recipes based on previous data analyses that you use to teach the machine to make a decision. It doesn’t think or understand the decision it makes. It’s a rubber-stamping process,” explained Molnar, a research associate with the International Human Rights Program.
- “Biases of the individuals designing an automated system or selecting the data that trains it can result in discriminatory outcomes that are difficult to challenge because they are opaque.”
- The study, for instance, looked at an algorithm used in some U.S. courts to assess the risk of reoffending when ordering pretrial detention and found racialized and vulnerable people were more likely to be held behind bars than white offenders.
- Cynthia Khoo of the Citizen Lab said the increasing use of artificial intelligence or algorithmic decision-making tools speaks to the broader trend of “technosolutionism” that assumes technology is a panacea to human frailties and errors.
- “The problem, however, is that technology — which is made and designed by humans and trained on human decisions and human-produced data — comes with these exact same problems, but wrapped up in a more scientific-looking box, and with the additional problem that not everyone realizes those problems remain,” said Khoo.
- The report recommends Ottawa establish an independent, arms-length oversight body to review all uses of automated decision systems by the federal government. It also wants Ottawa to publish all its current and future uses of artificial intelligence and create a task force to better understand the current and prospective impacts of these technologies.

- The Canadian government’s use of artificial intelligence for decision-making in areas such as immigration needs independent oversight and carefully developed standards of use, says a new report from the University of Toronto.
- The Canadian government’s use of artificial intelligence for decision-making in areas such as immigration needs independent oversight and carefully developed standards of use, says a new report from the University of Toronto.
- U of T’s International Human Rights Program at the Faculty of Law, along with the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, has released “Bots at the Gate: A Human Rights Analysis of Automated Decision-Making in Canada’s Immigration and Refugee System,” which says the federal government has been using algorithms and other AI technology since 2014, turning immigrants and refugee claimants into lab rats for the new technology.
- “Without appropriate safeguards and oversight, the use of AI is very risky,” says Petra Molnar, a researcher at U of T’s law faculty’s IHRP. “The impact on lives is very real because we're dealing with a population that doesn't have access to the same types of rights that others have.
- “This is the last group that should be subject to technological experiments of this nature,” says Molnar, whose training is in refugee and immigration law.
- The report recommends independent oversight of all automated decision-making by the federal government, publication of all uses of AI for any purpose and the establishment of a task force composed of “government, civil society and academia."
- The government has algorithmically automated certain duties formerly done by immigration officers, such as evaluating immigrant and visitor applications. It has indicated plans to expand this technology including evaluating the legitimacy of a marriage, whether an application is complete, whether a person should be protected as a refugee or if an applicant is a security risk.
- Molnar says Charter rights to freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of mobility, privacy, equality and freedom from discrimination are at stake given the use of this technology.
- AI already has a “problematic track record” on race and gender, exemplified in predictive policing, she says.
- “As a society, we are really excited about the use of these technologies. But we need to remember that AI is not neutral. It's essentially like a recipe, right? It depends what you put in it,” Molnar says.
- “And just like a human decision-maker, an algorithm will hold its own biases and replicate them throughout the system.”
- Cynthia Khoo, a digital rights lawyer and fellow at the Citizen Lab, refers to a 2014 case in the U.K. where 7,000 foreign students were wrongfully deported because an automated voice analysis system proved unreliable.
- Khoo says automated decision-making by the federal government raises serious questions about what happens with personal information.
- “In addition, wherever you have people's personal data being used, whether fed into an algorithm for training or used as an input to get a recommendation about you, that raises a privacy rights question — what happens to your data, who is it given to and how are they using, protecting or sharing it, and why?” Khoo said via email.
- The report was developed using interviews with government analysts, policies, records and public statements made by the government and information requests. The researchers are waiting on responses to 27 access to information requests, filed in April of this year.
- The “limited” information the researchers obtained from government is “part of the problem” and led to their recommendation for greater transparency, says Khoo.
- The researchers held a workshop with 30 experts at the Citizen Lab. Molnar says the report is different form the work the lab usually does because it is an attempt to canvas possible human rights violations before they occur.
- “The question isn't are we going to be using AI but more, if we are using it, how are we going to ensure that it's done right in an accountable kind of framework of oversight, to make sure that the human rights ramifications are accounted for and make sure that we use these technologies critically and carefully,” says Molnar.
- The report's authors have planned meetings with several federal departments including the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, Innovation, Science and Economic Development and the Treasury Board Secretariat.
- Ian Stedman, a lawyer and PhD candidate at Osgoode Hall Law School, led a conference in February called Bracing for Impact: the Artificial Intelligence Challenge, to look at the implications of AI technology on industry, intellectual property, cybersecurity, accountability and society at large. Frequently referenced at the conference was the idea of automated decision-making within the public sector. The use of the technology in the immigration system is “shocking” to Stedman, saying he thought government was further behind, still devising assessment tools to determine if these practices “do more harm than good.”
- “One of the call to arms that came up in the conference was that we can't just go into this blind, there has to be a lot of work going into these topics before we really start deploying AI to make decisions about humans that, you know, impact people's personal lives," he says.
- Last year, the Canadian government announced a $125-million “artificial intelligence strategy,” which the finance department said would “position Canada as a world-leading destination for companies seeking to invest in AI and innovation.”
- “It’s an interesting time because Canada is presenting itself and has been presenting itself, rightly so, as a leader in human rights, but it's also now presenting itself as a leader in AI,” Molnar says. “So it has this really unique and beautiful opportunity to be a leader in the responsible use of AI with human rights at the centre.”

- Top university report says the Canadian government could be violating human rights in its approach to testing artificial intelligence.
- Shutterstock
- The use of AI for decision-making in areas such as immigration requires independent oversight and to have carefully developed standards of use, warns a new report from the University of Toronto.
- ‘lab rats’
- The University’s international human rights program at the faculty of law has teamed up with the citizen lab at the Munk school of global affairs to present ‘Bots at the Gate: A Human Rights Analysis of Automated Decision-Making in Canada’s Immigration and Refugee System.’ The report is aimed at the Canadian government, which last year launched a $125-million ‘artificial intelligence strategy’ with the ambition to ‘position Canada as a world-leading destination for companies seeking to invest in AI and innovation.’ The authors state the federal government has been using algorithms and other AI technology since 2014, turning immigrants and refugee claimants into ‘lab rats’ for the new technology. Certain duties, formerly undertaken by immigration officers, have been algorithmically automated, including the evaluation of immigrant and visitor applications. The government has intimated  it will expand this technology to areas such as evaluating the legitimacy of a marriage, judging completeness of an application, whether a person merits refugee protection, and security risk assessments of applicants.
- Human rights concerns
- The report recommends independent oversight of all automated decision-making by the federal government, publication of all uses of AI for any purpose and the establishment of a task force composed of government, civil society and academia. The authors are worried the use of AI technology is creating problems in relation to human rights such as freedom of expression, religion, mobility and discrimination, as well raising privacy and equality concerns. The report was developed using interviews with government analysts, policies, records and public statements made by the government and information requests. Additionally, the researchers await responses to 27 access to information requests filed last April. Further meetings are planned by the report’s authors with several federal departments.

- The federal government is moving ahead with machine-assisted decision-making.
- If there was ever any doubt the federal government would use automation to help it make its administrative decisions, Budget 2022 has put that to rest. In it, Ottawa pledges to change the Citizenship Act to allow for the automated and machine-assisted processing of a growing number of immigration-related applications.
- In truth, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has been looking at analytics systems to automate its activities and help it assess immigrant applications for close to a decade. The government also telegraphed its intention back in 2019, when it issued a Directive on Automated Decision-Making (DADM), which aims to build safeguards and transparency around its use.
- "[T]he reference to enable automated and machine-assisted processing for citizenship applications is mentioned in the budget to ensure that in the future, IRCC will have the authority to proceed with our ambition to create a more integrated, modernized and centralized working environment." said Aidan Stickland, spokesperson for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship minister Sean Fraser, in an emailed reply.
- "This would enable us to streamline the application process for citizenship with the introduction of e-applications in order to help speed up application processing globally and reduce backlogs," Stickland, added. "Details are currently being formalized."
- But to live a life of ambition requires taking risks. So the DADM comes with an algorithmic impact assessment tool. According to Teresa Scassa, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, it creates obligations for any government department or agency that plans to adopt automated decision-making, either in whole or as a system that makes recommendations. It is a risk-based framework to determine the obligation to be placed on the department or agency.
- "The citizenship and immigration context is one where what they're looking at is that external client," Scassa says. "It does create this governance framework for those types of projects."
- Scassa says that the higher the risk of impact on a person's rights, or the environment, the more obligations are placed on the department or agency using it, such as requirements for peer review, monitoring outputs to ensure the system remains consistent with the objectives or that it doesn't demonstrate improper bias.
- "It governs things like what kind of notice should be given," Scassa says. "If it's very low-risk, it might be a very general notice, like something on a web page. If it's high risk, it will be a specific notice to the individual that automated decision-making is in use. Depending on where the project is in the risk framework, there is a sliding scale of obligations to ensure that individuals are protected from adverse impacts."
- Scassa suspects that IRCC may use automated decision-making to determine if someone qualifies for citizenship, which can mean different things.
- It could be a triage system, for example, drawing information from applications before using AI to determine which applicants clearly qualify for citizenship. "Everything else [would fall] into a different basket where it needs to be reviewed by an officer," Scassa says.
- Such a system would be relatively low-risk as any decisions would be positive for the applicant, while all others go to a human for review, which would speed up overall processing times.
- "That may be less problematic than a system that makes all of the decisions, and people have to figure out why they got rejected, and you have to ask how transparent is the algorithm, and what are your rights to have the decision reviewed," Scassa adds. "There is the question of how it will be designed, and how impactful the AI tool will be on individuals. On the other hand, a triage system like this could have automation bias where files get flagged. Maybe the human reviewing them approaches them with a particular mindset because they haven't been considered to be automatically accepted. The automation bias may make the human less likely to approve them."
- Scassa notes that the Open Government platform shows an algorithmic impact assessment for a tool developed for spousal analytics, a form of triage tool, which gives a sense of what kinds of tools the department is contemplating.
- Scassa also notes that under the Citizenship Act, a provision allows for the delegation of the minister's powers to any person authorized in writing. She suspects that the proposed legislative change could be to specifically allow some of the decisions to be made on a fully-automated basis.
- When it comes to reviewing decisions, the DADM and its risk framework appears to apply administrative law principles, including procedural fairness protections.
- Paul Daly, also a law professor at the University of Ottawa, adds that the administrative law principles apply regardless of whether this type of automated decision-making has been authorized in the statute.
- "It's a common concern for officials using sophisticated machine-learning technology to want legal authority," Daly says. "Really, that's only one part of the picture. There's a whole body of legal principles from administrative law, the Charter, and the [DADM] that have to be complied with when you start to actually use the systems," Daly says.
- Lex Gill, a fellow at Citizen Lab, co-authored a report called "Bots at the Gate," which looks at the human rights impacts of automated decision-making in Canada's citizenship and immigration system. She acknowledges there are serious backlogs within the immigration system. But she cautions that faster isn't always better, particularly when the error rates associated with AI disproportionately affect certain groups who are already treated unfairly.
- "Sometimes we adopt technologies that will allow us to believe that we are doing something more scientific, methodical or fair, when really what we are doing is reproducing the status quo, but faster and with less transparency," Gill says. "That is always my concern when we talk about automating these kinds of administrative processes."
- Gill notes there is a spectrum of technologies available for automated and machine-assisted processing, some of which are not problematic, while others are worrying and raise human rights issues. Still, it is hard to know what we may be dealing with without more information from the minister.
- "When we talk about using automated or machine-assisted technology to do things like risk scoring, that's an area where we know that it's highly discretionary," Gill says. "There is an entire universe of academic study that demonstrates that those technologies tend to replicate existing forms of bias and discrimination and profiling that already exists within administrative systems."
- Gill says that these systems tend to learn from existing practices. The result tends to exacerbate discriminatory outcomes and makes them more difficult to challenge because there is the additional layer of perceived scientific or technical neutrality layered on top of a system that demonstrated bias.
- "When the government is imagining adopting these kinds of technologies, is it imagining doing that in a way that is enhancing transparency, accountability, and reviewability of decisions?" asks Gill. "Efficiency is clearly an important goal, but the rule of law, accountability and control of administrative discretion also require friction—they require a certain degree of scrutiny, the ability to slow things down, the ability to review things, and the ability to understand why and how a decision was made."
- Gill says that unless these new technologies come with oversight, review and transparency mechanisms, she worries that they will take a system that is already discretionary, opaque, and has the ability to change the direction of a person's life, and render it even more so.
- "If you're going to start adopting these kinds of technologies, you need to do it in a way that maximally protects a person's Charter rights, and which honours the seriousness of the decisions at stake," Gill says. "Don't start with decisions that engage the liberty interests of a person. Start with things like whether or not this student visa application is missing a supporting document."
