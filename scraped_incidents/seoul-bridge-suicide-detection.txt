- SEOUL, June 30 (Reuters) - Is the young woman in the summer dress just admiring the view off the bridge? That is the question South Korean researchers and the emergency services are working to answer using artificial intelligence to detect and prevent suicide attempts.
- In this case it is one of the researchers demonstrating how hard it can be for human surveillance teams to tell.
- But the AI system they are developing has been learning patterns of behaviour by analysing data from cameras, sensors, and the dispatch records of rescue services since April 2020, Seoul Institute of Technology said on Wednesday.
- Based on information from hours of CCTV footage and assessing details such as the hesitation of the person, the AI can then forecast a hazardous situation and immediately alert rescue teams, principal researcher Kim Jun-chul said.
- “We believe the new CCTV will enable our crews to detect the cases a bit faster and help us head to a call more promptly,” Kim Hyeong-gil, who is in charge of the Yeouido Water Rescue Brigade, told Reuters as he monitored real-time footage from bridges on Seoul's Han River.
- Kim's team have been working with the researchers to come up with the technology that his crew and the Seoul Fire and Disaster Headquarters will be piloting from October.
- Their work cannot come quickly enough.
- South Korea, with a population of 52 million people in 2019, had the highest suicide rate in the OECD. More than 13,700 people took their own lives the same year, government data showed.
- Nearly 500 suicide attempts are reported on 27 bridges over the nearly 500 km (300 miles) long Han River every year, the city said.
- The number of rescue dispatches surged about 30% in 2020 compared to the year before and many of the attempts were made by the people in their 20s and 30s as the coronavirus pandemic brought greater economic hardship and increased the battle for jobs, the rescue brigade's Kim said.
- "The system learns the footage itself, which can bring about improved results by greatly reducing false alarms," the principal researcher said.

- The Seoul Metropolitan Government recently rolled out AI-enabled CCTV cameras to prevent suicides on bridges.
- According to CTV News, the South Korean administration said it had been working on a CCTV-surveillance-and-response system since 2012.
- It is worth noting that South Korea, with a population of 52 million people in 2019, had the highest suicide rate, with more than 13,700 people ending their lives, a report by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) had revealed.
- Nearly 500 suicide attempts are reported on 27 bridges over the nearly 500-kilometre-long Han River every year, a press release by the administration stated.
- The Seoul Institute of Technology on Wednesday, said that the CCTV AI system automatically learns patterns of behavior by analyzing the data from cameras and sensors.
- Prashanth Guruswamy, co-Founder of InstaSafe Technologies, a cyber security solutions company, explains how CCTV surveillance camera works.
- "Behavioral analysis is done after using data collected from an array of sources, including CCTV footage, bridge sensors, previous suicide attempts, information from people who had previously attempted suicide, phone calls, and text messages. This data is then collated to determine a possible hazard. The AI can then forecast a hazardous situation and immediately alert rescue teams," he explained.
- Guruswamy said, "The combined data from multiple sources can lead to an accurate assessment of risks and the fact that the surveillance systems consider various environmental factors and adjust readings as per these factors, further increases the accuracy. Since this is an AI-based system, the more quantum of data is collected, the higher the accuracy."
- Any surveillance technology that is being used to analyse behavioral patterns has a high potential of being misused. The same is true for this project as well.
- "Even though Seoul authorities claim that the video data is discarded within a month as per security regulations, the potential to use this data for purposes other than suicide probability determination, is both an endearing and a worrying prospect," Guruswamy added.
- Interestingly, Korea’s privacy protection law, the Personal Information Protection ACT (PIPA) lays down very stringent regulations when it comes to collection and identification of such critical data.
- The question of ethics and privacy is the most contentious one. Many citizens worry that the use of AI-enabled cameras could restrict individual freedom. "These systems are highly intrusive because they rely on the capturing, extraction, storage, or sharing of people’s biometric facial data – often in the absence of explicit consent or prior notice," read a statement from Privacy International.
- "The need to store such critical data, and the need to address the concern that this data maybe hacked without proper security measures in place, is paramount. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as CCTV cameras, are relatively novel and the concept of IoT security is still in its infancy. As such, special care is necessary while securely transferring the data to secure servers," he asserted.
- Authorities in Russia, use AI-based cameras to check for breach in quarantine rules by potential COVID-19 carriers.
- According to Analytics Insight, in Moscow alone, there are over 1,00,000 facial recognition-enabled cameras in operation.
- China has the highest ratio of CCTV cameras to citizens in the world – 1 for every 12 people. Several media reports claim that by 2023, China will be the single biggest player in the global facial-recognition market.
- San Francisco is the first city in North America to ban facial recognition technology. Several other cities, including Oakland and Northampton, too, have voted to ban the technology. Following their footsteps, France and Sweden recently banned the use of facial recognition in schools.
- "Implementation of such technology not only requires the necessary infrastructure, the cost of which could be large, but it would also result in a significant discounting of existing rights to privacy in the name of the greater good and may well be termed by critics as the first step towards a surveillance state," Guruswamy said.
- Sourajeet Majumder, a cyber security expert, told The Quint that If India uses this technology it will only lead to mass surveillance. "In the absence of personal data privacy laws, it would impossible to trace how the government is using our personal data. This will lead to mass surveillance, which violates right to privacy and freedom of expression," he said.

- TORONTO, Ontario (CTV Network) —  The Seoul Metropolitan Government has announced a new pilot project to address suicides on bridges spanning the Han River, the main waterway bisecting the city, by rolling out AI-enabled CCTV cameras that use deep learning to identify the “patterns” of people in crisis.
- Currently, Seoul has CCTV operators working on three rotating shifts that cover 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at four different control centres in the Yeouido, Banpo, Ttukseom and Gwangnaru neighbourhoods on the river.
- In a statement emailed to CTVNews.ca, the Seoul Metropolitan Government said it has been operating a CCTV surveillance and response system since 2012 on the Mapo and Seogang Bridges spanning the Han River, as they have the highest number of suicide attempts, monitoring the bridges 24 hours a day and “proactively responding to suicide attempts.”
- From 2015 to 2018, the Seoul Metropolitan Government invested approximately CAD$10.3 million to expand their system to eight more bridges, installing 20 CCTV systems comprising three types – fixed, rotating and thermographic cameras – on all 10 bridges.
- The system allows rescuers to monitor the bridge through 572 CCTVs in real-time and arrive at the scene in four minutes, the statement said.
- In a press release, the government explained that the new partnership between the Seoul Institute of Technology and the Seoul Fire&Disaster Headquarters (SFDH) is aimed at improving the current suicide detection system – and has been analyzing data from SFDH since April 2020.
- The data includes dispatch reports, CCTV footage, data from bridge sensors, information from people who had previously attempted suicide, report history, phone calls and text messages.
- The AI system would then send the CCTV footage that it flagged to a monitoring agent at the new integrated control centre to dispatch the relevant authorities.
- “This system allows rapid responses to suicide attempts—both before or after an incident—and minimizes surveillance loopholes. Not only that, but it can also dramatically reduce warning errors thanks to AI’s ability to reflect environmental factors, including illumination levels and weather, as well as characteristics of Han River bridges such as wobbling caused by winds and traffic. As data accumulates, the accuracy of the system will increase further,” the release states.
- According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government, every year approximately 486 people attempt suicide on bridges spanning the Han River and authorities are able to save 96.63 per cent.
- While many would laud the purpose of such a high-tech solution to a social issue that is rampant in South Korea – the country with the highest rate of suicides amongst OECD countries — privacy experts remain divided on the merits of such a program and whether this would be approved for use in Canada.
- SURVEILLANCE INFRASTRUCTURE South Korea’s surveillance infrastructure is vast, with more than 1.15 million CCTV cameras installed across the country, according to a 2019 Statista report estimate – a number expected to grow.
- In its emailed statement, the Seoul Metropolitan Government said that as of December 2020, the city was managing 75,431 CCTVs “installed for security, facility management and traffic safety.”
- The country’s Personal Information Protection ACT (PIPA) has strict compliance requirements for both the private and public sector when it comes to identifying information. However, government agencies that require personal data for public interest purposes can collect and use data without the need to obtain consent – for many Koreans, surveillance on such a scale is simply a part of daily life.
- This played out in South Korea’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where health authorities could zero-in on contact tracing with astonishing precision thanks to the Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act.
- Health authorities could conduct an investigation using CCTV, credit card transaction data and mobile phone tracking to warn close contacts of their exposure to someone with COVID-19, and to dispatch sterilization teams to disinfect areas the person had visited.
- Emergency alert text messages were sent to all mobile phones through Korea’s cellular broadcasting service, which was also used by the government and health authorities to update citizens on new cases and issue warnings on COVID-19 hot spots.
- That kind of surveillance and data gathering in other countries like Canada would be blocked by more stringent data protection and privacy laws.
- And while an AI-enabled CCTV camera may assist authorities to help someone in a crisis – privacy experts are divided on whether the end result justifies the means.
- Former Ontario privacy commissioner Ann Cavoukian said that while its “admirable” the Seoul Metropolitan Government is addressing concerns about suicide, using AI-enabled CCTV is an “encroachment on privacy.”
- “At the very least, the government should be providing signage and give notice to the public walking on these bridges that these new measures are in effect,” Cavoukian said in a telephone interview with CTVNews.ca. “There will be no privacy, and people should be made fully aware that when they walk on that bridge, their identity is being captured, along with what they’re doing.”
- Cavoukian said she doesn’t believe a program like Seoul’s would be authorized for use in Canada, as “people don’t want to be tracked.”
- “That’s what this will enable you to do, whether you do it intentionally or not,” she said. “Once it starts, that’s what will happen, and then law enforcement will use it…in the last two years concern for privacy has been on an all time high, so I don’t think it would be popular here personally.”
- David Fraser, a privacy lawyer with McInness Cooper in Halifax, N.S., disagrees – but says the program would have to be monitored closely.
- “Using video surveillance technologies, particularly when coupled with something that resembles biometrics, more resembles artificial intelligence,” Fraser said in a telephone interview. “There’s a real good reason to be nervous about that and to scrutinise it very closely.”
- However, Fraser said that “at the end of the day” Seoul’s pilot project is a “very interesting” application of AI technology that’s “clearly intended to reduce the loss of life and actually proactively save people’s lives.”
- “Really, what could be the negative impacts or implications for individuals other than perhaps you have a pedestrian crossing the bridge with no intention to harm themselves and having an intervention,” Fraser said of the program. “I think I would be supportive of the project as long as the kind of diligence has also gone into making sure that the images and videos they’re collecting in order to feed their machine learning is appropriately protected, with appropriate controls.”
- And while Canada does not have the same mass surveillance culture that South Korea has, Fraser pointed out that CCTV cameras in places like subway stations, train stations and bus stations could be eligible places for a program like Seoul’s should Canada want to implement it.
- “I think you would probably find the nearest subway station in Canada is covered in every square inch with CCTV cameras,” Fraser said. “If such a programme were to be proposed in Canada, those transit authorities are all public sector, and all subject to privacy laws that regulate the collection use and disclosure of personal information, which for some information includes video images.”
- Fraser said any such program proposed in Canada would have to go through a rigorous process known as a “Privacy Impact Assessment,” which weighs the ethical and logical scope of any policy that could impact Canadians’ privacy – including only collecting the information needed and to minimise the collection of any data that is not needed, and supervision of the analysis of said data.
- ‘FUNCTION CREEP’ The Seoul Metropolitan Government denied in its statement that there were privacy concerns associated with the project, saying it had been “provided with de-identified video data from the Seoul Fire & Disaster Headquarters for scientific research purposes only to extract ‘features’ for deep learning.” The statement reiterated “there is no possibility to raise concern [sic] because the video data is discarded after use according to security procedures on a monthly basis.”
- Fraser likened Seoul’s pilot project to the phenomena of people giving up private medical information in order to raise awareness or to assist in research to prevent “what happened to them happening to others.”
- However, Fraser did echo Cavoukian’s concerns about the potential for the erosion of privacy, saying he was cautious of “function creep.”
- “So cameras were probably put there in the first place for a specific purpose… including identifying people at risk of self-harm,” Fraser said. “But putting in any new technology, that changes the game.”
- Fraser said ethical complications can arise when seemingly innocent ideas on expanding the mandate of the original system are put forward.
- “What happens when somebody says, ‘Hey, we have a problem with pickpockets, so let’s tweak the model so we can identify people who are pickpocketing?’” Fraser said. “The tweaks seem incremental and before you know it, we have a surveillance system that’s identifying people and leading to law enforcement interventions – you just have to look at wellness checks and police interventions to see how often those end in really bad outcomes.”
- Fraser said any project like Seoul’s has to be preceded by “carefully asking ourselves the appropriate questions.”
- “I think we also need to always be doing a bit of a reality check when it comes to this — societally, how are we with this?”

- This article was originally posted on our sister site, Freethink.
- Seoul is deploying an AI-powered CCTV system designed to predict suicide attempts at its many bridges — and send rescuers to help people in distress.
- Suicide bridges: South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, with about 27 suicides per 100,000 people in 2019 — by comparison, the U.S. rate that year was about 14.
- The 27 bridges crossing South Korea’s Han River have a bad reputation for drawing such attempts — but that may be about to change.
- The AI program will detect and predict suicide attempts by analyzing CCTV footage.
- Sending help: In an attempt to prevent suicides, Seoul, the nation’s capital, has established four centers along the Han River where workers monitor live video feeds from nearly 600 CCTV cameras fixed on 10 bridges.
- If one of the workers sees someone attempt suicide or suspects that a person is about to jump, they can have rescuers at the bridge within just four minutes.
- The challenge: This system has allowed Seoul to save 96% of the nearly 500 people who set out to commit suicide at the bridges every year, but it can be difficult for workers to predict suicide attempts.
- If a monitor sends a rescue team out when one isn’t needed, that’s a waste of resources. If they dismiss an actual suicide attempt as someone admiring the view, that could lead to the loss of a life.
- The idea: The city believes AI can hone the accuracy of its suicide prevention system.
- Since April 2020, the Seoul Institute of Technology has been training an AI program to detect and predict suicide attempts by analyzing CCTV footage depicting both actual suicide attempts and people simply visiting the bridges.
- “We believe the new CCTV will enable our crews to detect the cases a bit faster.”KIM HYEONG-GIL
- Seoul is now launching a pilot program in which the AI will monitor the CCTV feeds and alert center workers to any suspicious footage. At the end of the year, it will use what it learns from to fully launch the AI-powered system.
- “We believe the new CCTV will enable our crews to detect the cases a bit faster and help us head to a call more promptly,” Kim Hyeong-gil, who is in charge of the Yeouido Water Rescue Brigade, told Reuters.
- Eyes on everyone: Video surveillance is an ethically complex subject, and some have expressed concerns that Seoul’s AI is an invasion of privacy that will be used to track people.
- “At the very least, the government should be providing signage and give notice to the public walking on these bridges that these new measures are in effect,” Ann Cavoukian, former privacy commissioner of Ontario, Canada, told CTV News.
- Looking ahead: Only time will tell whether the AI actually improves Seoul’s ability to predict suicide attempts and send help in time to stop them.
- If it does work as hoped, similar AIs could one day monitor other high-risk locations, potentially helping lower the rate of suicides in South Korea and beyond.

- South Korea’s surveillance infrastructure is vast. In 2015, the National Information Society Agency estimated that the CCTV cameras across the country numbered in the millions - with more than 115,891 CCTV cameras newly installed by the government in public places in 2019, according to a Statista report estimate.
