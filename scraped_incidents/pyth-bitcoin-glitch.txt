- Bloomberg reports that the recent 90% collapse in the price of Bitcoin from around USD 41,000 to USD 5,402 was likely due to a glitch on crypto data network Pyth.
- According to a Pyth investigatory report 'The issue was caused by the combination of (1) two different Pyth publishers publishing a near-zero price for BTC/USD and (2) the aggregation logic overweighting these publishers’ contributions and both publishers encountered problems related to the handling of decimal numbers.'
- Whilst the impact on Bitcoin investors remains unclear, it seems some financial trading systems automatically sold Bitcoin in response to the apparent drop in price.

- On Monday, some crypto investors may have noticed that the price for Bitcoin plummeted down to about $5,400.
- That would be catastrophic, coming down from around $50,000 earlier this month. But the price never actually dropped — at least not that much. The precipitous devaluation was a glitch on Pyth, a crypto data platform that's contributed to by several finance giants on Wall Street, Bloomberg reports. It's still not clear how much the glitch — and investors' possible responses to it — had on Bitcoin's real price, which also took a hit, but it's still a shocking error for a platform that's used by such major players.
- In reality, Bitcoin's price is right around $44,000 as of Wednesday afternoon. That price comes as part of a notable drop over the course of the last week, but even that hallmark crypto volatility is nothing like what Pyth users would have seen before the glitch was corrected on Tuesday.
- The latest update from Pyth is a tweet from Monday saying that engineers were looking into the issue. It's hard to tell if the glitch had an impact on Bitcoin's price, if it had one at all, according to Bloomberg.
- A glitch on one platform can easily be exposed by double-checking the data anywhere else, so it's unlikely that most people using Pyth would have panicked and dumped their crypto.
- However, some automated systems relying on the data did automatically sell off some Bitcoin in response to the perceived sudden drop in price, according to a tweet from the Bonfida network.

- A cryptocurrency data network run by some of Wall Street’s biggest players showed a roughly 90% plunge in Bitcoin on Monday, a glitch that didn’t show up on other platforms. The platform, called Pyth, tweeted that on Monday the world's largest cryptocurrency's price showed as $5,402 on its platform, whereas it actually was hovering around $41,000.
- Pyth had said that its engineers are continuing to investigate the cause and a full report is in the works. The network has now released the report of what caused the incident - on a root cause analysis of bad BTC/USD prices, including what caused it and corrective actions.
- Explaining the root cause, Pyth said that the “issue was caused by the combination of (1) two different Pyth publishers publishing a near-zero price for BTC/USD and (2) the aggregation logic overweighting these publishers’ contributions and both publishers encountered problems related to the handling of decimal numbers.
- The first publisher encountered a bug in which they submitted their price as a floating-point number where this utility expected an integer and the second publisher encountered a race condition between two programs that resulted in them reading an exponent of 10^0 for BTC/USD instead of 10^-8 for the 2-minute interval of the incident.
- Things seem to have returned to normal Tuesday. Bitcoin’s price was recently given as $41,888, close to prevailing levels. This was the second recent problem as the network which connects to the Solana blockchain, stopped working for more than 17 hours last week.
- Pyth said its core developers are taking several steps to prevent these issues from happening again.

- Latest news about Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies. Your daily crypto news habit.
- Monday’s market crash resulted in billion-dollar liquidations in the crypto space. The Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted under $45,000 that day, however, a network glitch on the Pyth platform showed that the BTC price plummeted 90% dropping all the way to $5,400.
- The crypto data network Pyth is run by some of Wall streets biggest players. Besides, it provides industrial-grade pricing information for asset classes like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Some of its data feed contributors include giants like FTX, DRW, and the Jump Trading Group. Recently, Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital also joined the Pyth Network.
- For a very brief period on Monday, the Pyth Network showed the Bitcoin price as $5,400. The platform made an official statement through its Twitter handle that reads:
- Between 12:21 and 12:23 UTC the Pyth BTCUSD aggregate price was below $40,000 – the lowest price reported was $5,402 with a confidence interval of $21,623 (4x the asset reported price) for a single slot – which was off-market relative to the BTC price available on other markets. Engineers are continuing to investigate the cause and a full report is in the works.
- On Tuesday, things have returned back to normal. Besides, the Pyth platform has unveiled a root cause analysis of what actually resulted in the software glitch.
- However, the problem wasn’t just limited to Bitcoin price reporting. Several Solana-based programs relying on the Pyth price were impacted by this incident. As Pyth reported:
- The impact was exacerbated due to some programs relying on the aggregate price feed without using the confidence, which allowed liquidations to occur even though the published price was highly uncertain.
- The entire Pyth network was down as a result of the outage. Bonfida, a project built on Solana, said that decline resulted in a series of liquidations on the Audaces protocol BTC-PERP market. Audaces is the perpetual futures platform on Bonfida.
