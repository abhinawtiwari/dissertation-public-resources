- Images of an automated New York Police Department (NYPD) 'digidog' equipped with surveillance cameras responding to a hostage situation have drawn complaints from the local community, rights activists, and politicians.
- The NYPD used the Boston Dynamics-manufactured Spot dog to surveil a house in the Bronx in which two men were holding two others hostage. The suspects were later arrested.
- The incident prompted concerns about the technical capabilities of the robot, the scope for misuse and abuse, and its use in lower-income communities. It also raised questions about transparency, with the ACLU asking why the NYPD had failed to list it on its public disclosure of surveillance devices.
- The Honolulu Police Department has since been found to have been using Spot to take the temperature of homeless people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Boston Robotics is one of six robotics companies that wrote an open letter pledging not to pursue or allow the weaponisation of their general-purpose robots.
- In April 2023, the NYPD announced the acquisition of two Digidogs, at a cost of USD 750,000.

- Who’s a good bot?
- The NYPD deployed its new robotic dog to a home invasion crime scene in the Bronx on Tuesday morning, new video shows.
- Video shows the blue and black, four-legged “Digidog” trotting along the sidewalk, joined by its handlers.
- The videographer, Daniel Valls of FreedomNews.tv, wrote that the dog responded to a home invasion and barricaded situation on East 227th Street near White Plains Road in Wakefield.
- A spokeswoman for the NYPD said the 70-pound robot is in its test phase and is equipped with lights and cameras to allows cops to see “its surroundings in real-time.”
- It also comes with two-way communication, the spokewoman added.
- Cops confirmed responding to that address for an ongoing investigation and finding no one there.
- The “dog” weighs 70 pounds, can run about three-and-a-half miles per hour and climb stairs, members of the NYPD’s Technical Assistance Response Unit told ABC 7 back in December. It is covered in cameras and lights.
- “This dog is going to save lives, protect people, and protect officers and that’s our goal,” TARU Inspector Frank Digiacomo said.
- “This robot is able to use its artificial intelligence to navigate things, very complex environments,” NYPD TARU’s Deepu John added.
- The department also deployed a robotic dog back in October to a Brooklyn shooting, after the gunman holed up in a nearby basement.

- New York City councilmember Ben Kallos says he “watched in horror” last month when city police responded to a hostage situation in the Bronx using Boston Dynamics’ Digidog, a remotely operated robotic dog equipped with surveillance cameras. Pictures of the Digidog went viral on Twitter, in part due to their uncanny resemblance with world-ending machines in the Netflix sci-fi series Black Mirror.
- Now Kallos is proposing what may be the nation’s first law banning police from owning or operating robots armed with weapons.
- “I don't think anyone was anticipating that they'd actually be used by the NYPD right now,” Kallos says. ”I have no problem with using a robot to defuse a bomb, but it has to be the right use of a tool and the right type of circumstance.”
- Kallos’ bill would not ban unarmed utility robots like the Digidog, only weaponized robots. But robotics experts and ethicists say he has tapped into concerns about the increasing militarization of police: their increasing access to sophisticated robots through private vendors and a controversial military equipment pipeline. Police in Massachusetts and Hawaii are testing the Digidog as well.
- “Nonlethal robots could very well morph into lethal ones,” says Patrick Lin, director of the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo. Lin briefed CIA employees on autonomous weapons during the Obama administration and supports a ban on armed robots. He worries their increased availability poses a serious concern.
- “Robots can save police lives, and that’s a good thing,” he says. “But we also need to be careful it doesn’t make a police force more violent.”
- In the Bronx incident last month, police used the Digidog to gather intel on the house where two men were holding two others hostage, scoping out hiding places and tight corners. Police ultimately apprehended the suspects, but privacy advocates raised concerns about the technical capabilities of the robot and policies governing its use.
- “Nonlethal robots could very well morph into lethal ones.”
- The ACLU questioned why the Digidog was not listed on the police department’s disclosure of surveillance devices under a city law passed last year. The robot was only mentioned in passing in a section on “situational awareness cameras.” The ACLU called that disclosure “highly inadequate,” criticizing the “weak data protection and training sections” regarding Digidog.
- In a statement, the NYPD said it “has been using robots since the 1970s to save lives in hostage situations and hazmat incidents. This model of robot is being tested to evaluate its capabilities against other models in use by our Emergency Service Unit and Bomb Squad.”
- In a statement, Boston Dynamics CEO Robert Playter said the company's terms of service prohibit attaching weapons to its robots. “All of our buyers, without exception, must agree that Spot will not be used as a weapon or configured to hold a weapon,” Playter said. "As an industry, we think robots will achieve long-term commercial viability only if people see robots as helpful, beneficial tools without worrying if they’re going to cause harm.”
- Local response to the use of the Digidog was mixed, says councilmember Kevin Riley, who represents the Bronx neighborhood where the incident ocurred. Some residents opposed police use of the robot and others wanted more human police presence. A third group thought the robots might help prevent police misconduct by creating distance between officers and suspects.

- Rhett Allain
- Riley says he’s continuing to speak with residents, who want to feel safe in the neighborhood. “It’s our job as elected officials to educate residents and make sure they have a seat at the table” in discussions, he told WIRED.
- The diversity of concerns mirror those in Dallas in 2016. During a standoff with a sniper, local law enforcement used a robot to remotely deliver and detonate an explosive device, killing him. The sniper had shot and killed five police officers.
- The incident raised questions about how police acquire robots. Dallas police had at least three bomb robots in 2016. Two were acquired from the defense contractor Northrop Grumman, according to Reuters. The third came through the federal government’s 1033 program, which permits the transfer of surplus military equipment to local police departments. Since 1997, over 8,000 police departments have received over $7 billion in equipment.
- A 2016 study from Bard University found that over 280 police agencies in the US had received robots through the 1033 system. One Colorado officer told local press his department acquired as many as a dozen military robots of varying condition, then uses the one that functions best.
- President Obama placed limits on the types of equipment that police departments can obtain through the system, but President Trump later reversed them.
- The lack of a unified federal response, the increasing number of private vendors furnishing robots, and increasing militarization of the police has made criminal justice and robotics experts wary. They don’t want to wait for a tragedy to consider a ban on weaponized robots.
- “The goal for any kind of technology should be harm reduction and de-escalation,” says Peter Asaro, a roboticist and professor at the School of Media Studies at the New School.
- “It's almost always the police officer arguing that they're defending themselves by using lethal force,” he says. “But a robot has no right to self-defense. So why would it be justified in using lethal force?”
- Asaro notes that SWAT teams were created to handle bank robberies and armed riots. Now, they’re overwhelmingly used to serve narcotics warrants, as many as 60,000 times a year nationwide. The rare hostage situation solved by robot intervention, he worries, could justify increasing their use.
- Shortly after the Dallas incident, police in Delaware acquired the same type of bomb robot and trained officers in a similar scenario. In 2018, police in Maine used a bomb robot to detonate an explosive and enter the home of a man firing at police from his roof.
- “I’m concerned that a democracy is turning domestic police into a militarized zone.”
- “This is happening now,” says Melissa Hamilton, a scholar in Law and Criminal Justice at the University of Surrey in the UK and a former police officer. Hamilton says she’s heard of US police departments running drills similar to the 2016 incident in Dallas, using robots to detonate explosives—not just to neutralize suspects, but to enter buildings or end standoffs.
- “I’m concerned that a democracy is turning domestic police into a militarized zone,” she says.
- This increasing militarization is part of why Kallos, the New York councilmember, wants to “avoid investing in an ever escalating arms race when these dollars could be better spent” elsewhere.
- Lin, the Cal Poly professor, worries that many police officers do not live in the communities they patrol, and remote policing could worsen an “us-versus-them” divide. The Digidog would not be banned under Kallos' bill, but Lin says military drones offer a cautionary tale. They too began strictly as reconnaissance devices before being weaponized.
- “It’s hard to see a reason why this wouldn’t happen with police drones, given the trend toward greater militarization,” Lin says.
- Updated, 3-18-21, 12:05pm ET: This article has been updated to include a statement from Boston Dynamics.

- Residents in Bronx, New York City on Tuesday woke up to find a “creepy” blue coloured robot dog with cameras, lights, and walkie-talkies sprinting around the town that looked nothing like a K-9. Later identified as the New York Police Department (NYPD)’s Digidog, the 70 pound Boston Dynamics machine was learned to have been newly deployed by the officers to diffuse the ‘home invasion’ instances. Running on trial basis, the digital police dog has already participated in 2 hostage situations [later confirmed to be a false alarm] and is named ‘Spot’ by the police officers. Although, Spot has attracted some weird reactions from the inhabitants of the city as well as politicians as it was spotted climbing the stairs in footages that emerged, reminding people of the dystopian science fiction movie Black Mirror.
- As it patrolled the streets of Brooklyn, Queens, and until recently Bronx for the NYPD, the electric motorised dog was met with distinctive looks by onlookers. According to New York’s broadcasters, the unweaponised robot dog was found recording the scenes on surveillance cam cabled to a transmitter, zooming in and zooming out and beaming back the footages to the police officers.

- “That thing is creepy,” a voice recorded on live footage shared by a local television network on YouTube said. The digidog, which cost the New York police an estimated $US74,500 ($A93,500) is assigned to counter emergency situations with a task to save lives, protect people, and protect officers, according to NYPD Technical Assistance Response Unit Inspector Frank Digiacomo’s statement to abc7ny. Spot uses the artificial intelligence AI to navigate and process very complex environments, NYPD TARU's Deepu John separately added.
- NYPD’s Digidog is capable of two-way communication, meaning it can simultaneously connect the suspect and the police to have a conversation. It is the recent sighing on Bronx’s streets flashing lights and a large camera module as it sprints on 4 metal legs, at times mysteriously rotating camera at 360 degrees and zooming in on a subject without warning. The robot dog is designed to keep people “out of harm’s way”, NYPD explained to the local press reporters.
- However, contrary to NYPD’s vision of its electronic police dog, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who represents Bronx and Queens condemned the use of the machine on Twitter, saying: “Shout out to everyone who fought against community advocates who demanded these resources go to investments like school counseling instead. Now robotic surveillance ground drones are being deployed for testing on low-income communities of color with under-resourced schools.”

- Last week, the NYPD sent a robotic dog to an active crime scene in the Bronx, where a home invasion was underway in a Wakefield area apartment building. The creepy footage of the bright-blue four-legged robot casually walking down the street raised our collective hackles. What exactly was it doing on the scene? And are we all about to enter a real-life episode of Black Mirror?
- Predictably, the NYPD is tight-lipped about its newest robotic toy (as it is about virtually everything else it does). But here’s what we know so far.
- It’s Spot, a 70-pound robotic dog being tested by the NYPD. The department nicknamed the particular one it’s using “Digidog.”
- Boston Dynamics. The company has been around since the ’90s, when it spun out of Marc Raibert’s research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory on advanced robots. Boston Dynamics has developed all sorts of robots, including some that can move boxes and have humanlike agility. It has also developed a few for military use with funding from DARPA, a defense agency that often funds a lot of tech and innovation, including, decades ago, the creation of the internet itself. In December 2020, Hyundai bought a majority stake in the company from Softbank (which had bought it from Google in 2017) for $1.1 billion. The company introduced a Spot prototype in 2015, intending to turn it into a commercial product, and started selling them in summer 2020.
- Spot can walk and navigate space via remote control and can be programmed to follow a specific route. It doesn’t just work on flat asphalt: The robot dog can walk up stairs and curbs and traverse grass and gravel. It can carry about 30 pounds of equipment, and, eerily enough, it can even dance. An arm upgrade, allowing it to open doors and the like, has just become available.
- Spot’s maximum speed is 1.6 meters per second (roughly 3.5 miles per hour, the average walking speed of a human). So if you’re concerned about a Black Mirror kind of incident —and particularly if you remember a 2017 episode called “Metalhead,” in which a robot dog chases a speeding van, crashes through its back window (while it’s still in motion!), and obliterates the driver’s head with one bash —rest assured that you can probably outrun Spot. The Wildcat, another robot built by Boston Dynamics, can run about 20 miles per hour. Good thing this one isn’t wandering around.
- Nope — but it can be equipped with two-way communication so the human operator could make a barking sound through the robot.
- It’s equipped with cameras that enable the human operator to see 360 degrees around the robot, in daylight or using night vision. Its five depth cameras, in-body force sensors, and various optimization algorithms also help it move around, according to Boston Dynamics.
- Not exactly. It’s operated by humans via remote control. A member of the NYPD’s Technical Assistance Research Unit told ABC 7 News that running it is like playing a video game. However, there is a “docking” function that can instruct the robot to “return home” by just pushing a button, Roomba-style. And then there’s a preprogrammed-route function: Give it directions, and it’ll do its thing.
- Spot has been commercially available since 2020 at a starting price of $74,500.
- Nobody will say. But the NYPD frequently “tests” emerging products from tech companies. New York City served as the primary testing ground for IBM’s surveillance technology, which allowed police departments to use facial-recognition software to search camera footage for images of people by hair color, facial hair, and skin tone. That tryout ran between 2012 and 2016 with no civic oversight. It’s not hard to imagine that robot dogs will similarly become part of the policing landscape. Efforts to regulate all these tech products — and publicly disclose how they work — have failed so far.
- We know of at least two other moments when Spot did its thing. In October, after a man shot a woman in a parking dispute in Brooklyn, the NYPD sent the robot into a basement where the shooter had barricaded himself. And in December, the NYPD also deployed its Digidog to a hostage situation in Queens, using the robot to deliver some food to the people inside.
- #HappeningNow NYPD robot dog deployed in the BronxVideo by Daniel Valls (FNTV https://t.co/rhaCXIA0Nv ) Desk@freedomnews.tv pic.twitter.com/NoOZewxUwL
- In a 90-day trial in 2019, the Massachusetts State Police was the first law-enforcement agency to use Spot. The agency tried it out in situations where it would be dangerous to send a human, mostly on calls by the bomb squad. At that time, the robot was spooked by tall grass, fell over while walking down stairs, and paced in place when it encountered an incline.
- Spot is also being used by the oil company BP to do inspection work in remote locations such as oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and to read instrument panels; by Ford to do scans of factories in preparation for retooling, saving cost and time; and by NASA to explore remote locations on Earth and possibly for deployment on the moon. National Grid is using it to inspect substations, and Foster + Partners used the robot to assist with site visits and to compare construction work to the specifications in documents.
- In a use that’s either cheeky or foreboding, an arts organization equipped its Spot with a paintball gun and programmed it to allow users to control it remotely to spray a gallery with paint. Boston Dynamics condemned this use on Twitter and pointed out that all buyers of Spot must abide by the company’s terms and conditions, which forbid any use that intimidates or harms humans or animals and stipulate that it must not be used as a weapon or configured to hold a weapon. If Boston Dynamics finds out about a user violating the terms, it will void the warranty and prevent the robot from being updated, serviced, repaired or replaced.
- We’re not sure! But, as the paintball incident illustrates, in the wrong hands (human or robotic), something could go awry. What if the paintball gun were a real gun? Memes have even been circulating with tips on what to do to ‘disable’ Spot manually; Boston Dynamics hasn’t confirmed if they actually work. Spot might not be equipped with weapons yet, but there’s really no way to know what the future may bring.

- Drone warfare abroad is bad enough. Let’s not apply the same kinds of technologies to domestic policing
- The New York police department has acquired a robotic police dog, known as Digidog, and has deployed it on the streets of Brooklyn, Queens and, most recently, the Bronx. At a time that activists in New York, and beyond, are calling for the defunding of police departments – for the sake of funding more vital services that address the root causes of crime and poverty – the NYPD’s decision to pour money into a robot dog seems tone-deaf if not an outright provocation.
- As Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents parts of Queens and the Bronx, put it on Twitter: “Shout out to everyone who fought against community advocates who demanded these resources go to investments like school counseling instead. Now robotic surveillance ground drones are being deployed for testing on low-income communities of color with underresourced schools.”
- There is more than enough evidence that law enforcement is lethally racially biased, and adding an intimidating non-human layer to it seems cruel. And, as we’ve seen with artificial intelligence domestically and autonomous drone warfare abroad, it is clear that already dehumanized Black and Muslim residents will be the ones to face the brunt of the damage of this dystopian development, particularly in a city with a history of both anti-Black racism and Islamophobia.
- Law enforcement in the United States is already biased and grounded in a history of systemic racism. Many police departments in the US evolved from slave-catching units or union-busting militias, and their use today to disproportionately capture and imprison Black people drips of those origins. And it isn’t just the institutions themselves that perpetuate racism; individual police officers are also biased and more likely to view Black people as threats. Even Black police officers share these biases and often replicate the harm of their white counterparts. On top of that, the NYPD in particular has a history of targeting its Arab and Muslim population, even going as far as to use undercover agents to spy on Muslim student associations in surrounding states. Any new technological development will only give police departments new tools to further surveil, and potentially to arrest or kill, Black and Muslim people.
- By removing the human factor, artificial intelligence may appear to be an “equalizer” in the same vein as more diverse police departments. But AI shares the biases of our society. Coded Biases, a 2020 documentary, followed the journey of Joy Buolamwini, a PhD candidate at MIT, as she set out to expose the inability of facial recognition software to distinguish dark-skinned women from one another. While many tech companies have now ceased providing this software to police departments due to the dangers it may pose, police departments themselves have doubled down on the use of other forms of AI-driven law enforcement.
- Police already use location-based AI to determine when and where crime may occur, and individual-based AI to identify people deemed to have an increased probability of committing crime. While these tools are considered a more objective way of policing, they are dependent on data from biased police departments, courts and prisons. For example, Black people are more likely to be arrested for drug-related crimes, and thus appear more likely to commit crime, despite being less likely to sell drugs in the first place.
- The use of human operators will do little to offset the biases of AI programming. Remote-controlled drones create a layer of dehumanization that is already present in police interactions. Drone operators have complained of the trauma that has come from seeing other human beings as little more than pixels on a screen. In February 2020, a US air force drone operator compared the US military to Nazi Germany after allegedly being asked to kill an Afghan child that his overseers insisted was a dog. Speaking to ABC’s Eyewitness News, an operator of the NYPD’s robot dog troublingly described the process of operating the urban drone as “as simple as playing a video game”.
- While Boston Dynamics, the creators of the robot dog, have insisted that Digidog will never be used as a weapon, it is highly unlikely that that will remain true. MSCHF, a political art collective, has already shown how easy it is to weaponize the dog. In February they mounted a paintball gun on its back and used it to fire upon a series of art pieces in a gallery. The future of weaponized robot policing has already been paved by the Dallas police department. In 2016, the DPD used a robot armed with a bomb to kill Micah Johnson, an army reservist who served in Afghanistan, after he killed five police officers in what he said was retaliation for the deaths of Black people at the hands of law enforcement. While it was clear that he posed a threat to police, it is very fitting that a Black man would be the first person to be killed by an armed robot in the United States – roughly a year after the white mass shooter Dylann Roof was met with a free burger and police protection.
- A small handful of Muslim Americans have also been killed by drones, though in other countries. The most glaring case was that of Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, a 16-year-old US citizen. Abdulrahman was the son of an alleged al-Qaida strategist, Anwar al-Awlaki. Both were killed in separate drone strikes, despite never being charged with crimes, let alone given any form of trial. While it is easy to condemn Anwar al-Awlaki, there has been no evidence provided whatsoever that justified the killing of Abdulrahman. When President Obama’s White House press secretary was questioned about the killing, he simply implied that the boy’s father should have chosen a different occupation.
- Abdulrahman was an innocent teenage boy whose death should have caused a nationwide uproar; aside from groups like the ACLU, however, his death went relatively unnoticed and unopposed. It seems doubtful that Americans would have so callously ignored the death of a white teenager in a drone bombing. And it is equally doubtful that a police department with a history of Islamophobia would hesitate to use robot dogs and aerial drones to expand its targeting of Muslim and Arab people.
- The United Nations has called for a ban on autonomous weapons, and not long ago many countries around the world desired to ban armed drones. But the United States unfortunately continues to set the precedent for drone and autonomous warfare, driving other countries to follow suit in competition. We can’t allow our government to replicate this dynamic inside our borders, also, with the domestic use of drones and robotic police.
- This is a time for the US to scale back its wars, internal and external, but instead, the NYPD, which many people – including former mayor Michael Bloomberg – consider an army, has chosen to lead the way in dystopian enforcement.

- The cyberpunk dystopia is here! (If you weren’t aware: I’m sorry. You’re living in a cyberpunk dystopia.) The latest sign — aside from corporations controlling many aspects of everyday life, massive widespread wealth inequality, and the recent prominence of bisexual lighting — comes in the form of robot dogs deployed to do jobs human police used to. Yesterday, as the New York Post reports, the NYPD deployed Boston Dynamics’ robot “dog” Spot to a home invasion crime scene in the Bronx.
- The video was taken by videographer Daniel Valls, of FreedomNews.tv. You can hear a voice say “that thing is creepy” as the robot prances past the camera. The Post reports that a spokesperson for the NYPD said the robot is in a test phase, presumably to see if it’s actually useful out in the field. (It was equipped with lights and cameras, the spokesperson continued, to ensure that NYPD could see whatever the robot was seeing.)
- This isn’t the first time the NYPD has deployed one of Boston Dynamics’ robots. Back in October, the department used another Spot to find a gunman who’d barricaded himself in a building after he’d accidentally shot someone in the head during a parking dispute in Brooklyn.
- While I think it’s probably a good thing that robots are being used more often in situations that might be dangerous for a human, it is more than a little unnerving to see the things that happen in books begin to happen in real life.

- The NYPD's robot dog is once again stirring privacy concerns and cyberpunk prophesies of some New Yorkers, after the four-legged machine was spotted inside of a Manhattan public housing complex on Monday.
- 
- A video shared on Twitter shows the robot trotting out of a building on East 28th Street in front of two NYPD officers, then slowly descending the stairs as bystanders look on in shock. "I've never seen nothing like this before in my life," one woman can be heard saying.
- The remote-controlled bot was made by Boston Dynamics, a robotics company famous for its viral videos of machines dancing and running with human-like dexterity. (Versions of "Spot," as the mechanical dog is known, can open doors, and are strong enough to help tow an 18-wheeler.)
- 
- Since October, the NYPD has dispatched the robot to a handful of crime scenes and hostage situations, raising fears of unwanted surveillance and questions about the department's use of public dollars. The mobile dog, which comes equipped with automated sensors, lights, and cameras capable of collecting "limitless data," is sold at a starting price of $74,000.
- 
- A spokesperson for the NYPD said the robot dog was on standby, but not used, during a domestic dispute at East 28th Street on Monday afternoon. After a man allegedly barricaded himself inside a room with a mother and her baby, officers showed up and convinced him to let them exit. The man was arrested for weapons possession, police said.
- 
- "Right now it seems to be a fancy toy in search of an actual use case," Albert Fox Cahn, the founder of the advocacy group Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), told Gothamist. "It's really alarming to see them roll out these props from a bad Black Mirror episode without any real public safety justification."
- The bot has also sparked fears about increasing police militarization, and the possibility that it could pave the way for even more concerning technology, such as weaponized drones, in the future. The Dallas police department previously used an explosive-packed robot to kill a gunman in 2016. Last month, City Councilmember Ben Kallos introduced legislation that would ban the NYPD from using "weaponized robots."
- 
- In response to such concerns, the NYPD has countered that they have long used robots for hostage negotiations and bomb scares, and added that the mechanical dog is "being tested to evaluate its capabilities."
- 
- But their defense has only irked reform advocates, who said the department should not be testing the advanced technology on residents without any sort of public outreach, particularly after last summer's protests against unaccountable policing.
- 
- "The NYPD is turning New Yorkers into surveillance guinea pigs," Cahn said. "We keep hearing the same rhetoric from Mayor de Blasio that he believes in community based policing, but I don’t see any community that’s calling for these creepy robots."
- 
- Inquiries to the Mayor's Office were not returned.

- About this rating
- Since 2020, the New York Police Department (NYPD) has been using a unique tool to assist with crime scenes and emergencies: robot dog technology.
- Reports emerged in June 2020 of Boston Dynamics — the robotics company behind Digidog — selling it to organizations and even to police departments around the country. The Digidog, according to the NYPD, can be deployed in dangerous situations, and in emergencies to assess the safety of a possible crime scene, but many activists have raised privacy and civil rights concerns. The NYPD has already used it at crime scenes in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens.
- One person tweeted a video claiming it showed one such robot dog being used somewhere in New York City.
- 
- According to the NYPD, it is testing robot dogs to evaluate their capabilities against other models already being used by its emergency service unit and bomb squad.
- 
- "This dog is going to save lives, protect people, and protect officers and that's our goal," NYPD Technical Assistance Response Unit Inspector Frank Digiacomo told ABC7 News.
- The New York Post shared a video of the robot being deployed at a home invasion crime scene in a Bronx neighborhood. This drew the criticism of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who tweeted, “robotic surveillance ground drones are being deployed for testing on low-income communities of color with under-resourced schools.”
- 
- She added, “When was the last time you saw next-generation, world class technology for education, healthcare, housing, etc consistently prioritized for underserved communities like this?”
- Indeed, activists have raised concerns about the long term impact of such robot dogs. Relying on them to do police work could result in “implications for bias, mobile surveillance, hacking and privacy.” Furthermore, such robots could eventually be weaponized.
- We already covered how the U.S. Air Force was using robot dogs for security at one base in Florida.
- Since the news broke about Digidog, backlash only grew. On April 22, 2021, the contract with Boston Dynamics was terminated according to police officials, who added that the dog would be returned to the company. John Miller, the police department's deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said the lease for the dog was scheduled through August, but they changed the timeline after the robot became a “target” for people who he said had improperly used it to fuel arguments about race and surveillance.
- “People had figured out the catchphrases and the language to somehow make this evil,” Miller said.
- Given that the NYPD confirmed that such robot dogs are being used and tested around different neighborhoods in New York City, we rate this claim as “True.”
