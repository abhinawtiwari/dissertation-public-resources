- Having taken steps to ensure greater safety and security, Toyota today announces that The Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games has decided to resume operations of the e-Palette mobility vehicle within the Athletes' Village.
- Operations of mobility services were suspended in response to an incident that occurred at the Athletes’ Village on Thursday, August 26, 2021, when the e-Palette collided with a visually impaired pedestrian.
- To ensure safe and secure traffic flow at the Athletes’ Village, there are three crucial elements: pedestrians, vehicles, and infrastructure including guides. By analyzing this incident from the perspective of these three elements, together with the Organising Committee, Toyota has determined additional safety measures
- The pedestrian was a visually impaired person who was walking alone. When the pedestrian tried to cross the intersection, the individual came into contact with a vehicle passing through the intersection.
- When the vehicle was turning right, upon entering the intersection, it detected a person in the intersection and stopped. Then, after the operator confirmed conditions were safe, the operator started the vehicle, moving again towards the intersection. The operator checked the situation around the intersection and manually started to decelerate. The vehicle’s sensor detected a pedestrian coming towards the intersection and activated the automatic brakes. The operator also applied the emergency brakes. However, a collision occurred with the vehicle and the pedestrian before the vehicle managed to come to a complete stop.
- At the time of the collision, there were only two guide persons at the intersection. Given that there were no traffic signals, and especially in a situation like the Paralympics where there are a diverse range of people, it was not possible for guide persons to check the movements of all pedestrians and vehicles moving in multiple directions. In addition, there was not a sufficient mechanism for coordination between guides and vehicle operators.
- As a result, the pedestrian entering the intersection came into contact with the vehicle.
- Based on the thorough verification of these facts, Toyota, together with the Organising Committee, has determined that ensuring safety at an intersection without signals is not something that can be handled by pedestrians, operators, or guides alone. It is necessary for all three parties to work together.
- Therefore, the following measures are to be implemented, which will be continuously improved on a daily basis:
- The Organizing Committee will reiterate the specifics of the walking environment in the Athletes' Village and the rules for moving around in the Village at the Athletes' Team Leaders' Meeting and will do so at other opportunities.
- Toyota will increase the volume of the vehicles’ approach-warning sounds, improve system for manual driving, and educate operators in order to respond to the safety needs of the diverse range of people unique to the Paralympics. These include:
- Increasing the number of guides and enhancing the capacity. Specifically, for operations that appear to be the same as for the Olympic Games, guides should receive training to meet the diverse needs of pedestrians which are unique to the Paralympics. Examples include:
- After taking these measures, ensuring time for the training of on-site personnel, and conducting test runs, the Organising Committee determined mobility operations to be resumed from 3:00 pm on Tuesday, August 31, 2021.
- Toyota will continue to make improvements on a daily basis, even after the resumption of operations, until the closing of the Athletes’ Village for the Paralympic Games and will continue to cooperate with the Organizing Committee to ensure the safety and security of the athletes and other people involved in the Village.

- Japan’s Aramitsu Kitazono was left with cuts and bruises after being hit by the e-Palette vehicle at the athletes’ village
- Toyota has apologised for the “overconfidence” of a self-driving bus after it ran over a Paralympic judoka in the athletes’ village and said it would temporarily suspend the service.
- The Japanese athlete, Aramitsu Kitazono, will be unable to compete in his 81kg category this weekend after being left with cuts and bruises following the impact with the “e-Palette” vehicle. His injuries prompted a personal intervention from the president of Toyota, Akio Toyoda.
- “We are very sorry that the accident has made many people worried,” Toyoda said. “A vehicle is stronger than a person, so I was obviously worried about how they were. It shows that autonomous vehicles are not yet realistic for normal roads.”
- As part of its sponsorship of Tokyo 2020, Toyota has been showcasing its autonomous vehicles via a shuttle service, which has been running around the clock in the athletes’ village.
- On Thursday, however, one of the buses pulled away from a T-junction and drove through a pedestrian crossing while Kitazono, a visually impaired athlete, was walking across.
- Tokyo police said that vehicle operators had told them they “were aware that a person was there but thought [the person] would [realize that a bus was coming] and stop crossing the [street]”, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.
- On Friday, Toyoda apologised for the incident and said the use of the e-Palette buses would be temporarily suspended.
- Toyoda visited the site of the accident and also reviewed video footage of the incident. He admitted “there had been overconfidence” in the technology of autonomous driving.
- Kitozano’s coach, Yoshiyasu Endo, told the Japan Times that the 30-year-old athlete was recovering well. “He wanted to take good care of himself. We feel regret, but I think he is the most disappointed,” Endo said.
- Toyota said in a statement: “We will conduct our own thorough investigation into the cause of the accident, and we will continue to coordinate closely with the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to ensure that we prevent any incidents from occurring in the future.”

- Japanese judoka Aramitsu Kitazono suffered bruising to his head and body and is now unable to compete
- Toyota has been forced to suspend all self-driving vehicles at Tokyo 2020, after a bus ran over a visually impaired athlete at the Paralympic village, leaving him unable to compete at the Games.
- Japanese judoka Aramitsu Kitazono was hit by the turning vehicle on Thursday afternoon, while walking on a pedestrian crossing in the athlete village, with police confirming that the collision occurred shortly after the bus had stopped for another pedestrian.
- Kitazono was taken to a clinic in the village for his injuries, while the two operators on the bus and five passengers were not injured.
- Local media reported that the bus automatically stopped, but the operators pressed the start button as they did not expect the pedestrian to walk out onto the road.
- Tokyo 2020 said the athlete underwent "a full examination" and "no external injury was identified", but Kitazono pulled out of his men's 81kg match on Saturday due to his injuries, including bruising to his head and body.
- Toyota, a top-tier sponsor of Tokyo 2020, suspended the use of e-Palette autonomous electric buses running in the village on Friday, and its president Akio Toyoda issued an apology.
- "We are very sorry that the accident has made many people worried," Toyoda said in a YouTube video, adding that the collision occurred when the bus was moving at a speed of one to two kilometres per hour at a junction.
- “A vehicle is stronger than a person, so I was obviously worried about how they were,” he added, answering questions about the incident.
- Toyoda said the accident showed the difficulty for self-driving vehicles to operate during the Paralympics, with people there who are visually impaired or have other disabilities.
- “It shows that autonomous vehicles are not yet realistic for normal roads,” he said, conceding that "there was some overconfidence" in self-driving.
- "We would like to express our sincerest apologies to the individual that was injured due to this unfortunate collision and we wish them a speedy recovery," Toyota said in a statement. "We would also like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to those who use our mobility vehicles in the Athletes' Village."
- "We will conduct our own thorough investigation into the cause of the accident, and we will continue to coordinate closely with the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to ensure that we prevent any incidents from occurring in the future,"
- Kitazono's coach, Yoshiyasu Endo decided after speaking with the athlete and the doctor who treated him that he could not compete.
- "We feel regret, but I think he is the most disappointed," Endo said.

- Toyota suspended its fleet of battery-electric self-driving buses on Friday after an accident in the Tokyo Paralympic Games village injured an athlete.
- "We would like to express our sincerest apologies to the individual that was injured due to this unfortunate collision and we wish them a speedy recovery," Toyota said in a statement. "We would also like to apologize for any inconvenience caused to those who use our mobility vehicles in the Athletes' Village."
- A Toyota spokesperson told Insider a schedule for resuming e-Palette transportation has not been determined.
- Several Japanese news outlets identified the victim as Japanese Paralympic judoka Aramitsu Kitazono, who is visually impaired. The e-Palette bus was turning right at an T-intersection when the athlete entered a pedestrian crosswalk at a T-intersection near the Olympic residential dining halls, Reuters said.
- Though there were operators providing backup support for the bus, Kitazono was struck by the bus moving one to two kilometers per hour, leaving him with several bruises but conscious, and he was taken to the nearby medical clinic to recover, police told the Japan Times. The two bus operators and five passengers onboard the bus were not harmed, they added.
- Toyota's e-Palette buses were commissioned to transport athletes both at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. The white, box-shaped buses are mostly autonomous, they still rely on one to two operators to ensure additional safety. The city began rolling out the vehicles for public testing months before the Olympic Games.
- Toyota says it will be fully cooperating with authorities to determine the cause of the accident, as well as conducting its own thorough investigation into the accident, coordinating with the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to prevent further accident.
- "It shows that autonomous vehicles are not yet realistic for normal roads," Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in an interview, which Reuters reported, following the accident.
- Autonomous vehicles continue to display glaring safety problems that can effect the well-being of their passengers. Though mobility-facing companies are making headway with self-driving vehicles, industry leaders like Elon Musk say their technology is still "not great."
- Experts previously told Insider that we are still "decades away" from seeing fully-autonomous vehicles on roads, citing infrastructure and connectivity issues. It is also unknown whether these types of vehicles have difficulty operating in environments when there are people with disabilities around.
- Insider reached out to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which was unable to provide more information on the athlete's status.

- A visually impaired Paralympian has been left with injuries that will take about two weeks to heal after being hit by a Toyota Motor Corp. autonomous bus running in the athletes' village, police said Friday.
- The Paralympian, Japanese judoka Aramitsu Kitazono, competing in the men's 81-kilogram division, will miss his match scheduled for Saturday, his coach said.
- The bus was turning right at an intersection in the village in Tokyo when it hit the 30-year-old who was walking on a pedestrian crossing around 2 p.m. on Thursday, the police said.
- Developed by Toyota Motor, e-Palette autonomous electric buses were running in the village around the clock. Just before the accident, the bus stopped after its sensor detected a security guard who was close to the intersection, according to the police.
- "We are very sorry that the accident has made many people worried," Toyota President Akio Toyoda told an internet program run by the automaker.
- Toyoda said the collision occurred when the bus was moving at a speed of 1 to 2 kilometers per hour, trying to turn right at the T junction.
- "There was some overconfidence" in autonomous driving, Toyoda said, adding he visited the junction and also checked the video footage of the accident.
- The collision, which left Kitazono with bruises on his head and body, is believed to have occurred shortly after it moved again with the help of an operator on the vehicle, the police said.
- The two operators and five passengers on the bus at the time were not injured, according to the police.
- Kitazono, who has qualified for the Paralympics for the third time, was on his way to a dining hall by himself and fell to the ground after the collision, people with knowledge of the matter said, adding he was taken to a clinic in the village.
- The organizing committee of the Summer Games said the judoka has no external wounds, while his coach, Yoshiyasu Endo, said he is resting and eating without problems.
- "He also wanted to take good care of himself. We feel regret, but I think he is the most disappointed," Endo said.
- Athletes competing in judo at the Paralympics are classified into three classes, from B1, total blindness to B3, low vision. He competes in the B2 group.
- Toyota, a top-tier sponsor of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, said the use of e-Palette vehicles in the village has been suspended, and it is "fully cooperating" with the police in investigating the cause of the accident.
- "We will conduct our own thorough investigation into the cause of the accident, and we will continue to coordinate closely with the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to ensure that we prevent any incidents from occurring in the future," the automaker said in a statement.
- Following a one-year postponement, the Paralympics, the world's biggest sporting event for athletes with disabilities, started Tuesday in Tokyo.

- The e-Palette is an electric, self-driving shuttle.
- Toyota has announced an immediate halt to its all-electric, self-driving e-Palette shuttles—the autonomous buses that had been ferrying athletes and staff around the Olympic Village—after it collided with a visually-impaired Japanese athlete last Thursday.
- The vehicles had been specially designed to cater to the needs of both olympians and paralympians, utilizing Level 4 self-driving technology. The buses were aimed at showing the carbon neutral future of the automaker’s mobility services. In 2015, Toyota signed an 8-year contract to supply electrified transportation for the Olympics and Paralympics reportedly valued at around $1 billion.
- According to local news reports, the e-Palette had only just left a bus-stop and the village and was moving at between 1 to 2 mph when it collided with a visually-impaired judo athlete Arimitsu Kitazono, knocking him down and injuring his legs and hands. After medical treatment at the site clinic, the athlete was apparently able to walk back to their accommodation but had to withdraw from his match on Saturday.
- In what is claimed to be Japan’s first-ever autonomous vehicle related accident, the report says the athlete was attempting to cross the road at a crosswalk when he accidentally walked into the side of the self-driving bus that had just started to move.
- “It shows that autonomous vehicles are not yet realistic for normal roads,” Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda commented after the accident. “We would like to express our sincerest apologies to the athlete who was injured due to this unfortunate accident and wish them a speedy recovery,” Toyota said.
- The e-Palette shuttle is fitted with 5 Lidar (laser imaging, detection and ranging) units that detect people and obstacles on all four sides of the vehicle. This allows it to pick up movement in a full 360-degree circle around the shuttle. If the Lidar units detect obstacles or pedestrians, the technology is set up to stop the vehicle immediately. Or at least, that’s the theory. So what happened?
- To maintain the utmost safety levels, even though the vehicles are autonomously driven, Toyota insisted that two ‘overseers’ ride onboard at all times to assist wheelchair and other paralympians get on and off and manage vehicle movement. One of these overseers had apparently just pushed the button to restart the e-Palette, thinking that an athlete approaching a crosswalk would stop and wait to cross as the vehicle had just left the bus-stop and was making a right turn. But the overseer failed to realize the extent of the athlete’s visual impairment, and that the athlete did not see the bus at all. The bus at that time was for the shortest moment, under manual control. So, from this information, it would appear that the cause of the accident was human error.
- While one former Japanese government official criticized Toyota suggesting that it stop dragging its feet with electric vehicle popularization, and that Akio Toyoda should concentrate more on his duties rather than appearing so flamboyantly on television, many local media outlets were quick to point out the ‘human error’ aspect of this accident and that the true causes needed to be found before any finger pointing started.
- Toyota is cooperating with police to determine the exact cause of the accident and will also launch its own probe.

- Aug 27 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor (7203.T) said on Friday it had suspended all self-driving e-Palette transportation pods at the Tokyo Paralympic Games village, a day after one of the vehicles collided with and injured a visually impaired pedestrian.
- In a YouTube video, Toyota Chief Executive Akio Toyoda apologized for the incident and said he offered to meet the person but was unable to do so.
- “A vehicle is stronger than a person, so I was obviously worried about how they were,” he said, answering questions about the incident.
- Toyoda said the accident showed the difficulty for the self-driving vehicle to operate in the special circumstances of the village during the Paralympics with people there who are visually impaired or have other disabilities.
- “It shows that autonomous vehicles are not yet realistic for normal roads,” he said.
- The vehicle had stopped at a T junction and was about to turn under manual control of the operator, who was using the vehicle's joystick control, when the vehicle hit the athlete going at around 1 or 2 kilometres an hour, Toyoda said. He said Paralympic officials had told him that the athlete, who remained conscious, was taken to the athlete village medical centre for treatment and was able to walk back to their residence.
- The athlete is due to compete on Saturday at 1030 local time, Toyoda said.
- The e-Palette, a fully autonomous battery-electric vehicle, was adapted specifically for use during the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, with large doors and electric ramps to allow groups of athletes to board quickly.
- The company said it was cooperating with a local police probe to determine the cause of the accident, adding that it would also conduct its own investigation.
- In its statement, the Japanese automaker said it would continue to coordinate closely with the Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to prevent any further incidents.
- Paralympic Games organizers were not immediately available for comment.
- The 2020 Paralympic Games began on Tuesday in Tokyo, even as Japan struggles with its worst COVID-19 outbreak, with record daily cases and an overwhelmed medical system.  read more

- The self-driving bus service used to transport athletes and staff at the Tokyo 2020 Games was suspended after an accident injuring a visually-impaired Paralympian.
- Japanese carmaker Toyota announced it will restart the use of its self-driving buses at the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games village on Tuesday after one of the vehicles hit a visually-impaired athlete last week.
- Japanese judoka Aramitsu Kitazono was knocked down by the "e-Palette" autonomous transportation pod as he walked to a dining hall at the athletes' village in Tokyo last Thursday. The vehicle was under human control at the time of the accident, Toyota's CEO said.
- In a statement released on Monday, the company said the Games' Organising Committee had decided to restart operations after making changes to "ensure the safety of the diverse range of people who make up the Paralympic community".
- The safety changes put in place by Toyota will take away many of the self-driving elements of the e-Palette, handing full control of the autonomous pod's acceleration, deceleration and stopping over to a human driver. The vehicle's warning alerts have also been made louder, the company said.
- Toyota's statement also included the company's assessment of the accident, which athlete Kitazono was able to walk away from.
- According to Toyota, the autonomous vehicle was about to turn right at a T-junction in the Tokyo Olympic village when it detected a person at the roadside and stopped.
- The vehicle's human operator then began to move the e-Palette again. At this point, Toyota said, Kitazono - who has reduced vision as a result of a genetic condition - stepped out into the road and was hit by the vehicle.
- The accident occurred despite the fact that two guides were on duty at the pedestrian crossing, Toyota said.
- According to the statement, Olympic Village staff will also receive road safety training before the autonomous vehicles resume operations at 3 pm local time on Thursday.
- Following the accident last week, Toyota Chief Executive Akio Toyoda apologised for the incident on YouTube, saying “a vehicle is stronger than a person, so I was obviously worried about how they were".
- Toyoda said the accident showed the difficulty for the self-driving vehicle to operate in the special circumstances of the village during the Paralympics with people there who are visually impaired or have other disabilities.
- “It shows that autonomous vehicles are not yet realistic for normal roads,” he said.
- The e-Palette, a fully autonomous battery-electric vehicle, was adapted specifically for use during the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, with large doors and electric ramps to allow groups of athletes to board quickly.
- Toyota has said it is cooperating with a local police probe to determine the cause of the accident, adding that it would also conduct its own investigation.
