- Riders for meal delivery company Deliveroo have been holding strikes in London and cities across the UK to protest against the company's poor pay, safety, and workers' rights record.
- The strike coincides Deliveroo public listing on London's stock exchange. The largest IPO in London since 2011, the company's stock price fell 26% on its first day due to concerns about employment conditions and the outsize control given to Deliveroo founder Will Shu also played a part.
- The listing was described by a banker as 'the worst IPO in London's history'.
- The UK's top court recently ruled that Uber drivers should be classified as 'workers' rather than 'self-employed', raising significant questions about Deliveroo's business model.
- In January 2021, an Italian court ruled that a 'secretive' algorithm used by Deliveroo to rank and offer shifts to riders in Italy was discriminatory.

- Deliveroo riders have gone on strike today over their rights - as the food transport company's disastrously performing shares begin unconditional trading.
- The action by the Independent Workers of Great Britain union could not come as a worse time as stock plummeted after they went on sale last week.
- Deliveroo's shares originally estimated the company to be worth up to £8.8billion, but when selling started they plummeted to more than £3billion shy of that sum.
- Retail investors - including thousands of loyal customers - had bought in at £3.90 a share, but today the stock market opened with them worth just £2.80.
- It came as members of the IWGB union prepared to go on strike in London, Wolverhampton, Reading, York and Sheffield.
- Placards made in Deliveroo's colours that list a set of 'demands' were seen being held by workers at the London strike.
- It understood the riders want: To combat sexual harassment and discrimination at work; to introduce transparent human rider support; to introduce active bystander training; to allow riders to refuse on safe work without penalty.
- Vice-chair of the courier's branch Wave Roberts, 24, said of their demands: 'They are very simple: pay, rights and safety.
- 'Essentially riders want more security around their pay, at least minimum wage pay guarantee and the fees to increase dramatically. They want rights, they want an end to end fair terminations, they want to know they will be fairly treated.
- Deliveroo riders have gathered for a strike in protest over their working conditions at different locations in London
- Placards made in Deliveroo's colours that list a set of 'demands' were seen being held by workers at the London strike. They range from a ban on discrimination at work to protections for refusing to carry out work
- The group carried flags and flares as they rode through London on bikes earlier today
- Riders for app-based meal delivery platform Deliveroo demonstrate outside the companies headquarters in London today
- Hundreds of people on bikes - flanked by bikers on scooters - took part in the demonstration today
- They also rode along on mopeds - synonymous with the gig economy - as they held signs aloft demanding better rights for workers
- The groups - some wearing their bike helmets - chanted and held their flags aloft - alongside pictures of the company's owner Will Shu
- Some wore their Deliveroo jackets and backpacks as they rode through London to demonstrate earlier today
- 'In some of our dense areas I am certain there will be a dense impact.
- 'We have members in the hundreds but I am not allowed to divulge exact numbers.
- 'Customers like to buy into an ethical story. If they know people behind the product, behind the service are treated well and looked after that's a way to buy in on its own,' he added to Radio 4.
- Founder Will Shu, 41, who was the company's first rider and still does regular delivery shifts on his bike, was expected to make £500million from the biggest float for a decade.
- It had been trumpeted as London's biggest listing for a decade, raising around £1billion to fund the company's expansion efforts.
- And Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, had even hailed Deliveroo's decision to go public in London as a 'true British tech success story'.
- Hundreds of workers turned out to the event in central London - as they demonstrated outside the company's head office
- Shares at the company were being sold to customers through the app before they floated
- Deliveroo claim the views of the union do not represent the vast majority of its 50,000 self-employed riders in Britain, adding job satisfaction levels was at an all-time high, and that flexibility was a big attraction.
- A spokesperson said: 'This small self appointed union does not represent the vast majority of riders who tell us they value the total flexibility they enjoy while working with Deliveroo alongside the ability to earn over £13 an hour.
- 'Only today we ran a survey and 88% of riders said that they were happy with the company and flexibility was their priority.
- 'We are proud that rider satisfaction is at an all-time high and that thousands of people are applying to be Deliveroo riders each and every week.
- 'Riders are at the heart of our business and today we are beginning a new consultation with riders about how we should invest our new £50m community fund.'
- Deliveroo's founder Will Shu is still expected to be out on his bike delivering food for the company today.
- Most entrepreneurs about to take home approaching half a billion pounds would have already have put money down on a mansion or a super car.
- But the notoriously private entrepreneur, 41, will probably treat today like any other, spending the day at his terraced house in Notting Hill, or at his office in the City, eating breakfast, lunch and dinner all ordered through the Deliveroo app.
- Mr Shu, a self-confessed geeky American who moved to the UK to work for JP Morgan, founded the company in 2013 after being forced to eat Tesco sandwiches and salads during late shifts working as a banker in Canary Wharf.
- Today he runs Britain's third largest takeaway delivery company, behind Uber Eats and Just Eat, having been Deliveroo's first rider eight years ago.
- The American-born entrepreneur is described by friends as 'incredibly intense' and 'obsessed' with the business and food.  But despite his wealth and business success, he is believed to have been single for some, if not all, of his time at the helm.
- Mr Shu, who says he is a 'good tipper' to the riders who bring his three meals a day by bike or car, still works at least once a week on his bike - but despite his frontline experience his business remains dogged by claims it fails to pay and treat its delivery staff properly.
- CEO of Deliveroo William Shu still goes out on his bike for the company that is set to make him £500m
- Yesterday, just 48 hours before launching on the London Stock Exchange, Deliveroo's maximum potential market valuation fell from £8.8billion to £7.9bn over the issue. But there is still huge interest in the firm, which has never made a profit despite booming sales in lockdown.
- It came after two of Britain's biggest investors will refuse to buy shares in Deliveroo when it launches on the stock market next month because of concerns about how they treat staff.
- At the centre of the controversy is the company's classification of its riders as 'self-employed', meaning they are not entitled to minimum wage, holiday pay or sick leave.
- Investors say they have been spooked by the issue, which could cost the company huge sums after Uber agreed to pay their drivers more and give them the same rights as employees after a series of court cases.
- Shu is set to offer the group's most prolific riders up to £10,000 in cash each following the IPO, and customers are also being offered the chance to buy £50million in shares in multiples of £250.
- Such is the entrepreneur's dedication to the business - and love of restaurant food - he orders breakfast, lunch and dinner through Deliveroo.
- Mr Shu's first office was a 'death trap' in Maylebone, shared with a company called ISIS and cable channel Gem TV
- Although he loves ordering from KFC and Nando's, Will does tend to order 'regimented' meals.
- These include boiled eggs for breakfast, chicken and broccoli for lunch and a salad for dinner from restaurants around his west London home to help avoid piling on the pounds.
- Mr Shu was born to Taiwanese parents in Connecticut in 1979. After getting a degree from Northwestern University he joined JP Morgan, first working in New York and then moving to their London headquarters.
- It was there, while wandering Canary Wharf's mall at night looking for restaurant quality meals, that he cooked up the idea for Deliveroo, setting up the firm and becoming its first rider.
- He founded the business with his childhood friend Greg Orlowski, a software engineer who designed the app. Orlowski quit five years ago to spend more time with his daughter in Chicago, but he and Mr Shu remain friends.
- Shu and Orlowski set up shop in a 'death trap' office in Marylebone shared with a company called ISIS and cable channel Gem TV.
- The laid back and shy businessman's, soon to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds, was known for his scruffy clothes and wearing a T-shirt and shorts all year round.
- One colleague said: 'He may have been the only founder who pitched us wearing shorts.
- 'He wore shorts for the first four years I worked with him, regardless of the weather or the occasion.'
- Another said: 'I've seen him do every job in the company - from being a rider to doing customer service to signing up restaurants.
- 'His job is incredibly intense and he obsesses over it, but he's always down to earth and has a laugh'.
- After leaving their first office, they set up their headquarters on the banks of the Thames.
- Staff are encouraged to dress casually, with Shu keeping the T-shirt but swapping the shorts for smarter chinos.
- In line with many tech firms, the building has plenty of sofas to flop on during the day and even a leisure area with games and a basketball court.
- Jaegermeister is available for the staff if they want it, while office chairs are swapped for casual 'swinging seats'.

- LONDON (AP) — Riders for the app-based meal delivery platform Deliveroo held a strike in London Wednesday over pay and working conditions, part of a broader backlash against one of the U.K.’s biggest gig economy companies.
- Scooter and bicycle delivery riders waving flags and red smoke flares rode through the streets of Central London. Socially distanced protests were also planned in York, Reading, Sheffield and Wolverhampton to demand fair pay, safety protections and basic workers’ rights.
- The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain, which represents migrant and gig workers, expected hundreds of riders to take part.
- Deliveroo said that “this small self-appointed union does not represent the vast majority of riders who tell us they value the total flexibility they enjoy.” Rider surveys found most are happy with the company and flexibility was their priority, the company said in a statement.
- The strike coincides with the first day of unconditional share trading for Deliveroo, which went public last week in a multibillion pound stock offering that was one of Europe’s most hotly anticipated IPOs this year. However, a number of institutional investors skipped the initial public offering, citing concerns about employment conditions for riders and a dual-class shareholder structure that gives founder Will Shu outsize control.
- The company, which operates in a dozen countries in Europe, the Mideast and Asia, saw its business boom over the past year because of COVID-19 restrictions that powered demand for meal deliveries. More than 6 million customers order through its app each month and the company promised some longtime riders bonuses from the IPO.
- However, riders say they haven’t been sharing in the success because the company has been paying them less.
- The “success they claim to have had during the pandemic was built on our backs,” said Wave Roberts, a Deliveroo rider in Reading and vice chair of the union’s couriers branch. “It’s not sustainable. It’s got to the point where they’ve hired too many people. They’ve lowered the fees too much.”
- Deliveroo and other gig companies in the U.K. that rely on flexible workforces are also facing looming regulatory challenges, after the U.K.’s top court ruled Uber drivers should be classed as “workers” and not self-employed, entitling them to benefits such as minimum wage and pensions.

- UK Deliveroo riders are refusing to work as part of a pay and conditions protest, hours after unconditional trading in the company's shares began following last week's troubled flotation.
- Strike organisers the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said hundreds were expected to attend socially-distanced protests - underway in London, York, Reading, Sheffield and Wolverhampton.
- The union said they want the living wage, safety protections and rights including access to holiday and sick pay, an end to unpaid waiting times, and the right to refuse unsafe work without penalty.
- It comes after the Bureau of Investigative Journalism analysed invoices from more than 300 riders over the past year, concluding that one in three made less than £8.72 an hour - the minimum wage for those aged over 25 - with some earning as little as £2 per hour.
- Ahead of the strike, Alex Marshall, IWGB president and former bicycle courier, said: "Deliveroo presents a false choice between flexibility and basic rights but the Uber ruling showed that here as well as abroad, workers can have both.
- "That is the least they deserve and what the public expects for our frontline workers.
- "They said it couldn't be done but by getting organised and speaking out, riders have triggered a domino effect which already slashed £3bn from Deliveroo's valuation and that should give pause to any corporation that thinks precarious workers can be endlessly exploited without consequence.
- Deliveroo hops to Asda expansion in grocery drive
- Deliveroo to cut hundreds of jobs globally - and UK to be worst hit
- Man died after eating pizza ordered through Deliveroo as parents demand 'full truth'
- "It's time for Deliveroo to do the right thing, recognise its riders as workers and treat them like human beings."
- The union told Sky News it had "hundreds" of Deliveroo riders as paid-up members.
- It was expected to update reporters later in the day on the numbers taking part in the strike, as images of apparent pickets began to emerge on social media though little, if any, disruption was expected for deliveries.
- There are up to 50,000 people on the company's books.
- Deliveroo said it surveyed 8,500 riders this week and almost 90% were satisfied working for the company.
- A Deliveroo spokesperson said: "This small self appointed union does not represent the vast majority of riders who tell us they value the total flexibility they enjoy while working with Deliveroo alongside the ability to earn over £13 an hour.
- "Only today (Tuesday) we ran a survey and 88% of riders said that they were happy with the company and flexibility was their priority.
- "We are proud that rider satisfaction is at an all-time high and that thousands of people are applying to be Deliveroo riders each and every week.
- "Riders are at the heart of our business and today we are beginning a new consultation with riders about how we should invest our new £50m community fund."
- The strike comes as unconditional trading in the company's shares began - with values rising 3% in early deals on Wednesday as restrictions on sales were ended and members of the public were able to buy them.
- The stock was trading at 288p - still well below the 390p offer price last week.
- Last week's debut was widely regarded as a flop, with shares slumping as much as 30%, wiping more than £2bn off the company's initial £7.6bn valuation - just over a week after it was estimated at up to £8.8bn.
- Some of the City's biggest institutional investors had shunned the initial public offering (IPO) over concerns about Deliveroo's working practices and the dual-class share structure which gives founder Will Shu greater control.
- The failure left the company and its bookrunners red-faced and big question marks hanging over the City's flotation ambitions.
- Neil Wilson, chief markets analyst at Markets.com, said of the rise in the price on Wednesday: "I'm not sure if this is a vote of confidence or a case of averaging in, but it's no doubt a big relief to management and the bankers involved that the retail army has not routed at the first sound of gunfire.
- "Given the wipe-out that has already taken place, I think a lot of investors will simply think that it cannot go any lower and it's worth holding on for a better price."

- Deliveroo drivers reveal the human cost of Will Shu’s ambition to become Britain’s food delivery king
- On a bitterly cold April morning, Deliveroo riders gather outside a KFC in Reading’s Broad Street to strike against their working conditions.
- Among the organisers is 24-year-old Wave Roberts who has been riding with Deliveroo for three years. In that time, Roberts says they’ve steadily seen their pay packet shrink.
- Meanwhile, Roberts’ boss Will Shu, has watched the value of his stake in the eight-year-old company grow to $474m (£345m).
- “When I started working for Deliveroo, you would get anywhere from £4.20 on average,” Roberts says. “With inflation and living costs going up, you would have expected that to go up. But now, delivery fees could be anywhere from £2.70 to £3.15.”
- Fees are set before riders agree to take on a delivery. The app predicts how long the ride will take and how long it will take food to be prepared.
- Deliveroo also uses an algorithm that determines which riders get work offers, based on their distance to the job and the number of riders logged in to the app, in an effort to cut order times.
- But some riders have claimed this can mean hourly uncertainty over what they will take home and how much work they will do. Many have also complained over safety measures and support provided by the company.
- “What we want is transparency,” says Roberts. “We want to know how our pay is calculated and decided. We want pay security and minimum wage, at least, our workers rights and transparency over the algorithm.”
- Roberts isn’t alone. Hundreds of Deliveroo couriers on Wednesday took to the streets of London York, Sheffield, Reading and Wolverhampton, in protest over their treatment at the company.
- Outside Deliveroo’s headquarters in the City of London, they unfurled banners, shouted through megaphones and released red smoke flares.
- Striking @Deliveroo riders in London ✊🔥✊🔥 pic.twitter.com/tJ92GRwduk
- The food delivery company, which went public last week, saw many of its shares begin trading on Wednesday. On its opening day, shares fell by as much as 30pc after some investors turned down the opportunity amid concerns over workers rights and the future of the so-called “gig economy”.
- A report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, published with the Independent Workers of Great Britain Union (IWGB), claimed that in one case a Deliveroo rider received as little as £2 per hour.
- It found that even for riders who have earned above the minimum wage rate on average, expenses mean much of their earnings is lost. Ian Morrison, 29, from West Norwood in London, for instance told the Bureau that despite earning around £12 an hour, a third of his earnings are spent on  expenses such as petrol, insurance and loan payments on a scooter.
- Deliveroo has disputed the claims of low pay by the IWGB, saying its riders can make over £13 per hour. It adds that the union’s calculations were based on time logged into its app, not on the time riders were working on deliveries.
- A Deliveroo spokesman said of the protests: “This small self appointed union does not represent the vast majority of riders who tell us they value the total flexibility they enjoy while working with Deliveroo alongside the ability to earn over £13 an hour.
- “Only yesterday we ran a survey and 89pc of riders said that they were happy with the company and flexibility was their priority.
- “We are proud that rider satisfaction is at an all-time high and that thousands of people are applying to be Deliveroo riders each and every week. Riders are at the heart of our business and today we are beginning a new consultation with riders about how we should invest our new £50 million community fund.”
- But riders say the uneven nature of the work provided by Deliveroo has made it harder to make a living from delivering takeaways and groceries during the pandemic.
- Greg Howard, a 33-year-old dad, works for Deliveroo and is chair of the IWGB’s couriers branch. He was forced off work with Covid and left with little means to support his family.
- Howard calls Deliveroo’s payment system “dystopian… a black box… no one knows what’s inside, all we know is that we work every day not knowing what we’ll earn or even how it’s decided. The precarity and the anxiety is completely unjustifiable.”
- “Trying to support a family under these conditions often feels like an impossible task.”
- Jamie Taylor, a Deliveroo rider from Reading, calculates that over 150 invoices he was paid £7.60, or £6.84 after expenses.
- Deliveroo riders are only paid a flat fee for each delivery they make, not for the time they are logged into the app. They are able to reject or accept these at will, and are able to use substitutes. The company says this means they are in effect contractors. Because they are not classed as workers, they are not entitled to sick or holiday pay.
- “Flexibility has become a weapon Deliveroo wields whenever anyone complains about working conditions. Flexibility and job security aren’t mutually exclusive," says Taylor.
- He adds that working through its app, with pay determined by software, is demoralising. “It doesn’t feel good. A lot of people feel there is a lack of respect between them and the company.”
- Such issues are not just the subject of picket line protests. Ahead of Deliveroo’s float, a campaign by the union and activists ShareAction to raise awareness over rider complaints saw several major funds decline to participate in the deal. Aviva and Aberdeen Standard both pointed to employment issues as an investment risk.
- Deliveroo went public at a share price of 390p on March 31, but it quickly dropped to around 280p. That initially valued Deliveroo at £7.6bn, but its market cap was cut to just over £5bn.
- In its listing documents, Deliveroo warned that concerns over workers rights could “adversely affect our financial condition as well as our reputation”. The company has faced legal action in the UK, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Italy.
- In the UK, it has successfully defended the status of its riders in arbitration, arguing they cannot collectively bargain due to their self-employed status. Its riders are currently contesting that decision in the Court of Appeal.
- But in Italy, for instance, it faces being forced to backdate minimum wage pay, paid holidays, sick leave and severance as far back as September 2015. It is appealing the decision.
- Activists point to the Supreme Court’s decision to class Uber drivers as workers as a key step in transforming how gig economy workers are treated, although Deliveroo rejects the comparison of their work status.
- Alex Marshall, President of the IWGB and a former courier, says: “Deliveroo presents a false choice between flexibility and basic rights, but the Uber ruling showed that here as well as abroad, workers can have both.”
- Meanwhile, rivals such as Just Eat have applied pressure to Deliveroo by swapping some of their riders status to that of paid workers. Just Eat now claims to have 2,000 such riders, although others are self-employed and work directly for its restaurants.
- Deliveroo pushed back on concerns about its working practices. It says it is setting up a £50m community fund and will work with riders on how this is used. It also says it offered regular riders a share of a £16m thank you fund on its initial public offering.  It also says its fee per order has increased year-on-year, on average between £4 and £5 per order.
- Riders such as Roberts, who is also an IWGB member, are not satisfied, they are angry. “We were classified as key workers, but were we treated like key workers no? No. I know couriers who were doing their jobs day in and day out and who caught Covid. There are some riders not able to pay their rent.”
- Roberts adds that many drivers got nothing from Deliveroo’s riders fund.
- “Deliveroo brought out their thank you fund and said they were giving some riders £10,000. But I’ve worked for Deliveroo for three years and done an awful lot of orders and do you know what I got? Nothing. I got an email saying thank you for your hard work. I guess that makes up for everything.”

- Hundreds of Deliveroo riders across the UK are refusing to make deliveries in protest of poor pay and work conditions, as the company begins its first day of trading on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
- Deliveroo riders organised under the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) went on strike on 7 April 2021 to demand a guaranteed living wage; an end to over-hiring and unpaid waiting times, as well as holiday and sick pay.
- Riders are also demanding that Deliveroo provides better safety at work, more transparency over its fees and algorithms, agrees to collective bargaining, and sets up a fair process for terminations.
- “I’m going on strike for my basic rights and those of all the other riders struggling to get by and support families on Deliveroo poverty pay. I’ve seen conditions decline for years, and working through lockdown I contracted Covid-19 and got very little support from Deliveroo,” said Deliveroo rider and chair of the IWGB’s Couriers & Logistics Branch, Greg Howard.
- “After the pandemic, more people than ever understand this exploitation is no way to treat anyone, let alone key workers. The turning of the tide is clear. It’s time for rights for riders.”
- The strike action is taking place in York, Sheffield, Reading and Wolverhampton, and includes a staged ‘ride-along’ through London to the firm’s HQ.
- It follows an analysis of 300 rider invoices by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which revealed that Deliveroo pays one in three riders less than £8.72 an hour – the national minimum wage for over 25s – and some as little as £2 an hour.
- These findings, which were made public on 23 March, pre-empted Deliveroo’s initial public offering (IPO), which was targeting a market capitalisation of £8.8bn.
- Following UK fund managers Aviva Investors and Aberdeen Standard announcing in late March that they will not buy Deliveroo shares ahead of its IPO because of concerns over workers’ rights, a number of other investment firms – including BMO Global, CCLA, Legal & General, Rathbones and Hargreaves Lansdown – also indicated that they will not be investing in the company.
- Although Deliveroo’s float is still London’s biggest IPO since mining giant Glencore went public in 2011, it is widely regarded as a flop after shares slumped as much as 30% and its overall valuation plummeted to £5.5bn.
- Since the UK Supreme Court ruled on 19 February that Uber must reclassify its drivers as workers rather than self-employed individuals, other platforms operating in the gig economy have come under increasing pressure to do the same for their own couriers and riders.
- As a result of the decision, Uber’s workers are now entitled to be paid the national minimum wage, to receive statutory minimum holiday pay and rest breaks, as well as protection from unlawful discrimination and whistleblowing – although Uber has since diverged from the court’s interpretation that drivers should be paid from when they log in, not just when passengers are on board.
- “Deliveroo presents a false choice between flexibility and basic rights, but the Uber ruling showed that here as well as abroad, workers can have both. That is the least they deserve and what the public expects for our frontline workers,” said IWGB president and former bicycle courier Alex Marshall ahead of the strike.
- “They said it couldn’t be done, but by getting organised and speaking out, riders have triggered a domino effect which already slashed £3bn from Deliveroo’s valuation, and that should give pause to any corporation that thinks precarious workers can be endlessly exploited without consequence. It’s time for Deliveroo to do the right thing, recognise its riders as workers and treat them like human beings.”
- In response to the strikes, Deliveroo said it had surveyed 8,500 riders on 6 April, claiming nearly nine in 10 responded that they were satisfied working for the company.
- “This small self-appointed union does not represent the vast majority of riders who tell us they value the total flexibility they enjoy while working with Deliveroo alongside the ability to earn over £13 an hour,” said a Deliveroo spokesperson.
- “Only today (Tuesday) we ran a survey and 88% of riders said that they were happy with the company and flexibility was their priority. We are proud that rider satisfaction is at an all-time high and that thousands of people are applying to be Deliveroo riders each and every week.
- “Riders are at the heart of our business, and today we are beginning a new consultation with riders about how we should invest our new £50m community fund.”
- With up to 50,000 riders, it is unclear what percentage are currently refusing to make deliveries.
- However, in August 2020, the Centre for Employment Relations, Innovation and Change at Leeds University Business School found that, from an analysis of 527 gig economy-related protest incidents between 1 January 2017 and 20 May 2020, “the company with most incidents was Deliveroo, which accounted for more than a quarter of all protest events (28.5%)”.
- According to reports in the BCC, Deliveroo’s shares rose more than 2% to 286p on 7 April when the stock market opened up for retail investors, but are still well below the 390p offer price from a week earlier.

- Deliveroo (ROO.L) riders from the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) are taking industrial action on Wednesday against the company that has recently floated on the stock market, over issues of wages, safety protections and basic workers’ rights
- The move was meant to coincide with the company's shares officially being admitted to the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday following a period of "conditional" trading that began last week.
- "The strike fund raised almost £10,000 ($13,813) in just a few days last week and socially distanced protests are being organised in London, York, Sheffield, Reading, Wolverhampton," IWGB said.
- Supportive action is expected internationally in Australia, France, Netherlands, Ireland, and Spain. IWGB has even claimed "Deliveroo is now the world’s most protested app-based platform."
- Earlier, Deliveroo had cut its potential valuation, following a revolt from the City of London over the company's treatment of drivers. Several of the City of London's biggest money managers — including Aviva (AV.L), Aberdeen Standard Life (SLA.L), L&G (LGEN.L), and M&G (MNG.L) — publicly said they would not take part in Deliveroo's IPO.
- The money managers cited concerns over Deliveroo's treatment of drivers. Deliveroo's platform allows anyone to sign up as a rider to deliver food for restaurants. Analysis published by the Bureau for Investigative Journalism claimed that riders can earn as little as £2 an hour on the platform, which is well below minimum wage.
- Deliveroo disclosed in its IPO documents that it is facing legal claims or regulatory probes across much of Europe over the classification of its riders.
- "Deliveroo has also come under increasing pressure from parliament with large numbers of MPs from all parties backing the IWGB’s demands," the union said.

- Shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons Afzal Khan said on Twitter: "Solidarity with Deliveroo riders today, who are on strike with the @IWGBunion. 62% of riders in Manchester, Chester, Lancaster & Liverpool are paid below the national minimum wage Workers deserve better pay, rights & safety."
- Other MPs who tweeted their support included Kevin Brennan, Labour MP for Cardiff West, and Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Labour MP for Streatham.
- "The company’s main competitor Just Eat already declared its intention to abandon the gig economy model of ‘bogus self-employment.’ Other courier corporations have been compelled to do so by courts in the UK and victories against Deliveroo are being won in courts abroad," IWGB said.
- Greg Howard, Deliveroo rider and chair, couriers and logistics branch at IWGB, added: “I’m going on strike for my basic rights and those of all the other riders struggling to get by and support families on Deliveroo poverty pay.
- "I’ve seen conditions decline for years and then working through lockdown I contracted COVID-19 and got very little support from Deliveroo. After the pandemic more people than ever understand this exploitation is no way to treat anyone, let alone key workers."
- Alex Marshall, IWGB president said: “Deliveroo presents a false choice between flexibility and basic rights but the Uber ruling showed that here as well as abroad, workers can have both."
- Last month, Uber (UBER) said that it would reclassify its 70,000 UK drivers as workers. The reclassification doesn't entitle drivers to the same rights as employees but means they will be guaranteed minimum wage, sick pay, holidays, and will be entered into a pension plan. The shift followed a defeat for Uber in the UK's Supreme Court last month.
- Earlier, shares in Deliveroo rallied as unconditional trading began. Wednesday marked the first time retail investors could buy and sell shares in the company, including the 70,000 who invested money in Deliveroo's initial public offering.
- Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said the rally would be a "a big relief" to Deliveroo and the bankers that worked on its float. There were fears that retail investors could dump shares at the first opportunity, following last week's disastrous debut.
- However, Deliveroo's share price still remains well below its IPO price despite Wednesday's uptick. The company sold its shares at 390p-a-piece ahead of its official listing. The stock promptly fell 30% after debuting on the market last Wednesday in one of the worst London listings in history.

- As Deliveroo courier drivers strike for the third day running over proposals that could see them earn barely half the National Living Wage, the Government appears to have waded into the dispute with criticism of the food delivery company.
- Of the company's 3,000 cyclists and moped riders who deliver food parcels around London, 280 have been offered a trial which would reduce their hourly pay to as little as £3.75 during quieter periods - but with a pay guarantee should they receive less on the new payment model.
- And now the Department for Business has responded to the proposal, which is set to begin on Wednesday, by saying workers "have a right" to the NLW.
- Any change to that basic rate of pay could not be "simply opted out of" but would need to go through a formal court process before being reduced, said the Government.
- The stance would appear to add to the criticism leveled against Deliveroo from unions and the public about its treatment of its "independently contracted" staff.
- A spokesperson for the Department of Business, Energy and Industry Strategy (BEIS) said signing a "type of contract" was not justification enough for not paying the NLW).
- "The Government is determined to build an economy that works for all – that includes ensuring everyone gets a decent wage," said a statement from the BEIS.
- "An individual’s employment status is determined by the reality of the working relationship and not the type of contract they have signed. Individuals cannot opt out of the rights they are owed, nor can an employer decide not to afford individuals those rights.
- "Employers cannot simply opt out of the NLW by defining their staff as self-employed.”
- Deliveroo drivers took to the streets of central London on Thursday in the first day of strikes which protest against changes to their pay and conditions.
- An email sent around to all the workers with the company has told them they will be paid £3.75 per delivery instead of an hourly rate of £7 plus £1 per delivery for certain times of the day where deliveries are less popular. Couriers have pointed out that they are still waiting around in quiet periods should any jobs come through.
- The hourly rate already sees many of them earn less than the NLW – currently set at £7.20 for those aged over 25 – once travel expenses are accounted for, and distinctly less than the London Living Wage of £9.40, couriers have said.
- Deliveroo, which has raised $275m (£212m) from angel investors this month, has said it will enforce the pay terms from next week and claimed that couriers had responded positively in early trials. But a union which sprang up in 2015 to represent independently contracted couriers such as at Deliveroo and Uber has said workers were in fact reacting positively to having the obligation to always work two weekend evenings removed.
- Couriers had reportedly complained about being contractually obliged to always work weekend evenings, thereby allowing Deliveroo to say workers were happier with "piece rate" wages that were more flexible, said the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB).
- Margaret Dewhurst, chair of careers and logistics at IWGB, said the attempt to change a fixed hourly rate to a differing piece rate was intended to hold drivers at "arms length" from the company and ensure they still could not access basic workers' rights such as the NLW and holiday pay.
- "This new contract will help them more easily exploit people," she told The Independent. In terms of actual work, a piece rate is more advantageous to a company, because it means you can divvy up all the work and not treat people as proper employees.
- "They're basically saying that in quieter period the average amount of time drivers are working is 15 minutes in an hour. But you're still there to provide a service for the other 45 minutes. It's total bull***. It's very frustrating talking to the management at Deliveroo."
- She added that senior staff within Deliveroo had defended the practice by saying its workers were all "entrepreneurs". IWGB has said the majority are students, poorer workers, migrants and people supporting families.
- Deliveroo told The Independent: “This is not a wide-scale change and nothing is set in stone at this stage. The trial is taking place across five areas in London. The new payment model is based on payment per delivery, with riders receiving £3.75 per delivery. We have conducted similar trials in carefully selected areas that are busy enough to support this model and have seen riders earning as much as £15-18 per hour over a lunchtime.
- “This model also gives riders more flexibility, which we know is important to our riders. In our rider surveys, 60 per cent said that flexibility was the most important feature of the job and 85 per cent told us they see Deliveroo as a way to earn supplementary income or do short-term flexible work.
- “Listening to our riders is incredibly important to us. We’re calling everyone in the London trial to get their feedback and answer any questions they might have, and we’re hosting drop-in sessions at our London office. This was always built into the process from the beginning.
- “We absolutely respect their right to disagree with us. There have been no negative repercussions for any rider that voices criticism or participates in a protest about this – and that will always be the case.”
- The National Living Wage of £7.20 for everyone aged over 25 years old – hailed as the new minimum wage – was announced by then Chancellor George Osborne in April this year. Yet nearly 200 employers have been recently named and shamed for failing to pay that minimum wage to their workers.
- Meanwhile, Deliveroo has picked up $275m of investment in a boost that makes the food delivery group one of Europe's best-funded start-ups.
- Deliveroo workers said they will fight the contract in court if it goes ahead. The IWGB said court tribunals against City Sprint, Addison Lee, E-Courier and Excel are also being considered by workers over allegedly similar practices.

- At first glance, Deliveroo’s stock market debut should have been a runaway success. The food delivery startup was a darling of the UK tech scene, and growing fast thanks to surging demand during the pandemic. Amazon recently bought 16% of the company in a major vote of confidence.
- But London’s biggest IPO since 2011 was an unmitigated disaster. The stock plunged when trading started on Wednesday, and the shares eventually closed 26% below their listing price, wiping almost £2 billion ($2.8 billion) off Deliveroo’s initial market capitalization. The stock lost another 1.9% on Thursday.
- The opening day performance marks the worst London debut for a major IPO in at least two decades, according to data provider Dealogic. One of the company’s bankers told the Financial Times that it was “the worst IPO in London’s history.”
- Amazon-backed Deliveroo crashes in London IPO
- Why did investors shun Deliveroo when they couldn’t get enough of rivals including DoorDash, which soared 85% in its Wall Street debut last year? A host of factors were behind the flop, experts say, including pricing, timing, uncertain business prospects, concerns over how the company treats workers and increased regulatory risks facing gig economy companies.
- “The initial price was just incorrect,” said Alasdair Haynes, the CEO of Aquis Exchange, an upstart rival to the London Stock Exchange and the CBOE. “The people with egg on the face here are the advisers,” he added.
- JPMorgan Chase
            
                (JPM) and Goldman Sachs
            
                (GS) were the lead investment banking advisers on the IPO. JPMorgan declined to comment. Goldman Sachs
            
                (GS) did not respond to a request for comment.
- Citing “volatile global market conditions,” Deliveroo had set the IPO price at the very bottom of the range it was targeting, despite insisting that it had “very significant demand from institutions across the globe.” But even that was way too high for investors to stomach.
- While recent stock market jitters didn’t help, concerns about regulatory changes that could affect how gig economy companies pay their workers were a much bigger factor, said Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
- Several large institutional investors, including Aberdeen Standard Investments and BMO Global Asset Management, pointed to regulatory risk and the limited rights given to Deliveroo workers when they announced days before the IPO that they would not apply for shares.
- Deliveroo’s listing came just two weeks after Uber
            
                (UBER) decided to reclassify all its drivers — but not its food delivery couriers — as workers, a move that could force other gig economy companies to rethink how they operate.
- Why gig economy workers aren't cheering Uber's about-face just yet
- The decision followed a UK Supreme Court ruling that Uber drivers should be classified as workers, and not independent contractors, entitling them to minimum wage, paid vacation time and a pension.
- In light of the Uber ruling, Deliveroo’s practice of hiring riders as independent contractors with limited rights is “a significant financial risk for shareholders,” James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA, an asset manager for charities and religious organizations, said in a video commentary ahead of the listing.
- Forced pension contributions would compress Deliveroo’s already thin margins, added Lund-Yates.
- Deliveroo has yet to turn a profit, despite conditions being “as good as they have ever been” for a food delivery service, and it is losing money on most if not all deliveries, she added. “If you add that on top of the regulatory risk there’s a huge question over how margins get off the ground.”
- Investors also expressed concerns about future growth, especially as the United Kingdom exits lockdown and customers return to dining out in restaurants. Deliveroo also faces stiff competition from rivals Uber Eats and Just Eat Takeaway.
- “We find it very difficult to understand how we can value a company that has yet to turn a profit and yet where the forward looking perspective for the business opportunity is quite so uncertain,” said Bevan.
- Deliveroo founder and CEO Will Shu was upbeat about the company’s prospects on Wednesday, pointing to plans to invest in delivery-only kitchens and provide customers with more choice. “Our aim is to build the definitive online food company and we’re very excited about the future ahead,” he said in a statement.
- Deliveroo’s ownership structure may also have played a role in its icy stock market reception. It has two classes of shares, allowing its founder to retain control of the company following an IPO, which “may have been on the minds of some of the institutional investors,” according to Lund-Yates.
- Dual class shares are allowed on the London Stock Exchange but not for its premium segment, which provides the pool of blue-chip companies that make up indexes such as the FTSE 100
            
                (UKX). The UK government is considering removing that restriction, despite opposition from major institutional investors.
- How Britain could keep its 'crown' in finance and technology after Brexit
- “We have strong reservations about allowing dual class share structures into the premium segment,” head of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, Andrew Millington, said in a statement shared with CNN Business. “We believe that the high standards of the premium listing segment are important to provide protection and reassurance to the many millions of individuals who have their savings invested in these companies,” he added.
- But there’s more to the Deliveroo story. After all, many tech companies use the same structure. Brent Hoberman, the co-founder of Founders Factory, an accelerator that helps startups to grow, pointed to e-commerce company The Hut Group, whose shares soared in their London IPO last September, as an example.
- Dual class shares are also common in the United States and allowed on stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Singapore and China. They are also permitted in Amsterdam, which has overtaken London as Europe’s top share trading center following Brexit.
- The Deliveroo disaster could deal another blow to London, and its renewed efforts to attract more tech company listings.
- Brexit has forced banks to relocate some activity away from London, putting its undisputed position as the region’s top financial capital at risk.
- Finance Minister Rishi Sunak, who earlier hailed Deliveroo as a “true British tech success story,” was forced to defend the company’s stock market performance on Wednesday during an interview with broadcaster ITV.
- Brexit leaves London fighting for its future as Europe poaches business
- “Share prices go up, share prices go down … It’s important businesses like that feel that they can stay in the UK to raise capital,” he said.
- That’s likely to be of little consolation to the 70,000 retail investors who took part in the IPO — buying shares worth £50 million ($68.9 million). That’s the biggest participation by small investors in a London listing in years, and the flop could deter them from taking part in future deals.
- Hoberman is still optimistic about the outlook for tech company IPOs in London.
- “This means that some of the frothier IPOs may get pulled but it won’t affect high quality companies,” he said. “And there’s still another tech company on the [London Stock Exchange] worth over £5 billion ($6.9 billion),” he added.
- That’s Deliveroo, despite its dismal debut.
