- Dog and Boy, a new short firm from Netflix that uses AI to help generate its lavish background images and music, has set off a storm about the impact of technology, specifically generative AI, on jobs.
- In a media statement promoting the film, Netflix expressed its hopes that its use of AI would help future animation productions thanks to a current 'shortage of human resources in the animation industry.'
- As gaming news site Kotaku pointed out, 'artists did not take this bullshit at face value,' slamming Netflix for devaluing the work of animators and freelancers generally, and trying to avoid paying them in this instance.
- Other people took issue with how Netflix only credited those who worked on the short as 'AI (+Human).' The credits go on to list Rinna Inc, an AI artwork company, and a handful of AI researchers, before listing a handful of AI researchers.'
- The animation industry in Japan is notoriously underpaid.

- Netflix created an anime that uses AI-generated artwork to paint its backgrounds—and people on social media are pissed.
- In a tweet, Netflix Japan claimed that the project, a short called he Dog & The Boy uses AI generated art in response to labor shortages in the anime industry.
- “As an experimental effort to help the anime industry, which has a labor shortage, we used image generation technology for the background images of all three-minute video cuts!” the streaming platform wrote in a tweet.
- The tweet drew instant criticism and outrage from commenters who felt that Netflix was using AI to avoid paying human artists. This has been a central tension since image-generation AI took off last year, as many artists see the tools as unethical—due to being trained on masses of human-made art scraped from the internet—and cudgels to further cut costs and devalue workers. Netflix Japan’s claim that the AI was used to fill a supposed labor gap hit the bullseye on these widespread concerns.
- According to a press release, the short film was created by Netflix Anime Creators Base—a Tokyo-based hub the company created to bolster its anime output with new tools and methods—in collaboration with Rinna Inc., an AI-generated artwork company, and production company WIT Studio, which produced the first three seasons of Attack on Titan.
- Painterly and dramatic backdrops of cityscapes and mountain ranges are emphasized in the trailer for The Dog & The Boy. In a sequence at the end of the promo video on Twitter, an example of a background—a snowy road—shows a hand-drawn layout, where the background designer is listed as “AI + Human,” implying that a supervised image generation algorithm generated the scene. In the next two scenes, an AI generated version appears, crediting Rinna and multiple AI developers, some affiliated with Osaka University.
- Demand for new anime productions has skyrocketed in recent years, but the industry has long been fraught with labor abuses and poor wages. In 2017, an illustrator died while working, allegedly of a stress-induced heart attack and stroke; in 2021, the reported salary of low-rung anime illustrators was as little as $200 a month, forcing some to reconsider the career as a sustainable way to earn a living while having a life outside work, buying a home, or supporting children. Even top animators reportedly earn just $1,400 to $3,800 a month—as the anime industry itself boomed during the pandemic amid a renewed interest in at-home streaming. In 2021, the industry hit an all-time revenue high of $18.4 billion.
- As the use of AI art becomes more commonplace, artists are revolting against their craft being co-opted by algorithms and their work being stolen to use in datasets that create AI-generated art. In January, a group of artists filed a class action lawsuit against Stability AI, DeviantArt, and Midjourney, claiming that text-to-image tools violate their ownership rights.
- Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

- The anime community has been rife with controversy over AI-generated images. Today, Netflix joined the hot new trend of being ratioed online for terrible AI takes. The streaming platform not only produced a commercial project with AI, it tried to justify doing so by citing the “labor shortage” in the anime industry. Artists did not take this bullshit at face value, and they weren’t quiet about it either.
- Dog and Boy is an animated movie created by Netflix Japan and Wit Studio (which produced Ranking of Kings and co-animated Spy x Family). According to a Vice translation, Netflix Japan tweeted: “As an experimental effort to help the anime industry, which has a labor shortage, we used image generation technology for the background images of all three-minute video cuts!”
- The production credits list AI as the co-creators of the background art and the music. Before you click “play,” I’d like to make one thing clear: It doesn’t matter if the resulting video is good or bad. One of the wealthiest anime producers in the world chose not to employ at least two living artists to create the movie, and that’s not great for the future of animation. Or artists as both workers and a community.
- Even worse, the artist who had to handhold the AI doesn’t appear to be credited at all. The background designer is credited as “AI (+ Human).” Um, I’m pretty sure that the human has an actual name. So not only was Netflix Japan experimenting with some ethically dodgy technology, they’re showing exactly how little they respect living background painters. If Japan has an animator shortage, it’s because the industry pays freelancers a poverty wage to hand-draw images.
- In Japan, artist pay has not risen with the cost of living, which makes it impossible for some to survive in the industry. Even under these conditions, companies continuously find ways to underpay their employees. Despite being massively successful, the studio behind the movie Promare and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners was forced to settle with its own staff over unpaid overtime. If artists don’t want to work, it’s likely because they can’t afford to.
- Netflix could have easily solved this problem with higher pay. Instead, it’s trying to cut out some artists altogether. Kotaku reached out to ask Netflix about the specific challenges they have with recruiting human artists, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.
- On Twitter, artists and creators are, as the kids like to say, “beating Netflix’s ass in the quote retweets.” A Netflix showrunner wrote: “Not something to be proud of, babes.” Even an AI engineer offered to introduce Netflix to animators looking for work while chiding the company for not “looking very hard.” The quote retweets are filled with people demanding higher pay for animators, which warms even my cold, cynical heart.
- “You want everything for free, but we need money to live,” tweeted one Japanese comic artist. “And a lot of work that can worsen our health”

- Over the past year, generative AI has kicked off a wave of existential dread over potential machine-fueled job loss not seen since the advent of the industrial revolution. On Tuesday, Netflix reinvigorated that fear when it debuted a short film called Dog and Boy that utilizes AI image synthesis to help generate its background artwork.
- Directed by Ryotaro Makihara, the three-minute animated short follows the story of a boy and his robotic dog through cheerful times, although the story soon takes a dramatic turn toward the post-apocalyptic. Along the way, it includes lush backgrounds apparently created as a collaboration between man and machine, credited to "AI (+Human)" in the end credit sequence.
- In the announcement tweet, Netflix cited an industry labor shortage as the reason for using the image synthesis technology:
- As an experimental effort to help the anime industry, which has a labor shortage, we used image generation technology for the background images of all three-minute video cuts!
- Netflix and the production company WIT Studio tapped Japanese AI firm Rinna for assistance with generating the images. They did not announce exactly what type of technology Rinna used to generate the artwork, but the process looks similar to a Stable Diffusion-powered "img2img" process than can take an image and transform it based on a written prompt.
- The film is currently available to view for free on YouTube.
- Almost immediately, Twitter users responded with a torrent of negative replies to Netflix's tweet announcing the film, such as, "I know a ton of animators looking for work if you guys are struggling to find them (are you looking very hard?)." Several others quoted legendary Studio Ghibli animator Hayao Miyazaki as saying that AI-powered art "is an insult to life itself."
- "Image generation technology"? Just say you stole artists work through an AI gen and then claimed a labour shortage even though people like me and my brother who have degrees can't get jobs because there's 500 other graduates also trying to get an interview per application. Liars
- In a news release, Netflix expressed its hopes that the new technology would assist with future animation productions (translated by Google Translate): "As a studio, Netflix focuses on supporting creators in the creation of works on a daily basis. As the shortage of human resources in the animation industry is seen as an issue, we hope that this initiative will contribute to the realization of a flexible animation production process through appropriate support for creators using the latest technology."
- It also looks like Makihara also wanted to push boundaries in animation by using AI technology as part of the production process. The Netflix release quoted him as saying, "By combining tools and hand-drawn techniques, we can create something unique to humans ... I think that the core of the story is 'drawing a human being.' I think that it will be possible to secure and return to its roots, which will eventually strengthen the strengths of Japanese animation and expand its possibilities."
- Labor shortage or not, AI assistance may possibly speed up production times and lower production costs, allowing the creation of more animated content than ever before. But will people be happy about it? That remains to be seen.

- In 2016, Studio Ghibli co-founder and director Hayao Miyazaki, responsible for beloved anime classics like Princess Mononoke and Kiki’s Delivery Service, made headlines around the world for his reaction to an AI animation program. “I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all,” Miyazaki told the software engineers who came to show their creation to him. “I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.” A half-decade later, artificial intelligence and the potential role it could play in anime productions is once again in the spotlight.
- This week, Netflix shared Dog and Boy, an animated short the streaming giant described as an “experimental effort” to address the anime industry’s ongoing labor shortage. “We used image generation technology for the background images of all three-minute video cuts,” said Netflix Japan of the project on Twitter, according to a machine translation. The short is touching but was immediately controversial. As Motherboard points out, many Twitter users accused Netflix of using AI to avoid paying human artists.

- Others took issue with how Netflix and Wit Studio, the company that produced the short, credited those who worked on Dog and Boy. As you can see at the end of the video, human animators were not only involved in the creation of the short’s backgrounds, but they also revised the AI’s work. However, the background designer is listed as “AI (+Human).” The credits go on to list Rinna Inc, an AI artwork company, and a handful of AI researchers.
- Many artists worry about the potential for AI to devalue their work, but that concern is particularly acute among anime creators. The labor shortages Netflix points to are the result of unsustainable labor practices that see the majority of Japan’s animation studios depend on essentially unpaid freelancers to complete much of the work that makes anime possible.
- According to data from the Japanese Animation Creators Association published in 2018, in-between animators, the workers who draw the frames that make a scene look fluid, earn about ¥200 (or less than $2) per drawing. With many frames taking more than an hour to produce, the average in-between animator can expect to make about ¥1.1 million (or $10,000) per year. For context, in 2019, Japan’s poverty line was at ¥2.2 million.

- Netflix and Wit Studio, the animation production company behind Spy x Family and Attack on Titan, have released a new short film. Titled “The Dog & The Boy,” the short follows a boy who discovers a robotic dog before they’re separated by a great tragedy. It’s emotional and cute, but the most noteworthy thing about this short isn’t the storyline — it’s the fact that the backgrounds were generated by artificial intelligence.
- The Netflix Japan tweet about the short explains that this method is “an experimental effort to help the anime industry, which has a labor shortage.” A blog post on the Netflix Japan site goes into more detail about the process.

- Using AI to create art has become a very controversial topic in the past few months. With tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Free AI Art Generator rising in popularity over the past year, many artists have spoken out about how these programs utilize their art without consent and how their specific art styles can be replicated with just a string of words typed into one of these programs. The #SupportHumanArtists movement started to call attention to the ethical issues that come with AI usage.
- On Twitter, many users have called out Netflix and WIT Studio for this short film and for the possibility of using AI tools to replace background artists. The animation industry in Japan, in particular, already faces a lot of issues, chief among them the fact that many animators are underpaid.
- Netflix Japan has moved to AI quoting a "Labor Shortage", when they just laid off hundreds of animators and cut hundreds of animation projects. #SupportHumanArtists is so important right now https://t.co/jMjfbd53kw

- Netflix is getting thoroughly blasted on social media for using artificial intelligence to make an anime rather than paying actual human artists. Which, fair.
- Released by Netflix this week, The Dog & The Boy(opens in a new tab) is a three-minute sci-fi anime short about a kid whose robot dog waits for him when he goes off to war. It isn't a unique story(opens in a new tab), but what sets this anime apart is that its background art was generated using AI rather than drawn by humans.
- According to images shown during The Dog & The Boy's credits, a human would draw a relatively rough layout of what they wanted by hand. This image was then put through an AI art generator a few times, before finally being revised by hand to create the final artwork that was used in the anime.
- Exactly who it was that did this work is unclear, as The Dog & The Boy doesn't credit them by name. Instead, it simply lists its background designer as "AI (+Human)." It does, however, list Rinna Co., Lt. as its AI development company.
- In a tweet from Netflix Japan(opens in a new tab), the company reportedly characterised its use of AI art generation in The Dog & The Boy's production as an experiment(opens in a new tab) intended to ease an alleged labour shortage in the anime industry. This has caused a swift and angry response from Twitter users, who contend that there isn't a labour shortage — just a shortage of companies willing to provide decent working conditions(opens in a new tab) and a living wage(opens in a new tab). The median average income for top anime talent in 2019 was reportedly just $36,000, while those lower down can earn as little as $200 per month.
- Netflix Japan's post now has thousands of quote retweets and replies, with the general consensus being that its use of AI art generation to replace human artists is, to use polite language, awful. AI art generation has been a contentious issue in recent months, with artists concerned about issues of copyright, theft, and job losses. Unfortunately, Netflix's latest move seems to have proven these fears well-founded.
- The potential repercussions of Netflix's AI experiment feel even more ominous considering its American studio Netflix Animation laid off 30 employees(opens in a new tab) last September in a bid to streamline production.
- Mashable has reached out to Netflix for comment.
- The Dog & The Boy was produced by the Netflix Anime Creators' Base(opens in a new tab), while anime studios Production I.G and Wit Studio provided support. Described as a "community space" at the time of its 2021 launch, the Netflix Anime Creators' Base was initially intended to strengthen Netflix's anime offerings by developing concept art to support studios in pre-production.
- "From this space, we want to promote best practices and high production standards, to empower creators with the necessary tools and resources of anime production over time," Netflix said at the time.
- Last year it was reported that Netflix's Japanese division failed to declare ¥1.2 billion ($9.3 million) in profit over three years(opens in a new tab). As a result, Netflix was hit with around ¥300 million ($2.3 million) in additional taxes, including on the amount that the company hadn't initially disclosed.
- Labour shortage or not, it certainly sounds as though Netflix has more than enough resources to hire a couple of background artists, pay them a decent wage, and actually list them by name in the credits.
