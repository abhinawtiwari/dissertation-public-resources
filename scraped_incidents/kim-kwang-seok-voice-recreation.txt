- SEOUL - Even though South Korean folk rock singer Kim Kwang-seok has been dead for nearly 25 years, his fans will be able to hear him perform a new song cover on Friday (Jan 29)  thanks to artificial intelligence (AI) technology used to recreate his voice.
- The voice AI system - Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) - learned 20 songs of Kim based on training tool with over 700 Korean songs to improve accuracy, so that the system can mimic a new song in Kim’s own style, according to the AI company Supertone which recreated the dead singer’s voice.
- In part of a television show to be aired on Friday by South Korean broadcaster SBS, “Competition of the Century: AI vs Human”, the late singer’s voice is used to perform ‘I miss you’, a ballad released in 2002 by the country’s famous singer Kim Bum-soo.
- “What we were most cared and worried about was asking Kim’s family for their permission,” said Kim Min-ji, a producer of the show.
- “But when we played the AI audio to his family, they were very happy with it. They were wary at first, but after listening to the outcome, they said it was like Kim Kwang-seok came back alive,” she added.
- To sound accurate, it was important that the voice and performance carried enough feeling, Nam Sang-moon, chief producer for the show, said.
- [[nid:508757]]
- “It’s about singing a song with emotions. And each note should be connected naturally, hence emotions can be delivered, which is the key point of the technology. The developers trained the AI to exactly imitate human’s vocal organs,” Nam said.
- Fears around AI in terms of copyright and possible ethics breaches should be addressed but should not overshadow the entire field, producers said.
- “We should not only see the AI in a copyright category, but also think about ways to use AI technology as a tool that can help humans and makes us happy,” said Nam.
- A Seoul resident, however, disagreed.
- “My biggest concern is that AI is acting like a human being. There are original skillsets and habits that only human beings can possess. If AI can imitate all that, the earth will be dominated by AI, not human beings in the future. I’m worried,” said 29-year-old Im Uk-jin said.

- The 1996 demise of popular South Korean folk singer Kim Kwang-seok has been shrouded in mystery, leaving fans to devise their own theories, while hoping to hear his voice one last time. Thanks to new developments in the field of AI, fans will now get to hear his voice on national television for the first time in 25 years, singing new material.
- Korean National broadcaster SBS plans to use artificial intelligence to revive Kwang-seok’s voice on a new programme, "Competition of the Century: AI vs Human," to air later this week. The announcement has sparked a wave of excitement among the singer’s fans, who still participate in an annual gathering in a street near his childhood home in the city of Daegu.
- A one-minute promotional clip of Kim singing "I Miss You," a ballad released by Kim Bum-soo, another famous Korean singer, in 2002, has fetched over 150,000 views on YouTube since December 2020. Another video that shows behind-the-scenes footage from the production of the episode has garnered over 750,000 views in just three weeks since its release.
- “The recovered voice sounds very much like him, as if Kim recorded it alive,” Kim Jou-yeon, a Kim fan for 30 years, told CNN.
- This is not the first time a South Korean celebrity has been brought to life through AI. In December, music channel Mnet aired One More Time, a show that used AI and holograms of other late artists to pay tribute to their work. On New Year’s Eve, famous boyband BTS also performed with an AI-generated likeness of singer Shin Hae-chul, who died after surgery in 2014.
- While these programmes continue to strike a chord with fans of late singers and tech enthusiasts alike, they have also given rise to ethical concerns attached to resurrecting the voices of the dead. The creation of new material in dead people’s voices through AI also raises copyright issues, since it’s not clear if the owner is the creator of the AI or the AI system itself.
- SBS Producer Nam Sang-moon has said that the idea for a human vs AI competition struck him when he watched world champion Lee See-dol play South Korean AI programme HanDol at the ancient strategy game of Go in 2019. In an impressive and unexpected feat, Lee managed to win one of their three matches, when only a month ago, he had declared his retirement from the game, citing AI as an undefeatable competitor.
- This game had reminded producer Sang-moon of See-dol's earlier match against AlphaGo, an AI programme developed by Google DeepMind, in 2016. That time, AlphaGo won four out of five games, making Lee admit he had "misjudged" the machine's capabilities.
- He then began pulling together the six episode competitive series, featuring AI performances from the late Kim Kwang-seok, with help from Supertone, a South Korean startup founded in 2020 that provides AI audio solutions for content creators.
- “For example, BTS is really busy these days, and it'd be unfortunate if they can't participate in content due to lack of time. So, if BTS uses our technology when making games or audiobooks or dubbing an animation, for instance, they wouldn't necessarily have to record in person,” co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Choi Hee-doo said.
- Supertone's Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) technology learns voices by listening to multiple songs with corresponding lyrics and notes. Before learning Kim Kwang-seok’s voice in ten of his songs including hits like “A Letter From a Private,” “Song of My Life” and “In the Wilderness,” the system had to learn 100 songs by 20 other singers. This ensured that the AI system now knows Kim’s unique voice well enough to imitate his style and pronunciation.
- In the upcoming SBS show, the AI Kwang-seok will be singing a duet alongside a human singer. Ock Joo-hyun, the former lead singer of girl band Fin.K.L, will be taking on the AI machine, which has also been tasked with learning her voice.
- Even outside of South Korea, there have been several attempts to resurrect deceased singers—from Elvis to Tupac through holograms, which have been both well-received and controversial. Hologram concerts have also been around for a while, but have struggled to create the same connect between fans and the artist that live performances are known for, in the absence of essential concert elements like audience interaction.
- The reason singers are picked to be replicated over other public figures known for their speeches and ideology, such as Winston Churchill or Martin Luther King Jr., is because AI can only imitate mannerisms and voice. What it cannot do is predict what a person would say in a given situation, regardless of the amount of data it has.
- Recently, however, singer Kanye West tried to achieve this feat when he gifted wife Kim Kardashian a hologram of her late father Robert Kardashian, which (who?) quickly became meme material for crowning West as “the most, most, most, most, most genius man in the whole world”.
- While reviving people’s voices might simply be intended as a way to entertain and enthral audiences, such attempts are fraught with technological concerns that must be addressed with stricter guidelines and regulations. In the past, fake voices have been used for misinformation campaigns and fraud. In 2019, a U.K. based executive was scammed out of $243,000 by using AI voice technology that made him believe he was on the phone with his boss. Internet security experts at Symantec have reported at least two more cases of using audio deepfakes to scam people of big bucks since then.
- These are not the only issues that complicate the matter though. Resurrecting singers’ voices using AI also raises the question of ownership. Can this style of AI-generated music be copyrighted? And if yes, then by who? Who holds the ownership of the voice being replicated?
- In the Kim Kwang-seok case, producer Sang-moon claims SBS had sought and received the consent of Kim's family to reproduce his voice before proceeding with the show. Just like with the other cast members, Kwang-seok’s family were paid a one-time fee for featuring his voice on the show.
- While this is major news for Kwang-seok’s fans, they must be alert enough to catch the show while it airs, because neither Supertone nor SBS currently have any plans to release his new material as a single.

- A South Korean national broadcaster on January 25 announced that it will recreate the vocals of a popular deceased South Korean superstar Kim Kwang-Seok using artificial intelligence (AI) in a television programme Competition of the Century: AI vs Human. The show is scheduled to air later this week. SBS will bring back the late folk singer on stage artificially for his fans, following the footsteps of music channel Mnet that aired the show One More Time, using AI-generated voices. The broadcasters plan to clone Kwang-Seok's voice from the real songs with synthetic vocals, produced from a set of computerised algorithms. According to sources of CNN, this wouldn’t be the first time that the country’s music streaming services and the national broadcasters have turned to the analytics of machine learning to bring LIVE performances from the demised rockstars on a musical event.
- After nearly 25 years since his death, the influential frontman of the folk band Dongmulwon will be revived with expressive voice-overs that will be digitally translated to melodious songs in his AI voice clone. Earlier, the famous K-Pop superstars BTS performed online using the AI version of a late pioneering singer from experimental rock music, Shin Hae-Chul. The rock legend’s agency also teamed up with a local film company to produce a biopic in remembrance of the singer’s tumultuous life.
- The musical fanatics, however, raised ethical issues against South Korea’s Big Hit Entertainment's artists including BTS and TXT about resurrecting the demised singers’ voices. Many in the South Korean music industry objected to cloning vocal performances using artificial intelligence and hologram technology, which has also raised copyright issues. Although, the AI performances have also cherished some long-standing fans willing to hear their favourite dead artists perform LIVE in decades.

- Aged 31, the South Korean folk band artist passed away in 1996 under mysterious circumstances. His death shocked the world as fans suspected homicide, even as a probe identified the cause of his death as a suicide. The late singer was back in the headlines in 2017 after the death of his daughter, which was allegedly concealed by Kwang-Seok's widow for at least a decade. According to the Korean Herald, the South Korean police opened a probe into the girl’s death from 10 years ago on a formal complaint of Kim’s elder brother Kim Kwang-bok and a local reporter, Lee Sang-ho.

- For the first time in 25 years, the distinctive vocals of South Korean superstar Kim Kwang-seok will be heard on national television singing new material.
- It’s a feat made all the more extraordinary because the famous folk singer is dead.
- National broadcaster SBS plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) to bring Kim’s voice back to life on a new program, “Competition of the Century: AI vs Human,” to air later this week.
- It’s not the first time AI has been used to revive a famous singer in South Korea.
- In December, music channel Mnet aired “One More Time,” a show that used AI and holograms of late artists to pay tribute to their work.
- And, on New Year’s Eve, K-Pop superstars BTS performed online with an AI version of singer Shin Hae-chul, who died after surgery in 2014.
- Recent AI performances have excited fans of their music and the technology, but others have raised concerns about the ethics and legalities of resurrecting the voices of the dead. The creation of new works – or revived voices – by AI also raises copyright issues. Who is considered the owner? The creator of the AI program or the AI system itself?
- Kim was aged just 31 when he died in 1996 at the peak of his career after a string of hits including “A Letter From a Private,” “Song of My Life” and “In the Wilderness.”
- His death was considered to be so shocking that some have never accepted the official cause of suicide, instead choosing to believe conspiracy theories that he was murdered.
- Decades later, fans still gather in a street named in his honor near his childhood home in the city of Daegu, though this year’s tributes were mostly held online due to the coronavirus pandemic.
- Murals of the artist gaze over the street, where tourists sit on benches shaped like guitars and listen to musicians playing his greatest hits.
- So, when national broadcaster SBS announced that it was using AI to recreate the Kim’s voice on a new program set to air this month, it sent fans into a frenzy.
- A one-minute promotional clip of Kim singing “I Miss You,” a ballad released by Kim Bum-soo in 2002, has been viewed more than 145,000 times on YouTube since December.  And a video showing the process behind the episode has been viewed more than 750,000 times since it was posted on January 6.
- “The recovered voice sounds very much alike him, as if Kim recorded it alive,” said Kim Jou-yeon, a Kim fan for 30 years.
- It even impressed a young fan Park Hye-hyun, who was just two years old when Kim died. “One of my wishes was to hear more songs in Kim’s voice … I had tears,” she said.
- SBS Producer Nam Sang-moon said the idea for an AI versus human competition came to him after he watched world champion Lee Se-dol take on South Korean AI program HanDol in the ancient strategy game of Go in 2019.
- Surprisingly, Lee won one of their three matches.
- Just a month earlier, Lee had announced his retirement from professional Go competition, saying AI was “an entity that cannot be defeated.”
- Go requires two players to place black and white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. Each competitor tries to claim the most territory by surrounding their opponent’s pieces so they’re removed from the board.
- Lee’s game against HanDol reminded Nam of Lee’s earlier match against AlphaGo, an AI program developed by Google DeepMind, in 2016. That time, AlphaGo won four out of five games, and afterward Lee said he had “misjudged” the machine’s capabilities.
- “Lee-AlphaGo was a big shock followed by short but huge interest in AI, which is still being developed somewhere, but we’re unfamiliar with it yet,” SBS producer Nam said in a phone interview.
- Nam sensed the Korean public was ready for an update and began pulling together the six-part AI competition series, including the AI performance from the late Kim Kwang-seok.
- The audio AI company behind Kim’s reincarnated voice is Supertone, a South Korean startup founded in 2020 that provides AI audio solutions for content creators, according to co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Choi Hee-doo.
- This is how deepfakes differ from video manipulation we've seen before
- “For example, BTS is really busy these days, and it’d be unfortunate if they can’t participate in content due to lack of time. So, if BTS uses our technology when making games or audiobooks or dubbing an animation, for instance, they wouldn’t necessarily have to record in person,” Choi said.
- Supertone’s Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) technology learns voices by listening to multiple songs with corresponding notes and lyrics, Choi explained.
- The system learned 100 songs by 20 singers before it was given 10 Kim Kwang-seok songs to learn. It now knows his voice well enough to mimic the singer’s unique style and pronunciation, Choi said.
- In the SBS show, the AI Kim won’t be competing against a human singer – he’ll be singing a duet with one. “We revived Kim Kwang-seok to show the capability of it,” said Nam, the show’s producer.
- Instead, Ock Joo-hyun, the former leader singer of girl band Fin.K.L, will be taking on the AI machine. Just as the AI system learned Kim’s voice, it will be trained to mimic her, too.
- While some may consider a competition between an AI singer and a human as harmless fun, others warn the technology poses threats that need to be addressed by stricter guidelines and regulations.
- Tech-savvy South Korea is considered to be at the forefront of AI technology, but there are calls for more regulation.
- Within days of the launch of a petition last week, more than 376,000 people had put their signature to calls for tougher punishments for the creators of deepfake videos, particularly those that use the faces of female celebrities for pornography.
- Amsterdam-based researchers Deeptrace counted more than 14,000 deepfake videos online in 2019, and found that almost all of them – 96% – were non-consensual deepfake pornography using the images of female celebrities, many from South Korea.
- Replicating someone’s voice also poses serious risks, especially if fake audio is used in misinformation campaigns and fraud.  In 2019, scammers convinced an executive to transfer hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash to an account, by faking the voice of his boss using audio software.
- “Every year, we see about $470 million in fraud losses, including from wire transfer and phone scams. It’s a massive scale,” Vijay Balasubramaniyan, the CEO and co-founder of Pindrop, told CNN last year.
- Dem Party deepfaked own chairman to highlight concerns
- Worldwide, nations and organizations are calling for legal reform, ethical guidelines and social agreements to prevent the misuse of AI.
- UNESCO is working with its 193 member states to lay the ethical foundations for regulating the technology. Last September, it released a draft of its “Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence.” The final report is expected to be presented to the UNESCO’s General Conference later this year.
- In December, South Korea’s Ministry of Science and Information, Communication Technology released the “National AI Ethical Guideline,”  a document that lays out basic standards for people involved in the development and application of AI. It says AI should be “developed and used in accord with its purpose and intention as a tool for human life, and that process should also be ethical.”
- The same month, the ministry released what it calls a roadmap for AI legislation, which proposes to expand South Korea’s intellectual property rights beyond works created by humans to the investors and inventors behind AI creations.
- Supertone’s Chief Technology Officer Heo Hoon said he supports laws to regulate the industry. He said to mitigate the current risks the company doesn’t deal directly with the public, preferring to work with businesses that share its ethics.
- What is a deepfake, explained
- “We are clearly aware of the possibility of our technology being misused when in hands of the public,” Heo said. “I think reviving the voice of the deceased would bring backlash, which hopefully would begin a social debate and conclusively lead to legislation.”
- The company has built a level of protection into its recordings by marking the audio as being produced by its AI, though casual listeners are unlikely to know.
- “We have watermarking technology, which is an information planted in audio, that can’t be heard, but tracks where it was made and how it’s being distributed,” Heo said.
- The use of AI to create works traditionally produced by human creativity raises the issue of ownership. If AI creates the works, does the program hold the copyright, or does it belong to the programmer?
- Lawyer Ko Hwan-kyoung, an expert in AI and data protection, said the issue needs to be addressed as AI becomes more advanced.
- “What’s interesting about AI is that it’s evolving to a level where it can write and compose by studying datas,” Ko said.
- Last year, singer Hayeon released “Eyes on You,” a single composed by an AI program.  Human producers later refined the song, according to her record label, Enterarts.
- Elsewhere, AI has been used to create news stories, books and even art. Typically, the creator is considered to own the work, but in the case of AI it’s less clear.
- “Are we going to acknowledge AI as legal entity with legal personality like humans, and grant copyright?” Ko, the lawyer, asked. “We need necessary regulation that guarantees human safety, not an excessive one that hinders development of AI technology.”
- In the case of  Kim Kwang-seok, producer Nam said SBS gained the consent of Kim’s family to reproduce his voice before proceeding with the show.
- SBS paid a one-off fee to his family for featuring his voice in the show, as they did with other cast members, Nam said. Parts of the show will be published on YouTube after it airs, but neither SBS nor Supertone plan to release Kim’s song as a single.
- “We’ve agreed not to officially release the songs introduced in the show,” Supertone’s Choi said.
- So for now, Kim fans will have to be content with playing the old songs recorded by the real singer at a microphone more than 20 years ago.

- Share:
- JAKARTA - The use of Artificial Intelligence or AI in South Korean music industry has attracted people's attention. The application of this technology to deceased musicians has caused controversy.
- The SBS television channel created a new program entitled Competition of the Century: AI vs Human. This event brings singers from AI against humans.
- In the first episode, singer Kim Kwang Seok appeared in AI format for the first time in 25 years. The late Kim Kwang Seok who died in 1996 sang Kim Bum Soo's I Miss You complete with his original voice.
- Previously in December 2020, the Mnet television channel made a special One More Time program using AI. They presented several famous South Korean singers who had died, such as Turtle Man who sang the song Start Over from Gaho, which is the soundtrack of the Korean drama Itaewon Class. In this event, singer Kim Hyun Sik was also present to commemorate his 30 years of departure.
- It didn't stop there. At the New Year's Eve 2020 concert, the K-pop group BTS also performed with the AI version of the late singer Shin Hae Chul. Then, at the 2020 Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA), they also performed with the AI version of Suga, who is still recovering from his injury.
- Why Use AI?
- The presence of AI in South Korea is not new. Some time ago, the agency SM Entertainment had made a School of Oz musical concert using this technology. However, in recent times many singers who have died have appeared again in the AI version. This is the problem.
- Cited from CNN International, Nam Sang Moon as SBS producer thought of this idea after he watched Go's match between Lee Se-dol and an AI program called HanDol in 2019.
- At that time, Lee won one of three matches against HanDol but then he chose to retire from this competition because he thought AI was a form that could not be defeated.
- Meanwhile, for musicians' performances, they try to keep up with technological developments and shorten the time. This was stated by Choi Hee Doo, the co-founder of Supertone who handled BTS performances with Shin Hae Chul.
- Supertone is a South Korean company that was founded in 2020. This company focuses on using AI as content creators.
- “For example, BTS is busy at the moment and it would be difficult if they couldn't participate due to timing issues. So if BTS uses our technology when making games or audio books or filling in animated voices, for example, they don't have to come record in person, ”said Choi Hee Doo.
- The way Supertone works in utilizing AI is, the system will try 100 songs from 20 singers before being given Kim Kwang Seok's songs to learn. In addition, there is Ock Joo Hyun - the leader of the Fin.KL girl group - who will be the AI machine test experiment.
- Full of Cons in the Community
- Singer Kim Kwang Seok passed away at the age of 31 in 1996. He was at the peak of popularity through songs such as A Letter From a Private and Song of My Life.
- In the midst of this popularity, Kim Kwang Seok's body was found lifeless at his home. The police said Kim Kwang Seok was depressed and chose to end his life. This statement is made based on the testimony of the wife.
- But until a decade later, fans suspected Kim Kwang Seok's death was caused by the idol's murder. Until now, fans still gather on a street near his childhood home in Daegu City.
- When SBS announced they were using AI to get Kim Kwang Seok to appear on television, fans were divided into two camps. First, those who were impressed by the teaser video were happy to be able to watch Kim Kwang Seok again on television.
- Meanwhile, other parties consider technology to pose a threat that needs to be managed under regulation. They also questioned the legality of using Kim Kwang Seok's voice. Is it copyright protected?
- SBS party replied that they got permission from Kim Kwang Seok's family to reproduce the singer's voice. SBS paid the fee and part of his performance was released to the public via YouTube.
- However, SBS and Supertone agreed not to release any songs from the show in digital format.
- Potential hazard
- The AI ability that can mimic someone's movements and voices deserves thumbs up. But this regulation regarding the use of AI could create a new clone of identity.
- 376,000 people signed a petition calling for the government to take tough action against deepfake video makers who used to use female celebrities for pornographic content or trick someone into sending money.
- Deeptrace, researchers from Amsterdam found 14 thousand deepfake videos spread in 2019, of which 96 percent came from South Korea with deepfake photos of female celebrities.
