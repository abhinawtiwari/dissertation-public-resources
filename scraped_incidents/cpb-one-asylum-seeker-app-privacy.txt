- The Biden administration is adopting controversial facial-recognition technology and other intrusive surveillance tools to process the backlog of thousands of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a new report.
- U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has distributed an app called “CBP One,” which uses facial-recognition technology to compare photos of migrants with various refugee databases, wrote the Los Angeles Times on Friday.
- Citing CBP legal disclosures and interviews with privacy analysts, the Times reported that in addition to tracking faces, the app uses geolocation and cloud technology to create databases of personal data that can be accessed by other law-enforcement agencies and stored for up to 75 years,
- According to the report, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) assessments describe the app as a necessary measure, since those who are seeking protection in the United States but have been “forced” back into Mexico under Trump policies and those whom the new administration has largely kept, cannot be “processed all at once.” Officials maintain the app offers a “safe and efficient” technical solution.
- The Times reminds us that under the Trump administration, some 70,000 asylum seekers were required to wait south of the border for immigration hearings in the United States. As the coronavirus emerged, the Trump administration closed the border to nonessential travel and summarily expelled migrants, including those seeking asylum. Border officials have since carried out roughly 800,000 expulsions. President Biden welcomed them “back,” but with a catch — asylum seekers may stay in America, but they need to register with the tracking app.
- 
- DHS officials call the technology a “smart border” innovation they believe is more effective than the previous administration’s crude walls and bans. In other words, putting electronic leashes on the newly arrived is “more humane” and somehow “smarter” than simply keeping them out.
- The DHS has been granted emergency approval to use the app to process users’ information in advance of arrival in the United States. This clearance from the Office of Management and Budget allowed it to bypass the usual public notification process required before it launches a new program.
- U.S. border officials have already enlisted international and nongovernmental organizations, such as the United Nations refugee agency, known as UNHCR, to use the app. The organizations identify asylum seekers in Mexico who were subjected to the Trump immigration policies and then submit their biographic and biometric information, including photographs, through the app to CBP.
- It is noted that submission of biometrics is voluntary, but at the same time, CBP primarily uses facial recognition to verify a person’s information and determine whether the asylum seekers will be allowed to enter the United States, which means that if the immigrant wants their case processed, they have no choice but to submit faceprints.
- Implementation of the app arrives just as the crisis at the border is peaking, with 110,000 single adults trying to cross in April alone — the highest number in a decade.
- Civil liberties and privacy experts, however, sounded alarms about the amount of data the app collects on already vulnerable immigrants.
- “CBP’s use of face recognition poses enormous risks to privacy and is another step down a dangerous path,” American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Senior National Security Attorney Ashley Gorski told the Times. “Whenever the government acquires a person’s faceprint, it creates a risk of persistent surveillance, where the government could identify and track people’s movements without their knowledge.”
- Despite the privacy concerns raised by the ACLU, a CBP spokesperson told the Times that the agency is “committed to protecting all sensitive information in its possession.”
- Chris McGrath of the United Nations refugee office expanded on the CBP agency’s efforts by saying: “The system is currently only used by UNHCR in exceptional cases — and only with the individual’s full informed consent – to retrieve a misplaced ‘A-number’ by using a photo to match with data already collected by the US government.”
- The mobile application CBP One was launched by DHS in February for travelers in order to ease the interaction with border authorities.
- “CBP has designed a one-stop portal of its mobile applications and services that will offer travelers a secure and convenient option to provide information related to their arrival to or departure from the United States,” said Diane J. Sabatino, deputy executive assistant commissioner of field operations, and added that CBP is working to determine how successfully to leverage “emerging technology” in times of international travel bouncing back.
- Last week, the Biden administration formally terminated a Trump-era Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), better known as “Remain in Mexico” program. MMP was a cornerstone of Trump’s border management policy; it required potential asylum seekers to stay in Mexico to wait out the result of their case in U.S. immigration court.
- Biden also asked Congress to pass legislation known as the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would provide a way for an estimated 11 million undocumented people to stay in the United States.

- Harris is due to travel to Guatemala and Mexico next week as part of her role in leading diplomatic efforts to reduce immigration from Central American countries as the administration tackles a steep increase in migrant crossings.

- President Biden asked Vice President Harris to lead efforts with Mexico and Northern Triangle countries to stem the flow of people across the southern border, in a move her critics say makes her 'border czar'
- A White House official said Harris aides appeared to 'panic,' according to CNN, saying they were worried that it could be politically harmful if she was directly linked to rising numbers of arrivals.
- Harris wanted a portfolio that would deliver victories, according to the report, especially on foreign policy.
- But other officials told DailyMail.com the issue had been mischaracterized and that Harris was running a broad range of diplomatic efforts - not the border itself.
- Symone Sanders, senior adviser to Harris, said: 'The vice president's work is not happening in a vacuum.
- 'We are all part of one team and much of the work the administration does is a whole of government approach. This applies to the work on migration and the border.
- 'Furthermore, specifically as it relates to the US Mexico relationship… it is broad.
- 'We talk about a wide range of issues with them: migration, economic, security and border are just a few.'

- Biden announced Harris' role in March, telling reporters she had been appointed 'because she's the most qualified person to do it, to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle, and the countries that can help, need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border.'
- Harris herself admitted the role was challenging.
- 'We have to give people some sense of hope that if they stay, that help is on the way,' she told CNN's Dana Bash.
- 'It's not going to be solved overnight; it's a complex issue. If this were easy, it would've been handled years ago.'
- Critics have focused on the border rather than her calls with foreign leaders, labeling her Biden's 'border czar.'
- 'Everything you're doing in Central America is always towards an eye on the border and what's happening in the United States,' Cris Ramon, an immigration consultant, told CNN.
- 'With the current dynamics in migration, what's happening at the US-Mexico border has implications in the Northern Triangle and vice versa.'

- The Biden administration recently rolled out a new app that uses facial recognition and geolocation technology to gather and store data about asylum seekers before they even enter the U.S., the Los Angeles Times reported Friday. While the Department of Homeland Security claims that the app will help alleviate some of the immense pressure at the border since the agency can't "process all individuals at once," critics have pointed out that it's alarming that the government is acquiring and saving the faceprints of "vulnerable migrants who have little choice but to consent" to using the app, as the Times writes.
- "It may not seem like a big deal to match a preexisting photograph to someone standing in front of you," Sophia Cope, a senior attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained. "But ultimately, the government is building a system of pervasive surveillance, and that creates a society that looks very different from a free republic."
- The app, called CBP One, is intended to "streamline the intake of information" about migrants, cutting down on the time-consuming process of Customs and Border Protection agents manually entering information on people who arrive at the border without any travel documents. The CBP insisted to the Times that the app does not technically "store" the information either; rather, it gets sent to databases, where it is ostensibly used to verify migrants' identities.
- While it's not new for the CBP to track everything from fingerprints to migrants' photographs, there have been problems with the agency's security before, like a 2018 pilot program that resulted in a facial recognition database getting hacked, compromising more than 180,000 images. ICE, of course, already uses facial recognition technology. Meanwhile, the "imposters" that the CBP app is designed to catch in the first place are, according to the Los Angeles Times, "a statistical grain of sand."
- "CBP asserts migrants can still come to ports of entry directly to seek asylum and don't have to use the app," the Los Angeles Times further notes. "But with the border still closed to non-essential travel, the process by which NGOs identify asylum seekers and request permission for them to enter — now, through CBP One — is, in reality, the only option available."

- 
- The Biden Administration has “quietly” expanded the use of the CBP One mobile app, which uses face biometrics to confirm the user’s identity, for people seeking asylum in the U.S., the Los Angeles Times reports.
- Administration officials have also expanded the use of CBP One to people who may be eligible for exemption from the Title 42 policy, put in place by the Trump Administration to remove people who have been in country with a communicable disease outbreak. CBP One provides the agency with biometric and biographic information typically gathered through time-consuming manual data entry during an interview with the subject, which CBP says is a safer process in pandemic conditions.
- CBP One and its online portal are described as an emerging technology in a recent privacy impact assessment. The app was initially launched with limited functionality last October.
- More than 11,000 people seeking asylum in the U.S. have been allowed into the country pending the decision in their cases, in a move partly enabled by CBP One, the report says.
- Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told a House Appropriations Subcommittee that DHS is seeking $1.2 billion to modernize its border security technologies, in part for “safe, orderly and humane treatment of migrants.”
- An ACLU representative says that any collection of face biometrics by the government “creates a risk of persistent surveillance,” and that the technology poses major privacy risks. The Times also spoke to a former CBP official who now works in consulting, who said the app could help alleviate the agency carry out more efficient and fairer processes at the border.
- CBP requested emergency approval to use CBP One in May from the Office of Management and Budget, which avoided the pubic comment period and notification process normally required. The UNHCR has begun using the app, according to the Times.
- A representative of non-profit refugee advocacy group HIAS said the app could reduce the influence of smugglers who pray on vulnerable migrants, if the government properly balances security with people’s opportunity to claim asylum.
- A CBP spokesperson told the Times that use of CBP One is voluntary.
- The privacy impact assessment notes that additional biographic information can be provided instead of a face biometric match, but that alternative is not yet ready.

- The Biden administration is embracing controversial facial recognition technology and other intrusive surveillance tools to process the backlog of thousands of migrants at the US-Mexico border, according to a report.

- In addition to tracking faces, the app uses geolocation and cloud technology to create databases of personal data that can be accessed by other law enforcement agencies and stored for up to 75 years, the paper said based on CBP legal disclosures and interviews with privacy analysts.
- The “smart border” technology is more effective at screening and admitting migrants than Trump-era policies like walls and travel bans, the Biden administration argues.
- But civil liberties and privacy experts sounded alarms about the amount of data the app collects.

- International organizations including the United Nations refugee office have reportedly agreed to use the CBP One app. These organizations reportedly use the app to identify migrants seeking asylum who were forced to remain in Mexico under Trump administration policies. The organizations submit migrants’ personal data — including photographs and biometric information — to CBP, which then uses facial recognition to verify the information, the Times reported.
- Despite the privacy concerns raised by the ACLU, a CBP spokesperson told the Times that the agency is “committed to protecting all sensitive information in its possession.”

- 
- The conversation about machine learning development largely centers on how individual organizations proceed - and whether they use adequate data, methods, algorithms, transparency, and a process that guarantees models do not go into production until they are tested and vetted.
- At the other end of the spectrum are AI models developed by Google and Facebook that are completely opaque, which is a different problem. But a third level between the two doesn't get the scrutiny it should - custom models developed by a third party, and given as an "enhancement" to existing licensees.
- Epic Systems Corporation, or Epic, is a privately held healthcare software company. According to the company, hospitals that use its software held medical records of 54% of patients in the United States and 2.5% of patients worldwide in 2015. In terms of market share, as per Wikipedia, Epic holds 31% of the US EHR  (Electronic Health Records) share for acute care hospitals, ahead of all others, including Cerner at 25% (as of May 2020). More than 250 million patients' have electronic records in Epic.
- Epic celebrated its 40th anniversary in March 2019. It had around 10,000 employees globally and generated about $2.9 billion in annual revenue. The company reports 40 percent of operating expenses are invested in research and development.
- Founder and CEO of Epic Judy Faulkner unveiled a new data research initiative and software during the Epic User Group annual meeting on Aug. 27 2020. She highlighted the Cosmos program, which is designed to mine data from millions of patient medical records to improve research into treatments. The program gathers de-identified patient data from 8 million patients at nine health systems, and 31 more organizations have signed on to participate. The company also announced new products focused on letting physicians write shorter notes and voice recognition software.
- What has happened with Cosmos since then is something of a mystery. We have been unable find any 2021 mentions of Cosmos, other than this: "Epic will also feature updates at the conference from its Epic Health Research Network, which publishes insights from its HIPAA-limited Cosmos data set from more than 113 million patients." The growth from 8million to 113 million is mentioned with not explanation.
- Epic embarked on a program of AI prediction models as early as 2014. One of the first was called the Epic Sepsis Model. However, its usefulness is debatable. The predictive value of the index it produces is most significant for those who are hardly sick, and those who are deathly ill. That means, "This person isn't sick, or this person is circling the drain." It begs the question, "How useful is this?" Surely any clinician can apply the valuable heuristics of triage for the next steps of those not ill, and that are not likely to survive. The vast majority of decisions would seem to occur for all of those in the middle. This is called the Epic Deterioration Index. Via Fast Company:
- Loosely speaking, triage is an act of determining how sick a patient is at any given moment to prioritize treatment and limited resources. But historically, these tools have been used only after a rigorous peer review of the raw data and statistical analyses used to develop them. Epic's Deterioration Index, on the other hand, remains proprietary despite its widespread deployment.  Without direct access to the equations underlying Epic's Deterioration Index, or further external inquiry.
- More problems were documented via a Michigan-based study: Epic's widely used sepsis prediction model falls short among Michigan Medicine patients. The tool is included as part of Epic's electronic health record platform. According to the company, it calculates and indicates "the probability of a likelihood of sepsis" to help clinicians identify hard-to-spot cases. While some providers have reported success with the tool, as noted, researchers affiliated with the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor found its output to be "substantially worse" than what was reported by the vendor when applied to a large retrospective sample of more than 27,000 adult Michigan Medicine patients. The researchers highlighted the wider issues surrounding such proprietary models. They wrote in JAMA Internal Medicine:
- Our study has important national implications... The increase and growth in deployment of proprietary models have led to an underbelly of confidential, non- peer-reviewed model performance documents that may not accurately reflect real-world model performance.
- When AI goes sideways in an e-commerce context, and the online retailer sends you two left-foot shoes, it isn't the end of the world. After all, technology is never perfect. But when the biggest EHR (Electronic Health Records) provider, Epic, provides Machine Learning algorithms to predict care in a clinical setting, errors are a lot less tolerable, especially when the algorithms are not disclosed, nor is the model's development data explained.
- I hate to come back to that old canard about ethics, but when a doctor using the tool admits that "Nobody has amassed the numbers to do a statistically valid" test, it's more than troubling. As STAT put it in AI used to predict COVID-19 patients' decline before proven to work:
- 'Nobody has amassed the numbers to do a statistically valid' test of the AI, said Mark Pierce, a physician and chief medical informatics officer at Parkview Health, a nine-hospital health system in Indiana and Ohio that is using Epic's tool. 'But in times like this that are unprecedented in U.S. health care, you do the best you can with the numbers you have and err on the side of patient care.'
- It's even more troubling when you take into account that Epic PAYS hospitals as much as $1million to use the tool: I have not been able to determine the business case for this (The Verge: Health record company pays hospitals that use its algorithms).
- A detailed study of the efficacy of Epic's Deterioration Index (EDI) for identifying at-risk COVID-19 patience concluded:
- We found that EDI identifies small subsets of high- and low-risk patients with COVID-19 with sound discrimination. However, its clinical use as an early warning system is limited by low sensitivity. Studies of Epic's Deterioration Index for COVID-19 have been primarily negative. These findings highlight the importance of independent evaluation of proprietary models before widespread operational use among patients with COVID-1.
- The concerns surrounding this practice are its opacity. It is a proprietary system. What data, and what data preparation methods were applied, what algorithms, etc. are not known. But for many, the glaring ethical problem is: why Epic pays clients to use it?
- At HIMSS21 Digital, John Halamka, the president of Mayo Clinic Platform on the four significant challenges to AI adoption in healthcare, said, "augmentation of human decision making is going to be greatly beneficial" - but some hurdles need to be overcome first.
- However, one key issue that must be solved first is ensuring equity and combating bias that can be "baked in" to AI "The AI algorithms are only as good as the underlying data. And yet, we don't publish statistics describing how these algorithms are developed. The solution, he said, is greater transparency - spelling out and sharing via technology the ethnicity, race, gender, education, income and other details that go into an algorithm.
- Halamka points to what he calls the four grand challenges to AI adoption in healthcare:
- Lots of opinions, but here is my take:
- The fact that Epic pays hospitals to adopt it also needs a detailed explanation. ("Verona, Wis.-based EHR giant Epic gives financial incentives to hospitals and health systems that use its artificial intelligence algorithms, which can provide false predictions," according to a July 26 STAT News investigation).
- As per The Verge, Epic provided the following explanation for these financial incentives:
- 'Epic's Honor Roll is a voluntary program which encourages the adoption of features that help save lives, increase data exchange, and improve satisfaction for patients, physicians, and health systems,' Epic said in a statement to Stat News.
- I must have missed the part where they justify paying hospitals to use their model. The byzantine healthcare system in the US doesn't always seem logical, what we know for sure is that incentives drive the system.
- Whatever the explanation, Epic's Deterioration Index is now widely used. Fast Company already raised a similar question: How did a largely untested AI creep into hundreds of hospitals?. As the authors wrote:
- Even now, there have been, to our knowledge, only two peer-reviewed published studies of the index. The deployment of a largely untested proprietary algorithm into clinical practice-with minimal understanding of the potential unintended consequences for patients or clinicians-raises a host of issues.
- It remains unclear, for instance, what biases may be encoded into the index. Medicine already has a fraught history with race and gender disparities and biases... Some clinical scores, including calculations commonly used to assess kidney and lung function, have traditionally been adjusted based on a patient's race-a practice many in the medical community now oppose. Without direct access to the equations underlying Epic's Deterioration Index, or further external inquiry, it is impossible to know whether the index incorporates such race-adjusted scores in its algorithm, potentially propagating biases.
- What I find distressing is that Epic would develop a model, precise or not, that reduces a human being's course of treatment for a potentially deadly disease with a simple index of 1-10. I understand that clinicians may find this a helpful tool, but I'm an advocate for the patients. They didn't ask for this disease; clinicians chose this profession. They shouldn't be looking for shortcuts or cookie-cutter treatment.
