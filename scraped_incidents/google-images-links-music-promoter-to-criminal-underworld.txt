- Google has been ordered to pay AUD 208,000 to Milorad ('Michael') Trkulja, a 62-year-old man who had accused the company of defaming him with web and image search results that associated him with the criminal underworld.
- In 2004, Trkulja had been shot in the back at a Sydney restaurant in an unsolved crime involving a balaclava-wearing assailant, after which he had asked Google and Yahoo! to remove content associating him with Australian mafia and criminals, including a well-known drug dealer.
- Google's refusal to engage with Trkulja had forced him to file a legal complaint against the technology company in 2012 alleging it was indexing 'grossly defamatory content'. Google had argued it was not a publisher and was simply pointing to material published by third-parties, and that its search results took into account Trkulja's defamation claims.
- In 2013, Google removed links to some websites and blocked a number of autocomplete predictions and search queries relating to Mr Trkulja. However, it declined to remove the images of Mr Trkulja being indexed by its systems.
- Trkulja subsequently petitioned the Court of Appeal of Victoria's Supreme Court claiming Google had failed to block access to the damaging images, and asking it to grant a permanent injunction that would remove his name from Google's servers and receive AUD 355,000 in damages.
- Trkulja's suit was finally dismissed on the basis that the publication of his images next to those of hardened criminals could reasonably mean that Trkulja himself was a hardened criminal.
- In 2018, Trkulja appealed the Court of Appeal's verdict to the High Court, which overturned the decision on the basis that the search engine results could be construed as defamatory, that Google should be treated as the publisher, and that Trkulja should be allowed to bring forward his case.

- Google will have to be quicker to remove defamatory content, at least in Australia, after it lost a $200,000 libel action there. The decision may strengthen Lord McAlpine's hand if the Tory peer, who obtained settlements of £185,000 and £125,000 from the BBC and ITV respectively, decides to target the search engine next.
- Google has, until now, been relying on court decisions which absolve it of liability for defamation on the basis that, because it provides search results automatically using algorithms, it is not responsible for online content produced using its search engine. In England the courts have agreed with this analysis so far and in the Tamiz case earlier this year Mr Justice Eady held that Google should not be regarded as a publisher.
- However, the tale of Australia's most successful libel litigant may give Google and other search engines pause for thought. Milorad Trkulja, a music promoter, took action against Google over material online, which linked him with criminal figures in Melbourne. Trkulja has never been involved in any criminal activity, but was unfortunate enough to have been shot in a restaurant in 2004.
- His lawyers wrote to Google in October 2009 asking for the offending material, which included a number of images, to be removed, but received a reply saying that in line with Google's policies on content removal he should contact the owners of the website concerned instead.
- Trkulja sued Google and the jury concluded that the search engine was the publisher of images of Trkjulja and related information which suggested he was involved in crime and that his rivals had hired a hitman to kill him. Google's defence of innocent dissemination succeeded only up until the point that it was put on notice of the defamatory content; the jury awarded Trkulja $200,000 damages. He had already won $225,000 damages against Yahoo, which hosted the site concerned, in March.
- After the case the search engine said: "Google's search results are a reflection of the content and information that is available on the web. The sites in Google's search results are controlled by those sites' webmasters, not by Google."
- So they are sticking to a defence of their service which failed in the Australian court. The case does not bind a UK court, but it may mark a shift in the way judges look at search engines and platform providers and that may have serious implication for companies like Google and their users.
- If the Australian decision is followed by courts elsewhere search engines and platform providers will have to be a lot quicker in dealing with requests to take down material when they are contacted by a potential claimant and they will have to be more responsive to requests to sever links to defamatory content if their "not our responsibility, contact the webmaster" response opens them up to liability.
- For those of us who put material online it might mean a more hostile legal landscape. The lesson will be that not only do you have to watch what you say online, search engines will have to do so as well.

- Milorad Trkulja sued Google, arguing when terms such as Melbourne underworld criminals were entered, images of him showed up
- An appeals court has found in favour of Google after a man claimed the search engine had defamed him by publishing photos of him linked to hardened criminals of Melbourne’s underworld.
- Milorad Trkulja sued Google, arguing when search terms such as Melbourne criminal underworld photos and Melbourne underworld criminals were entered, images of him showed up.
- He argued the search results put him in the same league as convicted murderer Carl Williams, underworld killer Andrew “Benji” Veniamin and drug kingpin Tony Mokbel.
- Google tried unsuccessfully to have the case against it set aside on the grounds it had no real prospect of success. It argued it could not be held to be the publisher of the search results, because they were produced by the automated operation of a vast web search based on algorithms. Further, it argued the search results were incapable of being found to have defamed Trkulja.
- On Tuesday, Victoria’s court of appeal ruled Google’s appeal should be allowed. “The appeal has a real, not fanciful, prospect of success,” the judges said.
- The judges held that, as the case was put, Google could not be held to be publisher of the allegedly defamatory material. They also found the material on which Trkulja sued was not capable of conveying any defamatory meanings.
- The judges acknowledged Trkulja could have argued his case in a way that enabled the appeal judges to find Google did publish the material, but he did not.
- They noted the chance for a search engine to produce results that could defame someone was “acute”. But if search engines were to have immunity from liability for defamation, it should come from the parliament rather than the courts, they said.

- The International Forum for Responsible Media Blog
- The Trkulja defamation franchise is into its fourth instalment, with the latest victory against the Google Empire coming with a stirring outcome arising from Mr Trkulja’s debut appearance in the High Court ([2018] HCA 25).
- Previously in Trkulja v Google:
- The first step was that Google immediately applied to set aside the proceeding on the basis that Trkulja had no reasonable prospects of success. The application came on before His Honour Justice McDonald in 2015. Google ran three arguments:
- Justice McDonald rejected all of Google’s submissions and the application to strike out was dismissed.
- However, fans of the Trkulja franchise will recall Episode III: The Google Empire Strikes Back. In that episode, Google appealed Justice McDonald’s decision to the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria, and three judges wrote a judgment where the appeal was allowed and Trkulja’s claim against Google was summarily dismissed.That appeared to spell the end of the Trkulja.
- The defendant was content with the outcome of Episode III
- Google was essentially successful because the Court of Appeal concluded that the images of Mr Trkulja could not be defamatory of him, being thumbnail photos of him alongside some Melbourne criminals, but also intermingled with 15 pages of photos of other people, including: actors, politicians, lawyers and a tram. The Court of Appeal concluded that no reasonable user of the internet would understand that publication of those images to mean that Mr Trkulja was a “hardened and serious criminal in Melbourne”. It also concluded that Google’s autocomplete results themselves could not convey defamatory meanings. The Google Empire succeeded.
- But Trkulja was not finished. He appealed to the High Court. Episode IV. Five judges of the High Court heard the application and have unanimously agreed that the Court of Appeal was wrong. Very wrong. And too long and complicated [36], and “unacceptable” [52]. As for Justice McDonald at first instance, he was completely right. Essentially:
- The High Court dealt with the Court of Appeal judgment swiftly and brutally. The five High Court justices unanimously made the following comments:
- The High Court concluded that even if the list of persons potentially defamed by 15 pages of image search results might be large and diverse (as relied upon by the Court of Appeal to justify its conclusions), that was not the point. The conclusion was still sound. It is arguable and that is a matter for trial.
- In one final fling, perhaps as an act of desperation, Google relied on at least one other search result for Mr Trkulja. At [65], the High Court referred to this: “on page three, a ‘snippet’ of a webpage which, under the heading, ‘Trkulja v Yahoo! – Defamation Watch” …… well that was never going to work.
- All in all, this is the first time the High Court has considered internet publication since 2001 in Gutnick v Dow Jones. The important conclusions to take from the judgment appear to be these:
- Both of these are likely to have enormous consequences for Google and other search engines in Australia. Any summary judgment application brought by Google moving forward would appear likely to fail. It will also be exposed to significant discovery obligations if it chooses to put publication in issue, or depending what other type of defence it might raise.
- Meanwhile, like all good movie franchises, they end with a victory, but also with a short teaser for the next episode that is already in the works. Nothing is ever resolved. Mr Trkulja will return to the Supreme Court of Victoria for another trial next year in Episode V, and this time, Disney might want to buy the rights….

- Former music promoter Milorad ''Michael'' Trkulja is suing Google in a bid to have his name essentially erased from the internet after the search engine continues to link him unfairly to Melbourne's criminal underworld.
- The self-described "Yugoslavian" community leader says he has taken legal action against the ''evil'' internet giant because Google has not blocked access to the material despite his win in a defamation lawsuit last year.
- The 'biggest evil' of all: Michael Trkulja wants to be removed from Google.Credit: AP
- ''I don't have any criminal record but my picture is still there next to those underworld people,'' Mr Trkulja told Fairfax Media. ''Even if you're an angel, people will think there's smoke or fire there.''
- ''Fining Google $200,000 is like charging you or me 20 cents. This time I want them to remove my name from Google.''
- Trkulja says he's been wrongly associated with gangland figures this had taken its toll on his life.
- Mr Trkulja came to public attention in 2004 when he was shot in the back by an balaclava-wearing assailant while eating Sunday lunch with his mother in a St Albans restaurant. He narrowly avoided being shot a second time because the gun jammed.
- The attack came in the midst of Melbourne's gangland war and when Mr Trkulja's name was subsequently typed into Google, his photo appeared alongside underworld figures such as drug kingpin Tony Mokbel.
- When Google repeatedly refused to remove links to the images, Mr Trkulja successfully sued the internet giant for defamation and received $200,000 in damages in 2012. That followed an earlier legal victory against Yahoo where he was awarded $225,000.
- But Mr Trkulja's latest defamation lawsuit claims his reputation is still being ''gravely injured'' by continuing to be linked to the underworld via Google's image search and autocomplete functions.
- In a 20-page print out tendered to the Supreme court, Mr Trkulja claims his photo appears alongside Tony Mokbel, gangland identity Mick Gatto, and Moran crime family matriarch Judy Moran under search terms such as ''Melbourne underworld criminals photos''.
- ''The Google Web matter is defamatory and in its true innuendo carries the defamatory imputations [that Mr Trkulja] is a hardened and serious criminal in Melbourne, in the same league as late [drug kingpin] Carl Williams, [hitman] Andrew ''Benji'' Veniamin, Tony Mokbel murderer and drug trafficker,'' the claim stated.
- Mr Trkulja decided to launch the latest lawsuit after Google's legal department declined to take any action to block access to the photos despite his 2012 court win.
- ''Google says 'do no evil' but they are the biggest evil,'' he said.
- Mr Trkulja has petitioned the Supreme Court to grant a permanent injunction that would remove his name from Google's servers and any links to the images or other online materials. He is also seeking $355,000 in damages.
- An injunction may prevent Google from linking to the materials in search results but the original images and webpages would continue to exist on the internet and be acccessible directly or through other search engines, industry sources say.
- A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment.

- A man who was the victim of a shooting has won the right to sue Google for defamation in the High Court of Australia.
- Milorad 'Michael' Trkulja, from Melbourne, successfully argued that he was defamed by the tech giant after they published images of him that linked to Melbourne underworld criminals - between 2012 and 2014.
- On Wednesday, the High Court judgement agreed with these claims as search engine results could suggest to the public that he was 'somehow associated with the Melbourne criminal underworld'.
- Milorad 'Michael' Trkulja (pictured) was victorious in a court case at the High Court of Australia, receiving approval to sue Google for defamation
- Trkulja who was shot in the back in 2004, commenced his legal battle in 2012 at the Victorian Supreme Court. While he was initially successful with the case, the court overturned their decision four years later, deeming the case was unlikely to prove defamation.
- Mr Trkulja said that he will not end his legal battle until he gets the result he desires as he is fearful his grandchildren could come across the images that imply criminality.
- 'I'm not a criminal, I've never been involved and I will make sure these people are not going to ruin my family - I have grandchildren,' he told AAP.
- In March, Trkulja's lawyer, Guy Reynolds, told the High Court that Google searches of Trkulja also bring up images of gangland figures Tony Mokbel, Mick Gatto, Carl Williams, Chopper Reid, Mario Condello and Mark and Jason Moran.
- In opposition to this argument, Google's lawyers labelled it 'irrational' for someone to link Trkulja as an underworld figure as images of crime victims, movie posters, actors and the Google logo could all appear under the same search.
- Mr Trkulja also argued defamation on Google's 'autocomplete' function which provided suggestions for his name, including: 'is a former hit man', 'criminal' and 'underworld'.
- The court heard Trkulja's claims that he was defamed by the internet giant as google searches link him to the Melbourne criminal underworld
- The court heard, however, that this is an automatic function based on previous searches.
- This is not the first time Google has faced defamation claims and cases.
- In 2015, Daily Mail Australia reported on a landmark victory for Adelaide woman, Dr Janice Duffy. The academic claimed that Google defamed her, after material was posted online to 'Ripoff Report' in 2007.
- In opposition to Trkulja's claims, Google's lawyers argued it was 'irrational' to link him as the search would also show crime victims, actors and the Google logo
- This is not the first case of defamation against Google. In 2015, an academic from Adelaide won a case against the internet giant

- High Court allows Milorad Trkulja to sue Google for defamation over images linked to crime bosses
- A man who claims to be defamed by Google has now been given the green light to sue the search engine by the High Court.
- Milorad Trkulja was shot in the back by an unknown gunman in Melbourne in 2004, at the time of a series of underworld killings.
- He wants to sue Google for defamation after discovering that searches for his name brought up images of mob figures due to the shooting coinciding with gangland activity in the city.
- The images wrongly linked Mr Trkulja with crime bosses including Tony Mokbel.
- Mr Trkulja said he had only ever seen Mokbel on television and in newspapers and the only contact he knew he had had with an underworld figure was a chance meeting with Mick Gatto.
- "I was with my ex-solicitor George Defteros, who was also acting at the same time [for] Mick Gatto," he said.
- "We were having lunch in Lygon Street and on the way home we passed Mick Gatto sitting there and we just shook hands."
- Mr Trkulja's efforts to sue Google had been blocked by a Victorian Court of Appeal decision, but on Wednesday the High Court ruled in his favour.
- He said he was "over the moon" with the High Court's decision in his lengthy "David-and-Goliath battle".
- Mr Trkulja first sued Google for defamation in 2012 and won.
- He began another proceeding after alleging that defamatory text, autocomplete predictions and images showed him alongside convicted felons when searching phrases such as "Melbourne underworld criminals".
- Autocomplete predictions are the suggestions that appear under the searcher's text before they have finished typing.
- A Victorian Court of Appeal agreed with Google that the case had no real prospect of successfully proving defamation.
- But in 2017, the High Court granted him special leave to appeal against that decision.
- Google tried to stop the High Court case, saying it had not published allegedly defamatory search results, that the search results were not defamatory of Mr Trkulja, and that it was entitled to immunity.
- But the High Court on Wednesday found there was clearly potential for defamation.
- "There is no evidence here … that it would have been apparent to an ordinary reasonable person using the Google search engine that Google made no contribution to the elements of those search results that convey a connection between Mr Trkulja and criminality," the unanimous judgement said.
- "The most obvious, logical connection between the terms of the search and the response, under headings such as 'Melbourne criminal underworld photos', 'Melbourne underworld crime' and 'Melbourne underworld killings', or at least some of them, are criminals or members of the Melbourne criminal underworld."
- The court acknowledged the argument by Google's lawyers that some of the images were not criminal figures — including a former Victorian Chief Commissioner of Police and Marlon Brando in his role as the Godfather.
- "But in each of the pages on which images of such persons appear, there are also images of persons who are notorious criminals or members of the Melbourne criminal underworld … coupled with images of persons, such as Mr Trkulja whose identity is relatively unknown," the judgement said.
- A spokesperson for Google said the company "will continue to defend the claim", but would not comment further on ongoing legal matters.
- Legal expert Nicolas Suzor said the decision was exciting, as it might provide clarity on unanswered questions around how defamation laws are applied online.
- "At the moment, defamation law — it's a bit of a mess," the Queensland University of Technology associate professor said.
- "It's not exactly clear at the moment when an internet publisher will be responsible for removing content that could be defamatory."
- He said if the case was to go to trial in the Victorian Supreme Court, the legal system, individuals and internet giants like Google may all get some answers.
- "The fact that the High Court has taken an interest here doesn't necessarily mean that Google is going to lose when the full trial goes through," he said.
- "What it means is that the High Court is interested enough in this problem to consider it.
- "And that's a positive sign because of how difficult and complex defamation law has become in Australia."

- A judge in Australia this week ordered Google to pay $208,000 ($200,000 in Australian dollars) to a man who accused the company of defaming him with search results that associated him with crime organizations. The man, 62-year-old Milorad Trkulja, first confronted Google in 2009, five years after he was shot at a restaurant in an unsolved crime. Subsequent searches for Trkulja's name turned up many results that associated him with Australian mobsters and organized crime operations, with some sites claiming he was shot as part of a professional hit.
- Trkulja's lawyers asked Google to take action against this "grossly defamatory content" in October 2009, and eventually brought their case to the Supreme Court of Victoria. Google denied any wrongdoing, claiming it was simply pointing to material that others had published, and arguing that its search results took Trkulja's claims of defamation into account, as well. The jury disagreed, however, determining on October 31st that Google should have acted after being notified by Trkulja's legal team.
- Equating Google with newsstands
- Trkulja won a defamation case against Yahoo concerning the same incident earlier this year, though this month's victory could have significant implications for Google, which has faced similar lawsuits in France and Germany. In his ruling, Judge David Beach defended the jury's decision, equating Google with libraries or newsstands, which can sometimes be held liable under Australia's defamation laws.
- "Google Inc. is like the newsagent that sells a newspaper containing a defamatory article," Beach said. "While there might be no specific intention to publish defamatory material, there is a relevant intention by the newsagent to publish the newspaper for the purposes of the law of defamation."
- Google, meanwhile, insists that it shouldn't be held responsible for material published by others, and is reportedly considering an appeal. "Google's search results are a reflection of the content and information that is available on the web," the company said in a statement. "The sites in Google's search results are controlled by those sites' webmasters, not by Google."

          / AP
- CANBERRA, Australia -- An Australian man who alleges Google defamed him on Wednesday won a court battle to sue the search engine giant. Milorad "Michael" Trkulja was shot in the back in 2004 in a restaurant in Melbourne, Australia's second largest city.
- The Australian High Court unanimously ruled in favor of Trkulja, supporting his allegation that a Google search of his name could indicate to an ordinary person he was "somehow associated with the Melbourne criminal underworld."
- Trkulja had successfully argued in the Victoria state Supreme Court in 2012 that Google defamed him by publishing photos of him linked to hardened criminals of Melbourne's underworld.
- Four years later, the Victorian Court of Appeal overturned the decision, finding the case had no prospect of successfully proving defamation. The High Court disputed that ruling and ordered Google to pay Trkulja's legal costs.
- Google searches for "Melbourne criminal underworld photos" bring up images of Trkulja alongside gangland figures, his lawyer Guy Reynolds told the High Court in March.
- However, Google's lawyers argued it would be "irrational" for someone to assume photos in a Google image search for underworld figures are all of criminals, because the same search would also bring up the Google logo, movie posters, images of crime victims and photos of actor Marlon Brando.
- Trkulja is also claiming defamation around Google's "autocomplete" options for his name, which have included phrases like "is a former hit man," ''criminal" and "underworld."
- However, the court heard autocomplete is an automatic function and that previous searches influence future suggestions.
- The defamation suit is expected to go back to the Victoria Supreme Court for trial.
- Trkulja said he would continue the legal action until he gets the result he wants, fearful someone will see the images and tell his grandchildren he's a hardened criminal.
- "I will sue Google ... and I will sue them till they stop. I want them to block my pictures," he said. "I'm not a criminal, I've never been involved and I will make sure these people are not going to ruin my family - I have grandchildren," he added.
- Google said in a statement: "We will continue to defend the claim. We decline to comment further on ongoing legal matters."
