- A 'Safe City' initiative in the Burmese capital Naypyidaw that uses a system of 335 cameras with face recognition capabilities across eight townships poses a 'serious threat to basic rights' in the country, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW).
- The system comprises Huawei CCTC cameras equipped with facial recognition and vehicle license plate recognition in public places and alerts authorities to people with criminal histories. Local companies Linn IT Solution are providing the control center, and Naung Yoe to install cameras and communication cables.
- Huawei later denied that it provided the facial and license plate recognition technologies, and that it is 'not involved in any actual operation and data storage or processing.' But the firm avoided saying whether it sold the government CCTV cameras and associated equipment without these technologies, or had subcontracted the installation of these technologies to other suppliers.
- Huawei has also signed a contract to provide the same system to the Mandalay Safe City project, covering three of Mandalay’s seven townships.
- HRW warned the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces risks the misidentification of people, creates 'potential chilling effects on freedoms of expression, association, and assembly', and can be used to single out individuals in discriminatory or arbitrary ways, including for their ethnicity or religion.
- A February 2021 coup saw Myanmar's military seizing power after detaining Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratically elected leaders, prompting waves of street protests and violence.
- For HRW researcher Manny Maung, 'This powerful surveillance system bolsters the Myanmar junta’s increasingly abusive crackdown on demonstrations. The authorities’ ability to identify people on the streets, potentially track their movements and relationships, and intrude into private lives poses a grave risk to anti-coup activists.'
- HRW and others noted that the local authorities provide little information on how facial, vehicle license plate and other personal data will be collected, stored, and used. Nor they clarify which officials will be given access to that data and under what circumstances.
- Myanmar has no privacy law covering sensitive or biometric personal information.

- (Bangkok) – The Myanmar military junta’s access to a new public camera system equipped with facial recognition and license plate recognition technology poses a serious threat to basic rights in the country, Human Rights Watch said today. Increased surveillance abilities through artificial intelligence technology are a heightened concern after the February 1 military coup, as the junta has increasingly used deadly force against protesters and others expressing opposing views.
On December 14, 2020, Myanmar authorities rolled out the first phase of its “Safe City” initiative and started using a system of 335 surveillance cameras in eight townships in the capital, Naypyidaw. The cameras, from the technology company Huawei, come installed with artificial intelligence technology that automatically scans faces and vehicle license plates in public places and alerts authorities to those on a wanted list. Myanmar’s Safe City plan envisions similar systems in Mandalay by mid-2021, and later, in Yangon, the commercial capital.  
“This powerful surveillance system bolsters the Myanmar junta’s increasingly abusive crackdown on demonstrations,” said Manny Maung, Asia researcher. “The authorities’ ability to identify people on the streets, potentially track their movements and relationships, and intrude into private lives poses a grave risk to anti-coup activists.”
Most of the equipment used in Myanmar’s US$1.2 million project is produced by Huawei, according to a government official cited by Myanmar Now. The same report said that the Naypyidaw-based Linn IT Solutions won the tender to build the control center, and Nang Yoe was selected to install the cameras and communications cables. In a letter to Human Rights Watch dated February 22, Huawei said that as a telecoms supplier, it is providing “standard ICT infrastructure equipment” – referring to information and communications technology – suggesting that the company supplied the CCTV cameras.
Huawei stated that the facial and license plate recognition technology installed on the cameras was not from Huawei: “[T]here are many vendors for different parts of the projects. The application software you paid attention to is not Huawei products. And more important, Huawei is not involved in any actual operation and data storage or processing.” However, Huawei did not clarify whether it sold the government CCTV cameras and associated equipment without these technologies, or had subcontracted the installation of these technologies to other suppliers. 
The Naypidaw and Mandalay Safe City projects have been planned since 2018 and 2019, respectively. In March 2019, the Mandalay Region’s chief minister announced plans for a $1.24 million Safe City project designed in partnership with Huawei, claiming it would heighten security and curb criminal activity.
The proposal for the Safe City project in Mandalay, Myanmar’s second largest city, envisions that Huawei will provide CCTV recording equipment and software, oversee the installation by commissioning third-party contractors, and provide technical support to the Mandalay regional government. In both the Naypyidaw and Mandalay projects, there is little transparency regarding how facial images, vehicle license plate information, and other personal data will be collected, stored, and used. Nor is it clear which officials will be given access to that data and under what circumstances. The replacement of the civilian-elected government by a military junta heightens rights concerns, Human Rights Watch said.
The use of facial recognition technology in public spaces does not merely risk the misidentification of people as criminal suspects, Human Rights Watch said. Even if the technology is accurate, it allows governments to monitor people’s habits and movements, creating potential chilling effects on freedoms of expression, association, and assembly. It can also be used to single out individuals in discriminatory or arbitrary ways, including for their ethnicity or religion.
For example, in China, various technologies including facial recognition and number plate recognition have been used for mass surveillance purposes. Their use is particularly abusive in China’s Xinjiang region, where these systems continually assess the relationships and everyday behavior of Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority. These systems help identify people whom authorities consider “problematic” based on vague criteria following which they are detained, imprisoned, and subjected to political indoctrination.
In Myanmar, the rollout of facial recognition and vehicle license plate recognition technology was approved without public consultation or transparency, making it unclear how the authorities plan to mitigate the technology’s potential impact on human rights, including the right to privacy.  
On February 13, the military junta suspended sections 5, 7, and 8 of the Law Protecting the Privacy and Security of Citizens (2017), removing basic protections, including the right to be free from arbitrary detention and the right to be free of warrantless surveillance, search, and seizure.
Section 5 required the presence of two witnesses whenever the police enter a residence for the purposes of search or seizure “to ensure that there is no damage to the privacy or security of the citizen.” The suspension of that protection significantly raises the risk of abuses during searches and arrests. Section 7 required a court order for any detention of more than 24 hours. Suspension of the provision will facilitate violations of international law, which provides that any person detained on a criminal charge be brought promptly before a judge.
Section 8 provided protections of an individual’s right to privacy by prohibiting search and seizure, surveillance, spying, or any investigation affecting the privacy, security, and dignity of the individual without a court order, protections that the junta has removed.
Neither the privacy law nor other Myanmar law contains any protection for the collection, use and storage of personal data. There is also no specific protection of sensitive personal data, including biometrics, or their processing.
Under international law, government collection or use of personal and sensitive data, including vehicle license plate numbers and biometrics, must comply with international human rights standards, specifically the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in article 17, that “no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence” and that “everyone has the right to protection of the law against such interference or attacks.” Even though Myanmar has not ratified the ICCPR, these protections are also provided in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which are considered reflective of customary international law.
Myanmar authorities should ensure that each instance of collection, retention, and use of personal data is comprehensively regulated, narrow in scope, and necessary as well as proportionate to meeting a legitimate security goal. The government should also refrain from deploying facial recognition systems altogether given that the collection and analysis of facial images creates unprecedented risks to privacy and related rights.
Under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, technology companies also have a responsibility to ensure that their products and services do not contribute to human rights abuses, including violations of privacy.
“Before the coup, Myanmar’s government tried to justify mass surveillance technologies in the name of fighting crime, but what it is doing is empowering an abusive military junta,” Maung said. “The rollout of these technologies should be suspended given the risks involved and the possibility of further rights abuses.”

- 
- Facial recognition software developed by Belarusian software design company LLC Synesis and implemented by the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, as well as by other European companies, is being used to track and identify dissidents in Belarus, reports Kharon.
- Kipod uses advanced biometric machine learning algorithms to analyse material from a variety of sources. Synesis was previously sanctioned by the European Union for providing authorities with an AI surveillance platform to track individuals, after which Synesis was restructured and several affiliated companies changed their name.
- Nikolai Dedok, a prominent Belarusian protester was arrested last year after reportedly being identified by Kipod’s technology, and proceeded to leak a list of Synesis employees, criticizing them for failing to inform the Belarusian people about the potential dangers of the facial recognition system.
- Over 2,400 protest-linked cases have been opened since last summer, according to the Belarusian media, following demonstrations against the president’s re-election. Sanctions were declared against Belarus following the presidential elections.
- According to the technology’s website, Kipod is designed for biometric transport security, public safety, epidemiological monitoring and critical infrastructure security, and the system can also track individual or vehicle movements.
- Synesis has denied that the technology could be used by the Belarusian government to identify anti-government protesters, however the company’s products are used as the basis of Belarusian surveillance techniques, according to the report. President Lukashenko signed a decree to establish an official system of public safety monitoring via video surveillance, run by a subsidiary of Synesis and built on the Kipod programming platform.
- Kipod is also in use in Moscow’s metro system, as well as at filling stations in Ireland and the UK. A Canadian large-scale machinery manufacturer also uses the technology at its Northern Ireland logistics centers.
- The use of facial recognition has come under pressure, particularly during the global pandemic, to implement guidelines and regulations in order to increase safer usage and decrease potential biases. Though the European Commission is in the process of developing EU-wide laws, face biometrics use by law enforcement has not been banned in public spaces, and Belarus is not a member of the EU or the Schengen area.
- Greek police will be equipped with portable, smartphone-like devices capable of capturing biometric information to identify people while on patrol, reports The World. This follows a 2017 Smart Policing plan for around 1000 police officers to use the devices by summer 2021; eventually the devices could be distributed to up to 10,000 officers.
- Aimed at scanning faces and fingerprints, one of the project’s goals is to identify third-country nationals who may have overstayed a legal permit in Greece, according to a (Greek language) police document.
- Though the devices will be connected to both European and Greek databases, the data collected will not be retained in the system, says a Hellenic Police spokesperson: “…used exclusively for their instantaneous comparison with the existing systems of the Greek Police and will be discarded upon completion of the identification process.”
- The plan has been largely criticized by privacy and human rights groups as potentially unlawful under European laws of biometric data processing. The European Commission’s Internal Security Fund (ISF) is funding approximately 75 percent of the project in Greece.
- “I am not saying that we should never use new technology in policing activities or law enforcement, in general. What I’m saying is that it’s very important to invest in technologies that are human rights-oriented and that there are legal grounds to use such technologies,” says Eleftherios Chelioudakis, co-founder of Homo Digitales, a digital rights advocacy organization.
- Greek police say that the plan will improve working efficiency and officer safety. The organization European Digital Rights (EDRi) launched a petition last year to ban the use of “biometric mass surveillance” and called for more regulations of biometric technologies in Europe. While large U.S. corporations like Microsoft, IBM and Amazon have stated that sales of facial recognition technology to law enforcement will be restricted until there is a federal law regulating its use.
- The European Data Protection Authority (EDPA) are currently preparing a set of guidelines for the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement; while the European Commission works on establishing standards for the regulation of AI and biometrics. It is yet unclear how stringent these guidelines may be.
- In December, Myanmar’s government installed over 300 AI-equipped surveillance cameras across the capital as part of the first phase of the country’s Safe City Initiative. This initiative, which includes both facial recognition and vehicle license plate recognition, went ahead without public consultation, and could be used as a tool of repression according to Human Rights Watch.
- Though Huawei is providing some equipment to the initiative, the tech giant has contradicted the statement that the facial recognition and license plate technology in use have been provided by Huawei. Yet, Huawei and Myanmar’s government are previously reported to have signed a contract to partner in implementing the same technology in the city of Mandalay, reportedly costing $1.5 million. The expansion to Mandalay is planned for mid-2021.
- “This powerful surveillance system bolsters the Myanmar junta’s increasingly abusive crackdown on demonstrations. The authorities’ ability to identify people on the streets, potentially track their movements and relationships, and intrude into private lives poses a grave risk to anti-coup activists,” says Manny Muang, Asia researcher.
- It is unclear exactly what information will be stored or used for, nor who will be able to access the data, but several legal restrictions on law enforcement have been suspended by the junta.
- In 2019, Myanmar’s Ministry of Transport and Communications announced the mandatory biometric data collection when purchasing a new mobile phone; part of a government initiative to create a massive national database. Similarly, uses of the data were not specified, nor transparency about whether the move could be connected to government digital identity plans. Civil society organizations expressed concern over the potential misuse of the systems, while the Myanmar’s Posts and Telecommunications Department replied that a legal framework around biometrics was in development.
- Human Rights Watch condemns the use of facial recognition in public spaces due to the direct effect this may have on both collective public and individual behaviour. These concerns come following a military coup in the country on February 1st where protestors clashed with Myanmar’s military junta. Furthermore, there is currently no Myanmar law which covers protection of sensitive or biometric data, according to HRW.

- A total of 335 cameras with face recognition capabilities went live last week in the Myanmar capital of Naypyitaw, Myanmar Now reports.
- The system, which facial recognition algorithms were developed by tech giant Huawei, cost roughly $2.9 million and is capable of recognizing faces, as well as vehicles’ number plates.
- “Anyone with a criminal history entering Naypyitaw will be recognized.” Myint Swe, the top advisor for the Naypyitaw Safe City project, told Myanmar Now, describing the new biometric surveillance system.
- Naypyitaw started working on the new system last year, calling for companies to join the project.
- Huawei is involved through a partner. Among the companies who applied, Linn IT Solution was tasked to build the control center, and Naung Yoe was chosen to install cameras and communication cables.
- The new control center, which can keep footage for sixty days, is operating under the control of the city police, with guidance from a group led by Dr. Myo Aung, the chair of the Naypyitaw Council.
- A contract has also been signed between Huawei and the government to provide the same facial recognition technology to the Mandalay Safe City project, at an approximate cost of $1.5 million. The project will cover three of Mandalay’s seven townships.
- Smart surveillance system to be installed in Varanasi
- Around 3000 surveillance cameras will be installed at 720 locations in Varanasi, India, as part of a Smart City project, Hindustan Times reports.
- Among the devices, there will also be 22 facial recognition cameras, connected to the Kashi Integrated Command Control Centre (KICCC).
- The system, which according to Varanasi Smart City CEO Gaurang Rathi, is worth roughly $17.4 million, is being built with technology from India, Europe, and the U.S.
- Speaking to the Hindustan Times, Rathi said that installation works related to the new system have started in July, with the optical fiber line currently being laid.
- The Smart City CEO added that the new, smart surveillance system should be operational by March next year.

- By HEIN THAR | FRONTIER Photos THUYA ZAW
- NOVEMBER roughly corresponds to the Myanmar month of Tazaungmone, which has more festivals than any other month on the traditional calendar, most of them related to Buddhism. They include Kathina, the festival of lights known as Tazaungdaing, and the enjoyable neighbourhood event known as Neibban Zay Pwe Daw.
- A Neibban Zay event brings communities together to create a charitable market to which anyone may donate goods. It takes place on neighbourhood streets on the full moon day of Tazaungmone and the following day. Neibban in Burmese corresponds to the Sanskrit word Nirvana (or Nibbana in Pali), which denotes the transcendent state in Buddhism where suffering and the individual self dissolves, while zay means market.
- Participating households usually donate a particular commodity in varying quantities, which they disburse from one of a line of stalls set up on the street. Those who wish to scoop up these items form a queue, often long, at a temporary stage or mandat located at one end of the street, from where event organisers hand out tokens.
- Written on each token is the street number or name of a particular donating household, meaning the bearer is entitled to whatever this household chose to donate. The tokens are shuffled before being handed out, so that the recipients cannot know in advance what they’ll be getting.

- Depending on the financial circumstances of the households that take part, the items they donate can range from cans of Coca-Cola or a traditional snack to more expensive consumer goods. For each can of coke or snack item on offer, there’s a separate token, and a single household may offer more than 100.
- After the donor has been tracked down at the relevant stall along the street and the gift handed over, the recipient may retrace his or her steps and re-join the queue to try their luck again. They can do this as many times as they like until the last token has been distributed.
- Neibban Zay feels like a game, but sometimes the mood of playful competition turns.

- 
- Long queues and frustrated expectations about free gifts can lead to tensions, as occurred in a ward in Yangon’s northeastern South Okkapala Township last year. An argument that began in a queue escalated into pushing and shoving and almost became a brawl.
- The ward’s Innwa Street is home to about 100 prosperous families and it is common for them to donate thousands of items for Neibban Zay, including higher value ones such as rice cookers, crockery and even bicycles.
- The chance of receiving high-value gifts attracts a long queue to the mandat in Innwa Street, mostly made up of ward residents, but there are visitors from other, poorer wards.
- “I come here to queue every year, and I queue in nearby wards as well,” said Daw Aye Myint Kyu, a resident of No. 6 Ward in South Okkalapa. “If I receive food, I eat it, but it’s better if I get utensils,” she told Frontier.
- Such comments are common among those who join queues at Neibban Zay events in towns and cities throughout the country. In areas where very wealthy people live and the donated items are rumoured to include refrigerators, TVs, cash and even jewellery, queues can be long and raucous.
- It is strict queue etiquette that once a person has received their token and gift, if they want another go, they need to return to the end of the queue. Resentment brews and arguments start when people try to push their way to the front. The queue jumpers are called kyar pyat thu, which means “interloper”, and they spoil the fun-fair atmosphere.
- “Some queue jumpers get as many as 40 or 50 tokens; it is not fair for those who observe queue etiquette,” said Ko Kyaw Soe, a donor and organiser at the event in Innwa Street, South Okkapala.
- He told Frontier that some kyar pyat thu further abuse the spirit of the festival by selling-off the goods they receive. “It is an abuse of the donations. We, as donors, want what we have given to go to those who will appreciate it.”

- 
- Kyaw Soe has tried diverse ways to control the queue jumpers.
- For the previous two years, those queuing to receive the tokens for the first time had their little finger marked with ink. However, unscrupulous people were able to wipe off the ink and barge their way back to the front of the queue right after receiving a gift.
- “I tried many methods but none of them worked. However, this year the queuing ran smoothly thanks to a new technology,” Kyaw Soe said.
- A week before the Neibban Zay event on Innwa Street began on November 12, Kyaw Soe called all the neighbourhood residents together and scanned their faces with the Luxand Face Recognition app on his iPad. The facial recognition app assigned each person a number, creating a visual register of everyone who was allowed to take part in the event.
- On the day, as each person reached the front of the queue, their faces were scanned by the app to verify their place on the register before being issued with a token. In this way, he was able to ensure that no one was able to receive more than five tokens, and that participation was limited to local residents, with interlopers barred from taking part.
- Kyaw Soe was delighted to be able to distribute five tokens each to 1,800 people. Everyone in the community, including young children and the elderly, got their fair share at an event where 92 households donated 9,000 items. “Many people tried to queue again [after receiving their fifth token], but they were thwarted by the technology,” he said, laughing.
- But Kyaw Soe is already thinking about how he can fine-tune his system for an even smoother Neibban Zay next year.
- “Next year, I’m going to buy a finger-scanning machine. It will be faster and more accurate,” he said.

- The Myanmar military junta’s access to a new public camera system equipped with facial recognition and license plate recognition technology poses a serious threat to basic rights in the country, Human Rights Watch said today. Increased surveillance abilities through artificial intelligence technology are a heightened concern after the February 1 military coup, as the junta has increasingly used deadly force against protesters and others expressing opposing views.
- On December 14, 2020, Myanmar authorities rolled out the first phase of its “Safe City” initiative and started using a system of 335 surveillance cameras in eight townships in the capital, Naypyidaw. The cameras, from the technology company Huawei, come installed with artificial intelligence technology that automatically scans faces and vehicle license plates in public places and alerts authorities to those on a wanted list. Myanmar’s Safe City plan envisions similar systems in Mandalay by mid-2021, and later, in Yangon, the commercial capital.

The same report said that the Naypyidaw-based Linn IT Solutions won the tender to build the control center, and Nang Yoe was selected to install the cameras and communications cables. In a letter to Human Rights Watch dated February 22, Huawei said that as a telecoms supplier, it is providing “standard ICT infrastructure equipment” – referring to information and communications technology – suggesting that the company supplied the CCTV cameras.
- Huawei stated that the facial and license plate recognition technology installed on the cameras was not from Huawei: “[T]here are many vendors for different parts of the projects. The application software you paid attention to is not Huawei products. And more important, Huawei is not involved in any actual operation and data storage or processing.” However, Huawei did not clarify whether it sold the government CCTV cameras and associated equipment without these technologies, or had subcontracted the installation of these technologies to other suppliers.

- Naypyitaw – Over 4 billion kyats (US$2.7 million) worth of CCTV cameras will be added to the security apparatus in Naypyitaw, according to Lower House lawmaker U Than Soe Aung of Pyinmana Township in Naypyitaw.
- The cameras will be installed with funds from the Naypyitaw Council, the executive body of the Naypyitaw Union Territory, which is directly responsible to the President.
- Parliamentary approval has been sought to allow 4.1 billion kyats to be spent in the 2019-20 budget upgrading the capital’s security system, said U Than Soe Aung.
- He said the Naypyitaw Council would not reveal how and where the cameras would be installed.
- Twelve companies have submitted proposals to the Naypyitaw Council.
- “We submitted a proposal on Dec. 16. [The council] has not yet replied,” said the owner of Linn IT Solution Co Ltd, which is based in Naypyitaw.
- The market price of a CCTV camera is between 50,000 and 100,000 kyats ($34-$68). The tender winners will be responsible for installing the police-controlled cameras and surveillance system.
- According to tender procedures issued by the President’s Office in 2017, for security matters related to the armed forces, prisons and procurement, the government can only make purchases from recognized suppliers.
- The cameras are due to be installed by September.
- The police said more than 400 surveillance cameras were already monitoring public locations in Naypyitaw.
- The control center is at the Naypyitaw police headquarters.

- Huawei is one of the tech companies that governments worldwide are collaborating with to reshape our public spaces. We have been working on mapping out the development of Huawei Smart City initiatives around the world and have been mobilising other actors to join this effort.

- The smart city market is booming. And with a booming market comes companies that are profiting and reshaping our public space, like the Chinese tech company Huawei.
- While the term ‘Smart City’ is a broad one that encompasses many different initiatives, some with little to no impact on our privacy and other rights. Certain issues are nevertheless recurrent: the lack of transparency around public-private partnerships, the absence of consultation, and the appetite for a “tech quick fix” – regardless of its efficiency or efficacy – over more costly systemic changes.
- And when companies reshape our cities, the lines between private and public spaces get blurred and such projects can contribute to normalising surveillance.
- These firms are undermining the protections that exist when surveillance is undertaken by authorities accountable to the public. As we will highlight below, in the context of Huawei’s contracts, companies are invited or volunteer to team up with police and law enforcement agencies to install CCTV systems, provide management systems for personal data or even carry out policing functions traditionally entrusted to the state. They sometimes do it at no initial cost to the city, to lure local governments into using their products, sometimes leaving organisations or governments trapped in an expensive – and difficult to escape– ecosystem.
- Huawei is particularly representative of the concerns we have been highlighting regarding public-private partnerships and smart cities in particular. Huawei has built more than 160 Smart Cities in over 100 countries and regions. Depending on the country, different administrative laws and standards of data protection apply. The level of involvement from Huawei also varies from one project to another.
Governments can source these solutions with little to no transparency, which increases the risk that some governments may use them to control their population and threaten their fundamental rights.
- This report is an overview of some cases we have identified across the world, which illustrate the range of issues inherent to Huawei’s smart city projects.
- The risks for human rights is probably nowhere clearer than in Myanmar, where the country has developed a “Safe City” initiative in the capital Naypyidaw. As part of this initiative, the government has rolled out 335 CCTV cameras, sold by Huawei, and in addition, “artificial intelligence technology that automatically scans faces and vehicle license plates in public places and alerts authorities to those on a wanted list,” according to Human Rights Watch. While Huawei argues that they are not the ones providing the facial recognition and license plate recognition technology, they remain a key actor in the surveillance of the city, as without the cameras the AI would be useless. Myanmar also plans to deploy similar systems in the cities of Mandalay and Yangon this year.
- Myanmar has no data protection or surveillance legislation. The spread of surveillance technology is all the more concerning considering the current context, where a military coup has led to citizens taking to the streets and facing violent repression. As of March 31st 2021, 510 people have been killed since the start of the coup on February 1st 2021, the victims have included children and babies.
- In Uganda the government has a running contract with Huawei to supply and install CCTV cameras, including facial recognition cameras, along major highways within the capital, Kampala, and other cities. The procurement and use of these cameras are being shielded from public scrutiny. There are also reports from the Wall Street Journal on how Huawei helped the current government hack into the communications of one opposition leader. Furthermore, the police plan on integrating the smart city systems with other key agencies, including the revenue office, identification authority, and immigration office. Our partner Unwanted Witness continues to demand the observance of international human rights law in the deployment of surveillance to safeguard human rights, freedoms, and democracy in Uganda.
- In Serbia, Huawei has also made an appearance to further extend the government’s surveillance reach. In early 2019, the Minister of Interior and the Police Director announced that Belgrade will receive “a thousand” smart surveillance cameras with face and license plate recognition capabilities. SHARE Foundation sent freedom of information requests to the Serbian Ministry of Interior, asking for information on locations of the cameras and details on the public procurement and relevant procedures. The official response of the Ministry stated that all the documents regarding the public procurement of the video equipment are protected as “confidential”, while the decision to install these cameras was made with no public debate or transparency.
- Spain boasts more than one Smart City initiatives with Huawei. In Rivas Vaciamadrid, a city outside of Madrid, Huawei has modernised the “nervous system” of the city to facilitate the transmission of information to the police. The local government purchased Huawei’s “eLTE Broadband Trunking Solution,” which, according to Huawei’s website, provides the police with “multimedia trunking, video dispatching, High-Definition wireless video surveillance, real-time distribution and backhaul of HD videos and pictures.” Multimedia trunking is the ability to centralise media and to allow the police better and quicker access to CCTV footage.
- In order to go beyond the public narrative pushed by Huawei and better understand how these partnerships develop, we decided to file a Freedom of Information (“FOI”) request to Rivas Vaciamadrid. If you want to learn more about filing FOI requests, you can read our guide here.
- We asked Rivas Vaciamadrid:
- 1)    To disclose a copy of all available contracts between the Ayuntamiento Rivas-Vaciamadrid and Huawei from 2015 until now.
- 2)    To share with us all brochures, promotional documents, presentations and handbooks provided by Huawei to the Ayuntamiento of Rivas-Vaciamadrid from 2015 until now.
- 3)    If the city of Rivas-Vaciamadrid conducted any risk or human rights impact assessments, including any privacy or data protection impact assessments, prior to signing any contract with Huawei. If so, to share a copy of them.
- 4)    Based on slide 10/20 of the presentation available here:
 a. If they could confirm if any Huawei software and/or hardware is involved in the process of smart video analysis.
 b. To clarify how this smart video analysis is conducted.
 c. To clarify what the purposes that smart video analysis is used for are.
- Despite our multiple follow-ups, we never received a response from Rivas Vaciamadrid.
- In November 2019, an announcement from Huawei revealed that the city of Barcelona had signed a letter of intention during an event called the Smart City Expo World Congress. The letter was a promise that the Barcelona City Council would collaborate with Huawei on technology projects in the city. The announcement offered no detail over the nature of the promise and what specifically the partnership would entail, but promised it would include “innovative technologies developed by Huawei, such as 5G, SmartCity applications, and Digital Transformation in Barcelona.”
- We decided to ask the city of Barcelona to provide us with this letter of intention via a FOI request and they did comply with the request. You can find it in the attached file on the side bar.
- The letter of Intention between Barcelona and Huawei is a promise to “explore opportunities of collaborations in the application of new technologies in urban areas and the quality of life. Examples of possible collaborative initiatives can be: 5G Barcelona European Initiatives, SmartCity Use Case Initiatives, Advanced investigation and development through Supercomputing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance Digital Transformation, etc.”
- In France, the city of Valenciennes, in the north of the country, caught media attention for its peculiar partnership with Huawei back in 2017. Huawei offered the city 240 facial recognition cameras, worth two million euros, for free. Note that live facial recognition is not generally authorised in France, therefore according to city officials, the facial recognition features of the camera are not used. To find out more about the involvement of Huawei in Valenciennes read our research here.
- With an increasing appetite from public authorities to find tech solutions to complex real-life problems, companies like Huawei are rushing to sell their vision of smart cities and reshape our public spaces. A lack of transparency often pervades these public-private partnerships – the fact that some European cities are failing to their obligation to answer information requests or making the access to information processes difficult to access should be alarming to citizens. We should know about and have a say in the deployment of such intrusive systems in our everyday lives. This obscuring of information vital to the public interest, combined with the lack of public debate in the procurement and installation of these technologies, sets a concerning precedent for future technologies.
- The mapping we have conducted above shows that in the absence of meaningful transparency and regulation, Huawei and companies offering similar products will keep selling public authorities technologies, like facial recognition, that are putting our fundamental rights at risk.
- The answer to this threat to our public space will be more scrutiny and stronger regulations.. In addition, we advocate in Europe for a common regulation on biometric mass surveillance and facial recognition. This is why Privacy International has joined over 40 organisations to demand a ban on biometric mass surveillance.
- If you are a European Union citizen, join us and sign the petition.
- 
- PI joined 75+ organisations to call on EU policy makers to rework the draft EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive so it is able to address human rights abuses in the tech sector. PI had previously made submissions to the consultation on the draft Directive proposal by the European Commission.
- Privacy International files complaints with two regulators against the UK Home Office's use of GPS ankle tags to monitor migrants, a seismic change in surveillance of individuals in the UK.
- New briefing details the growth of the private intelligence industry in the UK and what needs to be done about it.
- Privacy International submitted its input to the forthcoming report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (HCHR) on the practical application of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) to the activities of technology companies, to be presented at the 50th session of the Human Rights Council in June 2022.
- Our submissions address the systemic lack of transparency and accountability of the technology industry, in particular in its relationships with governments and authorities. We recommend concrete measures to ensure human rights standards are applied and upheld in the activities of technology companies, and when their products and services are used by governments for surveillance and public decision-making.
