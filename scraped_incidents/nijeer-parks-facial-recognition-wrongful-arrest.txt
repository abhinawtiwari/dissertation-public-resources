- In December 2020, 33-year-old Black man Nijeer Parks annnounced he would sue (pdf) New Jersey city, police department, and prosecutor for false arrest, false imprisonment and violation of his civil rights for misidentifying him using facial recognition.
- Parks had been arrested in January 2019 for purportedly shoplifting from a candy shop in Woodbridge, New Jersey. The real cuplrit had given the police a fake driver's license with Park's photograph before absconding, leading to the police issuing a warrant for Parks' arrest. Only Parks had never been to Woodbridge, had never owned a driver's license, and had a sound alibi.
- Having feigned an asthma attack during a police interrogation, Parks was arrested, denied bail, and held for 10 days. Parks was finally released and the case against him dismissed for lack of evidence.

- Nijeer Parks, 33, is suing Woodbridge Township for false imprisonment
- A New Jersey man has filed a civil suit accusing police of falsely arrested him based solely on facial recognition software that was later banned in the state.
- Nijeer Parks, 33, was held in jail for 10 days, falsely charged in a 2019 shoplifting incident in Woodbridge that ended with the thief ramming a parked police car as he escaped.
- Now, Parks' attorney Daniel Sexton has filed a lawsuit against city and police officials in Woodbridge, alleging that they violated his client's rights by relying on dubious facial recognition software.
- 'I had no idea what this was about. I'd never been to Woodbridge before, didn't even know for sure where it was,' Parks recalled to NJ.com, adding that he didn't even have a car or driver's license at the time of the crime.
- Police were seeking a thief who shoplifted candy at this Hampton Inn and then rammed a patrol car as he fled the scene in a Dodge Challenger. Facial recognition was the only link to Parks, who insisted that he had never been in the area and doesn't even drive
- 'The mistaken identity was solely based on facial recognition software that is illegal in the state now and was always known to be faulty,' Sexton told the outlet.
- The suit alleges that the wrongful arrest was motivated by 'anti-black animus' and that Parks 'was detained, arrested and charged primarily because he is or appears racially African-American.'
- Parks had previously served six years behind bars on two convictions for selling drugs, but says that he was committed to setting his life straight after his release in 2016, according to NJ.com.
- He was working as a clerk in a Price Rite supermarket and saving up to marry his fiance when, in January 2019, he was surprised to discover that cops wanted him for a brazen crime spree at a hotel in Woodbridge.
- In that incident, police were called to the Hampton Inn on January 26, 2019 in response to a shoplifter stealing candy and other snacks from the hotel gift shop.
- The thief darted into the hotel bathroom when a clerk called police, and when officers arrived, he handed over a Tennessee driver's license identifying him as 25-year-old Jamal Owens.
- The thief at the Hampton Inn provided this driver's license to police before fleeing. Cops believe it is fraudulent after running a check on the name
- Facial recognition software identified Parks (above in a booking photo) as a match to the photo in the suspected phony driver's license. Parks says he had nothing to do with the incident
- Police ran a check on the license revealing the license was invalid and possibly fraudulent, but when they moved to arrest the man he fled out the back door, losing a sneaker.
- The man then jumped into a black Dodge Challenger, ignoring orders to halt, and gunned the engine, forcing an officer to jump out of the way as he peeled out.
- The Challenger crashed into the back of a patrol car before speeding away, and was later found abandoned in a parking lot.
- Police still had the suspected phony driver's license, and the day after the hotel crime spree investigators in New York and New Jersey told Woodbridge cops that they had a 'high profile' match through facial recognition software.
- The software from Clearview AI was banned for use in law enforcement earlier this year by New York Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, pending a review of the technology and policies surrounding its use.
- The software identified Parks, who had photos in the system through his drug arrests, and warrants were issued for his arrest on charges including shoplifting, false government documents, and resisting arrest. Charges of aggravated assault with a weapon, weapons offenses, and leaving the scene of a crash were later added against him.
- The software from Clearview AI was banned for use in law enforcement earlier this year by New York Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, pending a review of the technology
- Police checked several addresses in an attempt to serve the warrants, and Parks heard from his grandmother on January 30 that police in Woodbridge were seeking him for the hotel incident.
- Parks got a cousin to drive him to the Woodbridge police department, expecting to quickly clear up the allegations as a case of mistaken identity.
- Instead, the suit alleges, he was held in an interview room and grilled by cops who told him 'you know what you did' as they showed him photos of the damaged Dodge Challenger.
- When Parks requested an attorney, he says the police handcuffed him to a bench in a hallway for about an hour, before leading him into a second room. Fearing for his safety, he faked an asthma attack and was taken to the ER before being booked into jail.
- He spent 10 days behind bars before making bail. He decided to fight the charges, emptying his savings account to hire a lawyer, and turning down a plea deal for six years in prison. At trial, he faced up to 20 years behind bars.
- In pretrial hearings, a skeptical judge demanded more evidence from prosecutors beyond the facial recognition match. Prosecutors later dropped the charges against Parks.
- Parks' suit claims civil rights violations, excessive force, false imprisonment and cruel and unusual punishment. It seeks unspecified damages for physical and emotional pain and suffering.

- A New Jersey man sued police and prosecutors, claiming he was wrongly arrested and jailed after facial recognition software mistakenly linked him to a hotel theft.
- Nijeer Parks, 33, a Black man from Paterson, said his grandmother told him on Jan. 30, 2019, that an arrest warrant had been issued for him, according to the civil lawsuit filed in Passaic County.
- He was accused of shoplifting from a Hampton Inn gift store in Woodbridge and then clipping a police car as he sped off. But Parks said in early 2019 that he didn't own a car and that at the time had never possessed a driver's license.
- Parks said he went to Woodbridge police headquarters on Feb. 5 to clear up the mistake and was arrested.
- "As he had previously told the clerk, plaintiff told the interrogators that [he] had never had a driver's license, that he had never owned a car, and that he had never even been in Woodbridge," according to the lawsuit by Parks' attorney, Daniel Sexton.
- "Plaintiff also gave ... a solid alibi that proved he could not have done what he was suspected of doing," the suit says.
- Parks claimed that as he sat in jail for 10 days, police and prosecutors didn't bother to check fingerprints and DNA at the scene that could have cleared him.
- "Defendant police department was relying solely on the faulty and illegal [facial recognition software] or some analogous program while all evidence and forensics confirmed plaintiff had no relationship to the suspect for the crimes," according to Sexton.
- Sexton said all charges were dropped.
- County prosecutors and jailers, Woodbridge police and the mayor are named as respondents.
- A Woodbridge spokesman declined to comment Tuesday, claiming that no one from the township had been served with the lawsuit yet. Representatives for prosecutors and jailers didn't immediately return messages seeking their response.
- While use of facial recognition technology is growing, critics say algorithms struggle to distinguish faces of people with dark skin.
- Nathan Freed Wessler, a staff lawyer for the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said Tuesday that Parks' arrest was the result of "flawed and privacy-invading surveillance technology."
- "There are likely many more wrongful interrogations, arrests, and possibly even convictions because of this technology that we still do not know about," Wessler said in a statement, adding that "this technology disproportionately harms the Black community."
- CORRECTION (Dec. 29, 2020, 10:50 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article and an accompanying photo caption misspelled Nijeer Parks' hometown. It is Paterson, New Jersey, not Patterson.

- A Black man is suing a New Jersey police department after he says he spent 10 days in jail after being misidentified by facial-recognition technology.
- In early 2019, the police were called to a shoplifting incident at a Hampton Inn hotel in Woodbridge, New Jersey. The suspect fled the scene, however, clipping a police car with his vehicle on his way.
- Weeks later, a man named Nijeer Parks learned the police had issued a warrant for his arrest. Parks, who doesn't have a driver's license, told NJ Advance Media that he asked his cousin to drive him to the police station to clear his name.
- "I had no idea what this was about," he said. "I'd never been to Woodbridge before, didn't even know for sure where it was." Upon arriving at the station, however, Parks said, he was handcuffed and spent 10 days in jail.
- According to NJ Advance Media, Parks fought the charges and ultimately got them dismissed. Parks' attorney says the police and prosecutors pursued his client based only on evidence provided through facial-recognition technology.
- "I did have a background, but I'd been home since 2016 and I had been in no trouble," Parks told NJ Advance Media. "The whole thing scared the heck out of me. I've been trying to do the right thing with my life."
- The incident wouldn't be the only case of mistaken identity via facial-recognition technology, which experts have said has a racial bias and can be less accurate with nonwhite skin tones.
- Earlier this year, Robert Julian-Borchak Williams was arrested in Detroit, accused of stealing five watches costing $3,800 from a Shinola store in October 2018.
- Unbeknownst to Williams at the time, he had been misidentified by facial-recognition tech called DataWorks Plus, which was used by the Michigan State Police. NJ Advance Media initially suggested that the technology at the center of Parks' case was developed by a company called Clearview AI but later walked it back, saying the source was unclear.
- In Parks' lawsuit, his attorney reportedly accused the police of excessive force, false imprisonment, and cruel and unusual punishment and is seeking compensation for physical and emotional suffering.
- In January, about a year after the shoplifting incident at the center of Parks' case, New Jersey's attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, said the city had ordered the police to stop using facial-recognition technology.

- A New Jersey man is suing the town of Woodbridge and its police department after he was falsely arrested following an incorrect facial recognition match. Nijeer Parks spent 10 days in jail last year, including a week in "functional solitary confinement," following a shoplifting incident that January.
- After officers were called to a Hampton Inn in Woodbridge, the alleged shoplifter presented them with a Tennessee driver's license, which they determined was fake. When they attempted to arrest him after spotting what appeared to be a bag of marijuana in his pocket, the man fled in his rental car. One officer said he had to leap out of the way or he would have been hit.
- State agencies with access to facial recognition systems analyzed the photo from the license and they found an apparent match in Parks’ state ID. Parks, who testified that he had never even driven a car or been to Woodbridge, was able to prove that he was sending money at a pharmacy over 30 miles away at the time of the incident. His case was dismissed in November last year after he spent over $5,000 defending himself.
- Parks has been convicted twice on drugs charges and could have faced a lengthy sentence for a third felony. He's suing for false arrest, false imprisonment and violation of his civil rights.
- It's the third known case of a false facial recognition match leading to a wrongful arrest in the US. The three people at the heart of those cases are all Black men. The two other incidents both occurred in the Detroit area, indicating this is not a localized issue. One of those men, Michael Oliver, has sued the city of Detroit and the detective in his case.
- “Multiple people have now come forward about being wrongfully arrested because of this flawed and privacy-invading surveillance technology," Nathan Freed Wessler, senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberty Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, told Engadget in a statement. "There are likely many more wrongful interrogations, arrests, and possibly even convictions because of this technology that we still do not know about. Unsurprisingly, all three false arrests that we know about have been of Black men, further demonstrating how this technology disproportionately harms the Black community. Law enforcement use of face recognition technology must be stopped immediately.”
- It's unclear which facial recognition system was used to falsely identify Parks as the perpetrator. Clearview AI founder Hoan Ton-That told the New York Times that agencies involved in analyzing the photo weren't using his company's controversial software at the time.
- In January, New Jersey attorney general Gurbir Grewal ordered police in the state to stop using Clearview AI's app. Other jurisdictions have banned police use of Clearview AI's software or facial recognition in general.

- A New Jersey man is suing the the town of Woodbridge and its police department, alleging he was falsely arrested and jailed after since-banned facial recognition technology falsely identified him as the perpetrator of a shoplifting. Nijeer Parks says police arrested him in 2019 for an incident in January of that year, where the perpetrator hit a police car before driving off. This was a surprise to Parks, who does not drive nor have a driver's license. While Parks's defense lawyer originally said that Clearview AI was used in his arrest, he later retracted that claim.

- New Jersey police are under fire after wrongfully accusing and arresting a suspect based on nothing more than faulty facial recognition software that's since been banned in the state. Now, he's suing.
- Nijeer Parks was surprised to learn in January 2019 that police in the town of Woodbridge had a warrant out for his arrest for a list of crimes including shoplifting and aggravated assault. Parks told NJ Advance Media he had never even been to that town, but when he went to the police station, cops arrested him immediately.
- He later learned that police had identified him using Clearview AI's controversial facial recognition software — revealing how over-reliance on flawed policing algorithms can effectively accuse innocent people of crimes.
- Because there are so many issues with the software's accuracy and the way it obtains images from social media, NJ Advance Media reported that New Jersey State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal ordered cops to stop using the tech on January 24 2020 — almost a full year after Parks was arrested.
- With just the facial recognition match as proof, police interrogated Parks in camera-free rooms, held him in jail for ten days, and set off a year-long legal battle that drained Parks' savings until a judge finally told prosecutors not to return unless they had real, tangible evidence against him, according to NJ Advance.
- Parks has now filed a civil rights lawsuit against Woodbridge's police director and mayor as well as Middlesex County's Prosecutor's Office and county jail.
- "The mistaken identity was solely based on facial recognition software that is illegal in the state now and was always known to be faulty," his attorney Daniel Sexton told NJ Advance Media. "No actual evidence supported the charges against my client. No fingerprints or DNA, no blood type."
- While the technology has been banned in New Jersey — hopefully preventing more of these horror stories from happening — the whole ordeal reveals what happens when faulty algorithms are left to shape people's lives without oversight.

- Nijeer Parks was bewildered when he was arrested and taken into custody in February 2019. Apparently, he’d been accused of shoplifting and attempting to hit a police officer with a car at a Hampton Inn, as the New York Times reported. But Woodbridge, New Jersey, where the crime had taken place, was 30 miles from his home, and Parks had neither a car nor a driver’s license at the time, according to NBC News. Court documents indicated that he had no idea how he’d been implicated in a crime he knew he didn’t commit — until he discovered that the case against him was based solely on a flawed facial-recognition match. According to a December report by the Times, this was the third-known instance of a wrongful arrest caused by facial recognition in the U.S. All three of those victims were Black men.
- Algorithms failed Parks twice: First, he was mistakenly identified as the suspect; then, he was robbed of due process and jailed for 10 days at the recommendation of a risk assessment tool used to assist pretrial release decisions. These tools have been adopted by courts across the country despite evidence of racial bias and a 2018 letter signed by groups like the ACLU and NAACP cautioning against their use. At one point, Parks told the Times, he even considered pleading guilty. The case was ultimately dropped, but he’s now suing the Woodbridge Police Department, the city of Woodbridge, and the prosecutors involved in his wrongful arrest.
- These are the costs of algorithmic injustice. We’re approaching a new reality, one in which machines are weaponized to undermine liberty and automate oppression with a pseudoscientific rubber stamp; in which opaque technology has the power to surveil, detain, and sentence, but no one seems to be held accountable for its miscalculations.

- U.S. law enforcement agencies have embraced facial recognition as an investigative aid in spite of a 2018 study from MIT that discovered software error rates ranging from 0.8% for light-skinned men to 34.7% for dark-skinned women. In majority-Black Detroit, the police chief approximated a 96% error rate in his department’s software last year (though the company behind the software told Vice they don’t keep statistics on the accuracy of its real-world use), but he still refuses a ban.
- Artificial intelligence (AI) works by supplying a computer program with historical data so it can deduce patterns and extrapolate from those patterns to make predictions independently. But this often creates a feedback loop of discrimination. For example, so-called predictive policing tools are purported to identify future crime hot spots and optimize law enforcement resource allocation, but because training data can reflect racially disparate levels of police presence, they may merely flag Black neighborhoods irrespective of a true crime rate. This is exactly what Minority Report warned us about.
- Princeton University sociologist Ruha Benjamin has sounded the alarm about a “new Jim Code,” a reference to the Jim Crow laws that once enforced segregation in the U.S. Others have alluded to a tech-to-prison pipeline, making it crystal clear that mass incarceration isn’t going away — it’s just being warped by a sophisticated, high-tech touch.
- That’s not to say that AI can’t be a force for good. It has revolutionized disease diagnosis, helped forecast natural disasters, and uncovered fake news. But the misconception that algorithms are some sort of infallible silver bullet for all our problems — “technochauvinism,” as data journalist Meredith Broussard put it in her 2018 book — has brought us to a place where AI is making high-stakes decisions that are better left to humans. And in the words of Silicon Valley congressman Ro Khanna (D-CA), the technological illiteracy of “most members of Congress” is “embarrassing,” precluding effective governance.
- That must change; racial, economic, and social justice require algorithmic justice. My peers and I are leading the charge to ensure that AI leaves no one behind. Last July, I learned about California Proposition 25, which would have mandated the use of pretrial risk assessment algorithms. I leapt into action and launched a campaign to harness the power of youth in opposition to the measure. We organized aggressively, hosting phone banks and town halls in partnership with community groups and the formerly incarcerated. We offered the sole voice of high school students on the issue. California voters eventually rejected Prop 25 by a 13% margin, aligning themselves against corporate interests, the political establishment, and analysts’ expectations.
- With that victory under our belt, we became Encode Justice, an international, youth-powered organization fighting for ethical AI. Our team spans 23 U.S. states and 11 countries. We’re crafting policy proposals, building legislative momentum, teaching AI ethics workshops, and expanding our Medium publication. We’ve lobbied city councils to ban facial recognition and are now establishing a collaborative committee across student-led organizations. At the heart of our work is a commitment to uniting high school technologists, activists, and creatives in what could be a defining battle of our time. You can join us by telling your member of Congress that you support a moratorium on face surveillance, applying for our fellowship program, starting a regional chapter, or signing up to contribute an article.
- Without intervention, the promise of AI may be quickly eclipsed by its perils. This isn’t an abstract technical phenomenon; it’s a 21st-century civil rights issue. Our generation is the most progressive yet, and we’ve only ever known a world shaped by the internet. If we’re not on the front lines of regulating technology, we risk being complicit in turning isolated incidents into institutional trends. We risk jeopardizing the freedom of more people like Nijeer Parks. We must refuse to remain silent — we must encode justice.
