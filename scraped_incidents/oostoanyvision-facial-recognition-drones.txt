- Drones equipped with facial recognition are coming, whether the world is ready for them or not. (Photo by Sunil Ghosh/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)
- Some of the first drones with advanced facial recognition capabilities are being developed by Israeli surveillance companies, as American police consider whether they will soon be adding the controversial technology to their unmanned flying machines.
- As a sign of the imminent arrival of biometric identification from the air, an Israeli startup, one previously-funded by Microsoft, has patented technologies for drone-based facial recognition. A patent application, published earlier this month, was filed by Tel Aviv-based AnyVision back in August 2019 in the U.S., detailing tech to help a drone find the best angles for a facial recognition shot, before trying to find a match for the target by referring to faces stored in a database. It was titled, “Adaptive positioning of drones for enhanced facial recognition,” and filed by current and former AnyVision employees, including three from Belfast, U.K.
- The patent aims to iron out some of the complexities of identifying faces from a flying machine. Various obvious issues arise when trying to recognize someone from a drone: acquiring an angle at which a face can be properly captured and being able to get good-quality visuals whilst moving or hovering. Both are considerably harder than getting a match from static footage.
- The AnyVision patent details how facial recognition from a drone would work.
- U.S. military agencies have been trying to come up with solutions, including the Advanced Tactical Facial Recognition at a Distance Technology project at U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Biometric Recognition and Identification at Altitude and Range initiative.
- But private industry may get there first. This December, it was revealed AnyVision executives had partnered with Israeli defense supplier Rafael for a new joint venture called SightX. In demos provided to Israeli media in late 2020, SightX’s small drones didn’t have any facial recognition capabilities, though executives said that feature was coming soon. It’s unclear if the tech is for the military only or if it will be sold to police agencies. Neither SightX nor Rafael responded to requests for comment.
- What is clear is that the technology is ready for launch. AnyVision CEO Avi Golan told Forbes that whilst AnyVision didn’t have any in-production drones with facial recognition, they would be a reality soon. “I'm actually very glad to have a patent on that,” he said, suggesting it would work well in smart cities, where drones could provide functions beyond surveillance. He pointed to delivery drones as potentially requiring facial recognition to determine whether they’ve reached the correct buyer. Amazon has already patented similar tech, pointing to its potential plans for its experimental drone delivery fleet.
- But, Golan added, though the tech exists, AnyVision is waiting on wider acceptance of both drones and facial recognition before any product is released. “I think it's more futuristic technology, but I want to have it in the back of my pocket once it’s more accepted by humanity.” He noted that the company doesn’t currently work with U.S. law enforcement, instead choosing to work with private companies like casinos and retailers.
- AnyVision has already had to fend off questions over the use of its technology. Microsoft bought a stake in the startup during a $74 million round in 2019, but last year pulled out after reports that AnyVision’s tool had been used at Israel-West Bank border crossings. Golan said Microsoft’s main reason for exiting was its inability to exert control over AnyVision. Microsoft said much the same after an audit led by former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder found it was used at the border, but discounted claims that AnyVision software had been used to surveil Palestinians across the West Bank.
- As for when Americans can expect police drones with facial recognition, even if police agencies aren’t immediately planning to send them to the skies, there’s an expectation they will arrive in one form or another. “I think at some point in the future, we will likely see that,” said Mike Hutchins, lieutenant and drones lead at Sacramento Police Department. “We're trying to balance technology with people's right to privacy. And obviously, if you walk into a grocery store, into a retail store, into a bank, they're capturing your face as you walk in. Pretty much anywhere you go in public now your face is being captured by cameras that are clearly capable of running facial recognition software. But we don't have any plans at all to merge those two anytime in the future. Not to say that at some point, it may not happen.”

- Israeli computer vision company AnyVision has recently filed a patent that will allow drones to locate and identify people easily from the air. The patent covers how the technology will allow the drone to adjust its position to see faces clearly.
- Earlier in the month, a patent was filed by AnyVision employees to the US patent office with the title of “Adaptive positioning of drones for enhanced facial recognition.” The name says it all.
- The patent essentially allows the drones to adjust their location in the sky to find the best angle for detecting and recognizing faces. This would allow the police and countries to locate criminals and track everyone in a location from the air.
- Currently, drones and facial recognition require humans to pilot the drone and often control the camera as well, requiring more time to get the job done and the possibility of missing someone as the camera is zoomed in so much.
- This patent will allow this process to be fully automated. An agency would send a drone out to a specific location they think someone is at. The drone will then begin detecting faces, moving up, down, and side to side to find the best angle. The faces picked up by the drone are then matched to a database, giving police the go-ahead if their target is located.
- Reading this, you likely think about the privacy concerns this will bring along with it. The current issue with drones being used by police and other agencies is privacy. Basically, with a drone, everything you do can be watched and recorded without your knowledge by a drone.
- AnyVision’s CEO Avi Golen shared:
- I think it’s more futuristic technology, but I want to have it in the back of my pocket once it’s more accepted by humanity.
- AnyVision has already faced this technology after it was accused of misusing a similar facial recognition technology. Microsoft invested $74 million, then backed out of supporting the company after rumors spread that its technology was used at the Israel-West Bank border.

- A constant in works of dystopia and science fiction is that of an oppressive future in which drones will be able to identify citizens in search and seizure.
- And that fictional idea is one step closer to becoming a reality, according to a patent from AnyVision, an Israeli company based in Tel Aviv.
- Amazon is installing artificially intelligent cameras to monitor its delivery drivers "100% of the time."
- As detailed by Forbes AnyVision has filed a patent that will help unmanned flying devices get the best angle to obtain high-quality, full-face images of citizens who need to be identified. Although it is not the definitive integration of facial recognition in this type of device, it is an important step in the same direction.
- The CEO of AnyVision, the firm at the center of this story, has cautioned that AnyVision is not yet producing any drones with integrated facial recognition capabilities. Avi Golan, however, has explained in Forbes that he is very happy to already have a patent in that regard.
- AnyVision is an Israeli startup that was backed by Microsoft in its early days. However, the Seattle-based multinational stopped working with it after the controversy over the use of its facial recognition cameras in the Gaza Strip. It is also the Israeli company that hired Mercadona to install facial recognition cameras. The Spanish Data Protection Agency has until next July to rule on this installation.
- Mercadona's facial recognition is "difficult to justify", according to the European Data Protection Supervisor.
- While this patent paves the way for technological development to integrate facial recognition solutions in surveillance drones, law enforcement agencies around the world continue to debate whether or not it is appropriate to have these tools, according to Forbes. Although research has been conducted in the public sector - with advanced work being done by US military units, for example - it seems that the private sector has taken the lead.
- In fact, AnyVision itself partnered with another defense firm also based in Israel, called Rafael, for a joint venture called SightX. Demonstrations of SightX's technology consisted of small surveillance drones that at the moment did not have the capability to use facial recognition, a utility that would be installed later.
- Although the technology exists, Golan, CEO of AnyVision, hopes that the use of this technology will become more accepted by society. "I think it's a futuristic technology, but I want to have it in my pocket until it becomes more accepted by humanity." At the moment the firm is not working with U.S. law enforcement, he recalls.

- Drones with advanced facial recognition capabilities, a common feature in works of science fiction, recently took a big step closer to becoming a reality.
- Earlier this month a US patent was filed by an Israeli private surveillance company that would help drones accurately identify people on the ground. The patent details technology to guide a drone in finding the best angles for a facial recognition shot, before trying to find a match for the target by referring to faces stored in a database.
- It was titled, ‘Adaptive positioning of drones for enhanced facial recognition,’ and filed by current and former AnyVision employees, including three from Belfast.
- In and of themselves, neither drones nor facial recognition technology are new. Drones capable of recording high quality video have been commercially available for years now, and larger devices have been employed by militaries for nearly two decades. Likewise, if you own a modern smartphone the chances are you use facial recognition multiple times per day.
- But drones capable of facial recognition have proved significantly challenging. The issue is that facial recognition is only accurate when the camera conducting it benefits from low positioning, clear lighting and an unobstructed view. Even fixed-position cameras that do not benefit from these elements struggle with accuracy, as evidenced by a 2019 study of the London Metropolitan Police’s facial recognition technology which revealed the system to have a shocking 81 per cent real world error rate.
- US military agencies have been trying to come up with a solution, but it now seems likely that private industry will get there first. AnyVision’s patent paves the way for the integration of facial recognition solutions in surveillance drones, although it remains to be seen whether law enforcement agencies around the world will deem it appropriate to have these tools.
- Benjamin Foux, a London-based information technology lawyer told the Cyprus Mail that the coming years will see a tussle between technological advancements in the security field and people’s right to privacy. “The patent seems to have caused some backlash, but pretty much anywhere you go in public your face is being captured by cameras capable of running face ID software. It’s a matter of time.’
- AnyVision’s CEO, Avi Golen told Forbes that whilst AnyVision didn’t have any in-production drones with facial recognition, they would be a reality soon. He added that a wider acceptance of such technologies would be crucial to their deployment. “I think it’s more futuristic technology, but I want to have it in the back of my pocket once it’s more accepted by humanity.”
- AnyVision have already had to defend themselves over misuse of similar technology. Microsoft, having purchased a stake in a $74m funding round in 2019, exited their position last year following allegations that AnyVision’s technology had been used at an Israel-West bank border crossing.
- While Cyprus police did not respond to a request for comment about whether they would consider using such technology, they have already taken to patrolling the streets from the skies with surveillance drones over the course of the pandemic.

- 
- A patent application filed by AnyVision for a system to adjust the flying position of drones to capture images for face biometric comparisons has been published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
- The patent for ‘Adaptive positioning of drones for enhanced face recognition’ describes a drone recognizing a potential target and adjusting its position to increase the probability score for a match. The system could involve multiple different attempts to find an angle that aligns more with the target’s head pose or avoids an object occluding the target’s face in the image. Acquiring a good quality image while moving or hovering is also addressed.
- The one application described in the patent filing, beyond identifying or authenticating an individual, is package delivery.
- The biometric technology could also be useful in smart cities, and provide functions besides surveillance, AnyVision CEO Avi Golan told Forbes, though he does not expect it to be widely deployed any time soon.
- “I think it’s more futuristic technology, but I want to have it in the back of my pocket once it’s more accepted by humanity,” Golan says.
- A joint venture between AnyVision shareholders and Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems dubbed SightX recently demonstrated biometric drones developed for military use.
- Research projects by the U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) include the biometric detection of people from a distance, and that project includes both facial recognition and ‘whole-body’ recognition.
- Sacramento Police Department Lieutenant and Drones Lead Mike Hutchins tells Forbes police drones with facial recognition suggested the technology will likely be available to police at some point in the future, but a balance with privacy rights must be struck, and the department has no plans to pursue such an application at this time.
- Meanwhile in the UK, police used drones to monitor political protests, including Black Lives Matter marches, according to documents received by UK Drone Watch.
- Protests monitored by drones also included a rally by far-right groups in Nottingham, an animal rights demonstration, Extinction Rebellion protests and HS2 marches.
- Between January and October of 2020, police used drones to monitor more than three dozen protests in ten different jurisdictions around Britain. Police policies on the use of the technology, and images gathered by it, are mostly not publicly available, and appear to be inconsistent, according to the report.
- NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the organization needs to embrace advanced capabilities and technologies, and to develop common standards around them, including for ethics, Defense News reports.
- Stoltenberg was speaking at a virtual press conference, and referred explicitly to both drones and facial recognition, but in different contexts. He mentioned drones as part of the alliance’s need  for communication technologies, and face biometrics along with AI, quantum computing, and autonomous systems as disruptive technologies of strategic importance.
- The Secretary-General is pushing for an initiative to preserve what he says is NATO’s “technological edge” under the forthcoming ‘NATO 2030’ project.
- This post was updated at 5:57pm Eastern on February 16, 2021 to clarify that AnyVision shareholders are partners in SightX, rather than the company itself.
