- In June 2021, footage of a girl dancing spliced with a highly graphic and disturbing video of a man being beheaded by a group of men in a bathroom went viral on TikTok.
- Per Newsweek, the video had previously been present on gore sites for two years, with reports at the time of its initial discovery in 2019 alleging the victim was a 19-year-old Mexican man.
- Digital and human rights advocates argued the incident demonstrated the limitations of the company's content moderation system, which proved unable to detect and block the video before it spread across its platform.
- TikTok said they 'quickly' removed the offending item. But this didn't stop TikTok users saying they were too scared to use the app lest they saw the beheading.

- An extremely graphic video that recently went viral on social media app TikTok includes footage of a young man getting decapitated in a bloody bathroom.
- The video was shared by user @mayenggo3 - who has since been banned - and  starts with a girl dancing in front of a camera in a black tank top and white shorts.
- Seconds later, it cuts to the gory scene where several men, speaking Spanish, saw off a living man's head.
- The clip has sparked outrage and demands for TikTok - the social media site most popular with young teens and kids - to tighten up its security.
- Graphic footage of a beheading has gone viral on TikTok by posing as the dance video depicted above.
- A spokesperson for TikTok apologized for the security breach in a statement to Newsweek about the incident.
- 'We appreciate the concerted effort by our community to warn about an unconscionably graphic clip from another site that was spliced into a video and brought onto TikTok,’ the spokesperson said.
- ‘The original video was quickly removed, and our systems are proactively detecting and blocking attempted re-uploads of the clip to catch malicious behavior before the content can receive views. We apologize to those in our community, including our moderators, who may have come upon this content.’
- According to a Newsweek article, the video has since been added to TikTok's "Hashbank" system, which now automatically detects it before it's posted.
- A TikTok content moderator spoke to Newsweek about the incident and said that whoever posted the video most likely breached the app's AI security system by editing the original dance video to include the graphic scene.
- The app's AI server automatically scans videos for graphic content. But users could deceive the AI by reformatting their videos multiple times and adding the graphic content in later.
- 'Only when a video reaches 500 views is it then sent to be moderated by a human,' according to the Newsweek story, which explains that the graphic scene was taken from a video that has been shared in various Internet spaces since 2019 and allegedly features a 19-year-old boy in Mexico.
- The account that shared the beheading video has been taken down and a spokesperson for TikTok apologized for the breach in security.
- 
- According to TikTok’s community guidelines, the app does not permit ‘content that is gratuitously shocking, graphic, sadistic, or gruesome or that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies extreme violence or suffering on our platform.’
- ‘When there is a threat to public safety, we suspend or ban the account and, when warranted, we will report it to relevant legal authorities,’ reads the community guidelines. It is unclear whether TikTok contacted law enforcement to investigate the video and find out its origin.
- The account that shared the video has since been taken down and the identities of the girl, victim and other men in the video have not been verified.
- Heavy sought answers by having the video translated by fluent Spanish speaker Juan D. Sanchez. Although some speculated that the victim was the same girl in the video's introduction, Sanchez said that the victim must be a man because the assailants refer to him as 'puto,' or a masculine form of the Spanish slur meaning 'a**hole'.
- Another social media theory was that the video was a depiction of a cartel killing, but the men in the video don't refer to a cartel. Instead, according to Heavy, they say, 'This is what’s going to happen to all sons of b*****s, s**t. Just like this whore, Pillo.”
- Pillo is a male nickname for Guadalupe, Lupe or Lupillo. Sanchez added that their accent and intonations indicate that they may be from the Guanajuato or Jalisco area.
- In the days following the video's share on TikTok, many shared their shock and horror on accidentally viewing it. Twitter user lexi28 wrote, 'why is the video of the girl getting her head chopped off going around again? please be careful on tiktok.'
- Another user, named k, wrote, 'if ur on tiktok, PLEASE be careful!! someone uploaded a video of a beheading, the original got taken down but other accounts are re-uploading it. it starts with a video of a girl dancing to d!ck by starboi3 and doja cat then it cuts to the graphic video.'
- And a user named Faye shared that she was duped by the video and warned others against viewing it. 'Found out the hard way there is a video going around tiktok that shows an actual human decapitation. If you see a young woman with long dark hair, black tank top, and white shorts dancing to Doja Cat, IMMEDIATELY swipe away. If you see any videos of anyone talking about it, pause.'
- This isn't the first time that graphic videos depicting death went viral on the app. In October 2019, the Daily Mail reported that a number of accounts linked to ISIS were removed after posting clips depicting beheadings and torture. And in September 2020, TikTok made headlines after a man's suicide video went viral on the app. The video used the same technique to surpass TikTok's security by splicing the video with unrelated content.

- TikTok said that it has removed a violent, graphic video from the platform that depicted a beheading and prompted users to post videos warning each other of its presence on the app's For You Page. According to TikTok, the video is no longer circulating on the platform.
- Newsweek reported that the since-removed video began with footage of a girl dancing before cutting to the graphic clip, which reportedly showed a person being beheaded by a group of men in a bathroom. The graphic video was previously uploaded on another website before it was posted on TikTok, a TikTok representative said.
- Insider was unable to independently identify the origin of the video. French news site Libération reported that it first surfaced online in 2019, with Newsweek reporting that it had previously been hosted on gore websites.
- Social media screenshots, as well as other publications including Libération, appear to show that the video was originally posted by the account @mayengg03, which no longer exists.
- "We appreciate the concerted effort by our community warn about an unconscionably graphic clip from another site that was spliced into a video and brought onto TikTok," a TikTok spokesperson told Insider in a statement.
- "The original video was quickly removed, and our systems are proactively detecting and blocking attempted re-uploads of the clip to catch malicious behavior before the content can receive views. We apologize to those in our community, including our moderators, who may have come upon this content."
- While TikTok says the video is no longer circulating on the platform, the platform is still full of chatter about the graphic video, with users warning each other about it. One audio uploaded by TikTok user @mr.wyeet warns users about the gruesome content and it has been used in nearly 1,500 other videos.
- "[I] can't believe i just watched a girl get her head cut off. people are sick. i'm traumatized," TikTok user @ohheythereitstori wrote in an on-screen caption in a video posted one week ago.
- "[A]fter watching a beheading video on tiktok's front page i don't [sic] think im using that app anymore," Twitter user @MikeCatSU wrote in a tweet.
- Per TikTok's own community guidelines, the platform does not allow "gratuitously shocking, graphic, sadistic, or gruesome" content that "promotes, normalizes, or glorifies extreme violence or suffering on our platform." The guidelines explicitly prohibit content involving humans that shows "violent or graphic deaths or accidents," among other types of violence.
- TikTok has previously worked to remove graphic content from its platform, including one clip that BBC News reported was circulating in September 2020 and showed a man dying by suicide.

- A viral TikTok video showing a girl being beheaded has been removed from the short-form video platform.
- The video of the gory act was created on another platform, although its origin is unclear, and was spliced into a different TikTok so it could be seen and shared by unsuspected users. It appeared to originate from user “Mayenggo3”, whose account appears to be locked. The Independent was unable to contact the user.
- The clip starts with a young girl dancing in front of a camera, before immediately cutting to a different video where the horrific act occurs.
- ‼️HEY EVERYONE‼️ huge warning here in case any of you are on tiktok a lot, there is a video going around that starts with a girl dancing (i believe) & it suddenly cuts to a graphic beheading. PLEASE if you see that video immediately skip past it (heres a picture of the girl) pic.twitter.com/LZJFZuITj3

- “We appreciate the concerted effort by our community to warn about an unconscionably graphic clip from another site that was spliced into a video and brought onto TikTok”, a spokesperson for the company told The Independent.
- “The original video was quickly removed, and our systems are proactively detecting and blocking attempted re-uploads of the clip to catch malicious behaviour before the content can receive views. We apologise to those in our community, including our moderators, who may have come upon this content.”
- The video has been added to TikTok’s machine learning algorithm which will now automatically detect for it before it receives any views, however it is still not known whether the graphic act is legitimate.
- TikTok’s community guidelines state that it does not “not allow content that is gratuitously shocking, graphic, sadistic, or gruesome or that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies extreme violence or suffering on our platform.”
- It is also unclear whether TikTok’s automated moderation policy would take down content that has been sophisticatedly faked. In 2019, Facebook said that its own automatic detection failed to identify the video of the New Zealand mosque shooting because its systems could not distinguish it between first-person perspective video game footage.
- A spokesperson for TikTok told The Independent that the company would investigate the possibility.
- This is not the first time TikTok has been used to spread violent and shocking content. A video of a man taking his own life spreading across the platform in 2020, despite attempts to take it down.
- Many social media companies, including TikTok, are attempting to be both more accurate and faster with regards to content moderation, but there are considerable challenges. As human intervention is too slow to adequately deal with the spread of content, companies often turn to artificial intelligence.
- During the coronavirus pandemic, YouTube relied more on its algorithm to remove content, but even those systems have their failings too.
- In a 2019 report, Ofcom noted that users will try and subvert machine-based moderation, that these systems cannot understand context as well as humans, and they can undermine freedom of expression.

- TikTok is scrambling to take down copies of a graphic suicide video that began circulating Sunday night, going so far as to ban any users who re-upload the clip, The Verge reports. The video, which the company says originated on Facebook, shows a man shooting himself with a gun. “Our systems have been automatically detecting and flagging these clips for violating our policies against content that displays, praises, glorifies, or promotes suicide,” a TikTok spokesperson told The Verge. The video has also been circulated on Twitter and Instagram, but TikTok’s layout may make it more difficult to avoid.
