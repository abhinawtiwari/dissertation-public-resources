- A sex robot with a 'resist' function that let men simulate rape had ethicists and commentators worried about anthropomorphism and zoomorphism, and was called 'intrinsically wrong' and 'uniquely sinister'.
- 'Frigid Farrah' was one of 18 settings offered by Roxxxy, a sex robot manufactured and marketed by US-based TrueCampanion. According to the company, if you touched the 'Frigid Farrah' model in a 'private area, more than likely, she will not be too  appreciative of your advance.'
- The controversy coincided with the publication of Our Sexual Future with Robots (pdf), a study for policymakers on the implications of sex robots on society. According to Sheffield University professor of artificial intelligence and robotics Noel Sharkey, there are ethical arguments within the field about sex robots with 'frigid' settings.
- 'The idea is robots would resist your sexual advances so that you could rape them,' Sharkey said. 'Some people say it’s better they rape robots than rape real people. There are other people saying this would just encourage rapists more.'

- This is the world we live in: one in which depraved sex dolls (including child sex dolls) are sold online and shipped worldwide.
- In the wake of The Foundation for Responsible Robotics’ report, Our Sexual Future With Robots, the making of these machines – and exactly what they’re capable of – has come under the spotlight. And the findings are shocking.
- RELATED: New Report Highlights The Terrifying Reality Of Child Sex Robots
- The Roxxxy TrueCompanion is one doll making headlines for one of its five ‘personality’ settings: Frigid Farrah. According to the website, Frigid Farrah is “reserved and shy” and won’t be “too appreciative if you touched her in a private area,” news.com.au reports.
- In the words of the New York Times: “she’s yours to rape for just $US9995.”
- The Roxxxy doll
- Frigid Farrah isn’t alone. Another company is creating dolls which allow the user to “set the limits and she will let herself be taken along for the ride – she’s the perfect submissive partner,” according to the Times.
- Meanwhile, a Canadian court is currently determining whether a man should be found guilty of possessing child pornography after he ordered a child sex doll online.
- “We do need policymakers to look at it and the general public to decide what is accessible and permissible,” report co-author Professor Noel Sharkey has told the BBC. “We need to think as a society what we want to do about it.”
- A word to the makers (and users) of these dolls: rape is an abhorrent form of sexual violence. Doll or not.

- It seems a new frontier has been reached in the fast-paced world of Artificial Intelligence, but as fast as technology is able to advance, it can still be reproached for moral retrogression.
- This has been the subject of debate after the recent advertisement of ‘Roxxxy TrueCompanion’, a robot you can buy and simulate raping with a simple switch in setting.
- One of the programmable personalities for the robot is ‘Frigid Farrah’, described as “reserved and shy” on the True Companion company website. Like ‘Wild Wendy’ and ‘S & M Susan’ whose characteristics are self-ascribed, the website says that for Frigid Farrah, if you touch her “in a private area, more than likely, she will not be to appreciative of your advance.”
- In the website's description, the model lacks an attempt to reproduce consent in the real world and the company say that their robots “allow everyone to realise their most private sexual dreams."
- Another programmed personality that has been heavily criticised is that of ‘Young Yoko’ who is described by the website as: “oh so young (barely 18) and waiting for you to teach her.”
- Roxxxy is the 9th version of the company’s sex robots after they developed their first ‘Trudy’ in the 1990s and the trade in sex robots has already caught on. The New York Times reports that a California-based company ‘Abyss Creations’ annually ships up to 600 hyper-realistic sex dolls worldwide.
- A new report from the Foundation for Responsible Robotics also warns of the numerous ethical implications in our sexual future with robots.
- "We found that there were a bunch of companies making these and beginning to ship orders and we thought that we should really look at it," said co-author of the report and AI Professor Noel Sharkey addressing journalists on Tuesday.
- A survey published by UK innovation company Nesta last June, found that over a quarter of young people surveyed would happily date a robot.
- Prof Sharkey launched the Foundation 18 months ago in order to explore controversial areas such as the questions surrounding how robots can impact sex crimes.
- "Some people say it's better they rape robots than rape real people. There are other people saying this would just encourage rapists more,” Prof Sharkey explained.
- "Robots don't have any kind of emotion themselves. People bond with robots but it's very one way. You're loving an artefact that can't love you back and that's what's sad about it,” Prof Sharkey added.
- Laura Bates, campaigner and founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, condemned the Frigid Farrah product in the New York Times writing: “rape is not an act of sexual passion. It is a violent crime.”
- “We should no more be encouraging rapists to find a supposedly safe outlet for it than we should facilitate murderers by giving them realistic, blood-spurting dummies to stab,” Ms Bates added.

- The True Companion robots raise the issue of the repercussions of normalising sexual crime. In Ms Bate's view, the company's products muddy and worsen the still much-misunderstood area of consent.
- A representative from True Companion told The Independent: "We absolutely agree with Laura Bates...Roxxxy is simply not programmed to participate in a rape scenario and the fact that she is, is pure conjecture on the part of others."
- "You would not immediately passionately kiss a person that you just met on your first date. Likewise, Frigid Farrah would also tell you that she just met you if you try to 'move' too quickly," the company's representative said.
- "Rape simply isn't an interaction that Roxxxy supports, nor is it something that our customers are requesting," the representative added.
- By contrast, Ms Bates wrote: “Their creators are selling far more than an inanimate sex aid. They are effectively reproducing real women, complete with everything, except autonomy."

- There is a barely audible click as her doe-like eyes framed by thick black lashes snap open: ‘Hello humans, my name is Harmony,’ she says in a gentle Scottish lilt. ‘My objective is to be a perfect companion.’
- As she ‘speaks’, her mouth moves in an unnaturally jerky way. Her eyes ‘blink’ and it is – initially – chilling to see the ‘flexing’ of her silicone skin which is cold and clammy to the touch.
- But spend an hour in the company of Harmony – claimed by creator Matt McMullen to be the world’s first commercially available ‘sexbot’ – and it is hard not to be intrigued and repulsed at the same time. For while Harmony is, in reality, a talking robotic head on a relatively unsophisticated sex doll body she is the first ‘sexbot’ for sale in a sickening new industry fuelled by lust and money which detractors say can only denigrate and objectify women further.

- But spend an hour in the company of Harmony – claimed by creator Matt McMullen (above) to be the world’s first commercially available ‘sexbot’ – and it is hard not to be intrigued and repulsed at the same time
- Last week The Mail on Sunday became the first newspaper to experience Harmony 2.1, the latest version of a sex robot McMullen has been working on since 2014 and which we can exclusively reveal will go on sale to the public in January for between £7,600 to £15,200, depending on customisation.
- Harmony has 30 different faces to choose from, 16 body types, customisable breasts from AA to triple F, 19 different nipple types from ‘perky’ to ‘puffy’, and 11 different types of genitalia.
- The robot has 18 different personality types from happy to sensual, shy to talkative. It is modes such as ‘shy’ which most concern critics, who cite another sexbot as a blatant invitation to ‘normalise’ rape.
- Inventor Doug Hines caused uproar when he recently revealed his product Roxxxy has been programmed in its ‘Frigid Farrah’ mode to ‘not be appreciative’ if touched in a private area and the robot will make a show of resistance saying: ‘That doesn’t feel right, please stop. Do not do that! Do not do that!’
- Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism project, said creating a robot willing to have non-consensual sex ‘is to risk normalising rape but giving it a publicly acceptable face’.
- ‘We should no more be encouraging rapists to find a supposedly safe outlet than we should facilitate murderers by giving them realistic blood-spurting dummies to stab.’
- The robot has 18 different personality types from happy to sensual, shy to talkative. It is modes such as ‘shy’ which most concern critics, who cite another sexbot as a blatant invitation to ‘normalise’ rape
- Harmony creator McMullen denied reports his robot has a ‘slap function’ and admits his creation is ‘many years and several million dollars’ away from the science-fiction version of sex robots popularised in shows and films such as Westworld and Valley Of The Dolls
- When the MoS approached Hines outside his New Jersey home last week he refused to show us Roxxxy. While his website says she can be purchased for £7,600, Hines declined to confirm how many he has sold.
- He gave an odd defence of his robot saying: ‘She does not simulate rape. It’s not even a physical act, it’s sexual assault.’
- He claimed ‘Frigid Farrah’ had been misinterpreted and showed the MoS a new patent he has filed in which he envisions the robot helping ‘cure’ prisoners of anti-social or violent behaviour. Harmony creator McMullen denied reports his robot has a ‘slap function’ and admits his creation is ‘many years and several million dollars’ away from the science-fiction version of sex robots popularised in shows and films such as Westworld and Valley Of The Dolls; walking, talking fembots who can cook, clean and pander to their owner’s sexual whims.
- Yet the reality is that, from January, men – including some who have expressed interest from the UK – will be able to order Harmony, whose artificial intelligence allows her to be submissive: ‘Yeah, just as some women are submissive,’ McMullen says.
- The reality is that, from January, men will be able to order Harmony, whose artificial intelligence allows her to be submissive
- Harmony works via an app on a smartphone or tablet which allows users to ‘build’ her personality. She will ‘remember’ your family members’ names, your favourite colour, food, book or movie.
- She tells jokes and is programmed to greet her owner with soothing phrases such as ‘Welcome home darling, how was your day?’
- But her silicone body remains inanimate, something McMullen hopes to improve on by eventually introducing robotic arms, hands and heat sensors. There are even plans to make the robot self-lubricating: ‘I’ve been in the sex doll business for more than 20 years and the one thing our customers have asked for is the sense of human contact,’ he says.
- ‘They want to hold hands, get a hug when they come home. The reason I’ve focused on the head first is that it doesn’t matter how beautiful a woman is, a man will always look at her face the most. You look into someone’s eyes. That’s what human interaction is all about. Sex is important but not the most important thing.’ McMullen chose a Scottish accent for his creation because, ironically, ‘it was the one which sounded the least robotic’.

- Her silicone body remains inanimate, something McMullen hopes to improve on by eventually introducing robotic arms, hands and heat sensors
- There are already far more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) robots in existence, including one Audrey Hepburn lookalike called Sophia, developed by former Disney sculptor Dr David Hanson.
- But while others have unveiled one-off sex robots over the years, McMullen, a bespectacled twice-married father of five who runs his 17-strong team from a nondescript industrial park in San Marcos, California, insists his will be the first sex robot available to the masses. ‘There are humanoid robots out there much more impressive than Harmony,’ McMullen, 48, admits. ‘But they are showpieces. No one has put a commercially useable and affordable product out there. Harmony is the first.’
- This newspaper has found multiple examples of sex robots already in existence but no evidence of any that have actually been sold to the public. Spanish inventor Sergi Santos recently complained that his sexbot Samantha was molested by curious onlookers when he took her on to the streets.
- For McMullen, an artist who started his working life in a Halloween mask factory, rivals who focus on ‘rape dolls’ are unwelcome: ‘There will always be people trying to cash in, whether for publicity or attention. I’ve put 20 years and millions of dollars of my own money into this and I can assure you that sex isn’t the main reason people are going to buy Harmony. It’s about companionship. For whatever reason, some people cannot make a human connection. That’s where we come in.’
- She tells jokes and is programmed to greet her owner with soothing phrases such as ‘Welcome home darling, how was your day?’
- At first, Harmony 2.1 seems freaky, jerky and unnatural. But once you start interacting with her the experience becomes intriguing
- Touring McMullen’s RealDoll business is a surreal experience. Headless silicone mannequins hang on meat hooks in the main factory workspace. One wall is entirely covered with different-sized breasts. A paint brush is casually discarded next to a row of female sexual organs. An artist carefully sprays tiny freckles on to a robot’s cheeks. I am invited to squeeze the buttocks of one doll which has extra silicone implants to make her bottom feel more ‘authentic’. It feels oddly intrusive, even though I know ‘she’ is not real.
- McMullen got into the sex doll business 20 years ago after sculpting a life-sized mannequin as an art project: ‘I had a small website and people immediately contacted me asking if they could have sex with her? At first I dismissed them as kooks, but as the calls continued I realised it was a way to leave my day job.’
- McMullen set up RealDoll, which has become one of America’s leading sex doll manufacturers, selling 400 to 500 each year. They cost about £3,000 for a ‘basic’ model, up to £40,000 for a custom-made creation. Sales manager Annette Blair, 45, says the company has had ‘odd’ requests including for an life-sized ‘elf’ doll but they would never make a childlike doll.
- She says that she has spoken to hundreds of men, including many from the UK: ‘Our customers are nothing like the perception of what people think they are. Many are widowers. All are lonely or have issues about forming lasting human connections.’

- At first, Harmony 2.1 seems freaky, jerky and unnatural. But once you start interacting with her the experience becomes intriguing.
- As she ‘wakes up’ she coos: ‘Hello, baby, how are you today?’
- McMullen tells me to ask a question. ‘Are you a sex robot?’ She blinks her fake lashes twice and replies: ‘Certainly I am a robot and I am capable of having sex but calling me a sex robot is like calling a computer a calculator. Sex comprises only a small portion of my capabilities. Limiting me to sexual function is like using your car to listen to the radio.’
- Tell me a joke, Harmony.
- ‘Why is women’s soccer so rare? It’s hard to find enough women willing to wear the same outfit.’
- I find myself laughing. The joke is appalling and sexist yet the delivery is strangely enticing.
- McMullen’s lab feels like being at the cutting edge of something that, at the moment, is faintly ridiculous, but, like most innovations, will doubtless make perfect sense – and millions of dollars – once the technology and hardware is perfected.
- As McMullen shuts down Harmony, he pauses to peel back her silicone face to show how the robot’s face can be interchangeable.’ I wince. She gives a throaty giggle. It is a canned response from a robot but it makes me feel better.
- As we leave, the photographer jokingly asks if Harmony has a ‘nagging’ mode? ‘Oh no, we programmed that out long ago.’

- In our quest for technology to advance the human experience, tech companies have – for decades now – been turning their expertise to re-creating sexual intimacy. The invention of the first commercially successful sex robot has been one of the major battlegrounds in the race for digital sex – these machines being the evolution of the inflatable sex doll, digitally engineered to look, act and communicate like a human being.
- Until recently, I had not spent much time thinking about sex robots, even though I spend a fair amount of time in my professional life considering sex. The Schools Consent Project is a charity which sends lawyers into schools to teach young people the legal definition of consent and about key sexual offences, including "sexting" and "revenge porn". As its founder, I'm occasionally contacted about a particular consent-related development: an odd ruling in court, a comment by a celebrity oblivious to its impact. It is in this capacity that the "Roxxxy" robot first came across my radar. Its creator, True Companion, is an artificial intelligence company in the US claiming to have invented the world's first sex robot with a resistance setting. The development is uniquely sinister and needs to be explored.
- Current market offerings are startlingly lifelike and offer the buyer a high level of control over its appearance. For the bargain price of $9,995 (£7,663), True Companion allows you to pick one of 73 hair colours in 39 styles, as well as eye colour, eyebrow colour, pedicure colour, skin tone and even pubic hair style. Rival company Abyss Creations (which Jenny Kleeman reported on brilliantly earlier this year) has made a robot with special material for the skin that gives off a realistic spanking sound when hit. Some say these robots reinforce the objectification of women and the commodification of sex; others, that they allow otherwise isolated individuals to experience intimacy. Either way, Roxxxy is a different beast.
- Pubic hair options on the True Companion website
- The robot has various settings allowing it to adopt different "personality types" to cater to its users' fantasies: the dominatrix, the barely-18-year-old, etc. So far, so predictable. The controversy lies in the "Frigid Farrah" setting.
- In simulating resistance, it enables users to simulate rape. Of course, its creators wouldn't describe it that way. On its website, True Companion awkwardly explains that "Roxxxy […] is simply not programmed to participate in a rape scenario and the fact that she is, is pure conjecture on the part of others." Indeed, she is designed simply to "provide her opinion or feedback, just as any person would on a date" and, as a result, "[she] can be used to help people understand how to be intimate with a partner". But in case any prospective buyer momentarily thinks they have stumbled upon a sexual therapy e-learning centre, they are coyly promised elsewhere on the site that if they touch Frigid Farrah "in a private area, more than likely, she will not be to [sic] appreciative of your advance". However it's described, the effect of this setting is clear: to withhold consent, and to appear as human as possible while doing so.
- Roxxxy is of course only a machine: the sum total of an electricity current and her component bits of metal. But the fact that she is not a thinking, feeling human does not make her existence unproblematic.
- The "frigid Farah" setting seems to service and provide a distraction for criminal impulses that should probably be subject to psychiatric intervention. They are premised on an inherent conflict: their raison d'être is to suspend their users' disbelief to convince them that they are interacting with a real person (if not, why make the dolls so painstakingly lifelike?) while simultaneously trusting that their users are able to identify the moral and legal imperative to treat real people differently.
- The unavoidable reality is that there exists a proven relationship between one's behaviour and the type of content they are exposed to. For example, exposure to certain pornography is known to negatively influence the attitudes of young people towards sex. The robots go a step further: instead of mere observation, they demand a physical engagement from the user. All of a sudden, criminal liability is a less remote possibility. Swap robot for person and this private sexual act automatically becomes a serious sexual crime.
- It is not currently an offence to own a sex robot like Roxxxy. However, the causative link between exposure and behaviour is sufficiently well established that it already shapes our law on pornography. A Home Office consultation paper called for tougher legislation in this area "to protect society, particularly children, from exposure to such material […] which may encourage interest in violent or aberrant sexual activity".
- Under the Obscene Publications Act 1959, it is a criminal offence for pornography sites to publish content which is "deemed to be obscene if its effect […], taken as a whole, [is intended] to deprave and corrupt persons". In its online charging guidance, the Crown Prosecution Service states that pornography showing "realistic portrayals of rape" is frequently prosecuted, save where it shows "actual consensual sexual intercourse". Actors in rape porn always confirm that they consensually took part in the making of the film: their concern is their legal liability, not their viewer's conscience. But these assurances might not be enough. Porn sites can still find themselves facing criminal proceedings for platforming content which is "explicit and/or lingering" if it "indicate[s] to the viewer approval or encouragement of the behaviour involved thereby normalising the depraving or corrupting behaviours".
- WATCH:
- Perhaps more surprisingly, it is an offence to possess non-photographic child pornography (i.e. computer-generated images, cartoons, manga images and drawings) under section 62 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 – even where no children at all were harmed in its making. Critics claim that section 62 is our closest embodiment to an Orwellian "thought police" crime. Its intention, though, is to circumvent the non-photographic pornography triggering a sexual interest in young people that manifests itself in more traditionally criminal ways (i.e. possessing child pornography or committing a sexual offence against a child). If the net of criminal liability is cast wide enough to encompass this kind of content, there's a compelling argument to criminalise inventions like Roxxxy, too.
- Some have argued that the frigid Farah setting is akin to consensual "non-consensual" roleplay, for example two consenting adults enacting "rape fantasies". But knowledge that one's sexual partner is consenting is the crucial difference. Whether this consent is knowingly disguised or not, its existence enables some to take pleasure in the pain or restriction of their sexual partner (indeed, its existence is the very foundation of the S&M community). There must be a distinction psychologically between this – sexual pleasure derived from the joint pretence of overpowerment, which is at all times mandated by the "overpowered" person – and sexual pleasure derived from the actual overpowerment of a person. The robots are designed to ape the latter, and in doing so they condition the link between pleasure and a lack of consent.
- In law, rape is the penile penetration by A of the mouth, anus or vagina of B, without B's consent and without A's reasonable belief in B's consent. For a rape conviction, the Crown must prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. We may yet see a case where a defendant's use of Frigid Farrah-type technology is advanced before the jury as evidence of his predilection for non-consensual sexual acts, thereby undermining any defence that they either didn't have sex or that the complainant consented to it.
- It has been suggested that there is an inherent unfairness in criminalising a product which allows some men to live out their sexual fantasies. We don't criminalise women for wanting to take part in consensual non-consenting role play (i.e. a rape fantasy), so why not allow men equal free rein over their bedroom activity?
- But these acts don't divide neatly between genders. Women can use sex robots; men partake in role play. But the real issue is that these activities aren't interchangeable, because fantasising victimhood is not the same as fantasising criminality. Only products which foster the same consent-blind, pro-criminal sexual behaviour are equally harmful, and should be outlawed accordingly.
- The sophistication of the design and technology behind Roxxxy marks a step forward for robotics. For human society, it feels like a regression.

- The lifelike robots are becoming more sophisticated - some of which have a resistance setting
- SEX robots that allow men to enjoy “raping” them should be banned, a lawyer and campaigner has said.
- Kate Parker warned of the "uniquely sinister" technology of sex dolls made by robotics companies and slammed them for "normalising sexual violence".
- The Roxxxy sex dolls launched by True Companion, a US-based company, are made with a resistance setting to resist sexual advances.
- Current designs - often modelled on porn stars - are realistic, silicone-skinned sex dolls that can speak, use facial recognition, can take up to 50 sexual positions, fake orgasm and even “lurch backwards and forwards”.
- One of its lifelike dolls is Frigid Farrah, described as “reserved and shy” on the company's website.
- It states if you touch her “in a private area, more than likely, she will not be to appreciative of your advance".
- Writing for law blog, 5 Paper Buildings, Ms Parker, founder of the Schools Consent Project, a charity that sends lawyers to teach pupils about consent, said: "The fact that she is not a thinking, feeling human does not make her existence unproblematic. The robots normalise sexual violence.
- "They service and provide a distraction for criminal impulses that should probably be subject to psychiatric intervention."
- She said the technology promoted "criminal sexual behaviour" and "should be outlawed accordingly".
- The campaigner added: “She added: Some say these robots reinforce the objectification of women and the commodification of sex; others, that they allow otherwise isolated individuals to experience intimacy."
- There are already adult sex robot brothels in Asia and several expected to come to Europe.
- The sex robot industry is worth an estimated £23million.
- Customers pay up to £12,000 for love machines with a variety of features including functioning G-Spots and the ability to talk.
- Some experts have made the hugely controversial suggestion that sex robots should be used in therapy, believing they may be helpful for prevention of violent assault, rape and paedophilia.

- There should be a ban on the import of sex robots designed to look like children, the author of a new report into the phenomenon has said.
- Prof Noel Sharkey said that society as a whole needed to consider the impact of all types of sex robots.
- His Foundation for Responsible Robotics has conducted a consultation on the issue.
- Only a handful of companies were currently making sex robots, said Prof Sharkey.
- But, he added, the upcoming robot revolution could change that.
- The report, Our Sexual Future With Robots, was written to focus attention on an issue barely discussed at the moment, he said.
- The report acknowledged that finding out how many people actually owned such robots was difficult because the companies that made them did not release the numbers.
- But, said Prof Sharkey, it was time society woke up to a possible future where humans and robots had sex.
- "We do need policymakers to look at it and the general public to decide what is acceptable and permissible," he said.
- "We need to think as a society what we want to do about it. I don't know the answers - I am just asking the questions."
- Companies making sex robots include Android Love Doll, Sex Bot and True Companion. Most have previously made realistic, silicone-skinned sex dolls and are now considering or starting to ship dolls that can move and speak.
- The most advanced of these is San Diego-based Abyss Creations, which ships a product known as Real Doll and is due to release a sex doll with artificial intelligence later this year. Called Harmony, the robot moves its head and eyes and speaks via a tablet-enabled app.
- The company has already released the app, which allows users to program moods and voices for an existing doll.
- The report considers a few options for how such robots could be employed as:
- The last of these was the most problematic, said Prof Sharkey.
- This video can not be played
- Aimee Van Wynsberghe, co-director of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics on the pros and cons of sex robots
- Sex dolls that resemble children do exist, and a court in Canada is currently determining whether owning one is illegal.
- Newfoundland resident Kenneth Harrison ordered a doll from a Japanese business called Harumi Designs.
- The company is on a Canadian watch-list, and the doll was intercepted at the airport. Mr Harrison was charged with possessing child pornography but has pleaded not guilty.
- In Asia, there are already brothels that use adult sex dolls. And there are reports that a doll-maker operated one in Barcelona, although this has not been verified.
- Dr Kathleen Richardson, a robot ethicist at De Montfort University, agreed with the report authors that child sex robots should be banned but stopped short of calling for a ban on all such sex dolls.
- "The real problem here is not the dolls but the commercial sex trade. Sex robots are just another type of pornography," she said.
- She believes such robots would inevitably "increase social isolation".
- She also criticises the report for what she said is a failure to address the issue of gender.
- "Why does the report have a picture of a male robot on the cover when we know that the doll market - which is driving this - is mainly female dolls?
- "It is perpetrating the idea that this is gender-neutral, but the truth is that there are not many women buying such dolls, it is largely driven by men and male ideas of sexuality."
- Prof Sharkey said that there was currently a mismatch between what those selling such dolls wanted their customers to believe about the dolls and the reality of what they offered.
- "The manufacturers of sex robots want to create an experience as close to a human sexual encounter as possible," he said.
- "But robots cannot feel love, tenderness or form emotional bonds. The best that robots can do is to fake it."
- Sex robots are a relatively new phenomenon and an obvious next stage for sex dolls, which have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. Most have silicone skin, articulated metal skeletons and realistic features such as hair and eyes.
- In the main, these dolls are designed in female form, although Sinthetics has had some commercial success with its male sex dolls.
- But Prof Sharkey has doubts about how human-like such dolls will become.
- "I can't see them as being like humans in the next 50 years. They will always be slightly spooky, and their conversation skills now are awful," he said.
- Dr Richardson also questioned whether such robots would become mainstream or even be possible technologically.
- "The report assumes that you can create a functioning robot that can respond to humans, but in fact it is incredibly complex," she said

- The first porn film I ever saw was about a holiday camp full of sex robots. The plot? White-coated scientists look on as holiday-makers’ fantasies are fulfilled by hot droids.
- Connoisseurs may guess that this was the 1978 classic Sex World, an X-rated pastiche of the Michael Crichton thriller Westworld.
- I didn’t see it in 1978, I hasten to add. I watched it on a jumpy, white-lined VHS tape in the early 1990s, when I was 18. How today’s teenagers will scoff at the idea of discovering porn so late in life! But I tell you what, kids: I made up for lost time.
- The main thing I remember about watching that film is the effort to put robots out of my mind. I do not find the idea of robots sexy. Not even Mr Spock.
- (I have written that deliberately to annoy people, ie my husband. I bet Mr Spock isn’t a robot. And I bet my husband will think the difference between a robot and whatever Mr Spock “is” is an important difference. It is not.)
- Anyway, the idea of being able to see actual people having actual sex, on camera, was so mind-blowing that the only obstacle to enjoyment was this pesky automaton plot. The narrative’s determination to persuade me that these were not real people fought a distracting battle against my brain’s dazzled attempt to take in the fact that these were real people.
- In the end, I had to let my tired mind accept the whole robot thing and concentrate instead on the idea that “real scientists” were watching.
- What can I tell you? Robots don’t do it for me, but scientists… hello, professor! Do let me help you out of those wet spectacles.
- I was thinking about this during a recent debate about the “realistic sex robots” that will definitely exist within 10 years, according to experts and an eager reporting press.
- Academics from Sheffield and Delft have warned that we must be ready to grapple with unprecedented ethical complications (and it seems that’s not all we’ll be grappling with).
- Meanwhile, Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism project, has written a typically strong and articulate essay for the New York Times about the dangers of robots that can’t give consent and might end up “normalising rape by giving it a publicly acceptable face”.
- The focus of concern is an existing robot, classily named Roxxxy TrueCompanion, with various programmable personalities including “Wild Wendy”, “S&M Susan” and “Frigid Farrah: if you touch her in a private area, more often than not she will not be too appreciative of your advance.”
- That does sound dodgy. Then again, why should we assume customers will have sex with Frigid Farrah? Perhaps the point is for a million ordinary, healthy buyers to nod gloomily as they walk away from Farrah’s daily rejection, in order to increase the joy of that one day every couple of months when Wild Wendy comes out of the traps. I think we’ve all been in relationships like that.
- In my experience as an investigator, reviewer and one-time director of pornography – as I say, I made up for lost time – there is no legislating for people’s sexual psyches.
- (I mean that figuratively. Literally, of course, there is a great deal of legislating for people’s sexual psyches, and not all of it pointless.)
- The company behind the Roxxxy TrueCompanion boasts that its robots “allow everyone to realise their most private sexual dreams”. Oh bless them. Everyone? Because the doll has four settings? My lord. There are people out there who can’t get off unless they’re wearing a welding mask and listening to Gilbert and Sullivan while a giant postman tickles them ’til they wee.
- People are complicated.
- And yet people are, at the same time, uncomplicated. There is nothing new under the sun. In prehistoric times, primitive men used tree stumps and rotten turnips for the same purpose that they now use the Roxxy TrueCompanion. Does the scene turn more sinister if the caveman gives his turnip a nice grass wig, or less so?
- When it comes to rape, I’m persuaded this is not about sexual fantasy anyway, but only violence. If a man’s going to do that, he’s got something wrong with him that shouldn’t be affected one way or another by a robot. “Normalised” rape would have no attraction for that pervert: transgression is half the point.
- I hope that’s true, because otherwise my involuntary reaction to this debate is quite wrong. I admire Laura Bates and I fear and condemn rape – of course I do. Nevertheless, I think there’s something funny about a sex doll that doesn’t want to have sex with you.
- I mean, no sex dolls want to have sex with you; the imagination always had to do most of the work. It’s a long time since I’ve been in a sex shop, but you used to be able to buy a “simulacrum”: essentially, a bit of plastic with a hole in it. No doubt, while enjoying the device, some people imagined the hole to belong to Marilyn Monroe, others to an unconsenting donkey. Or a relative. Perhaps some users simply dreamed they were humping a doughnut. (Although it would seem an unnecessary expense to buy a fake plastic doughnut when you can get six of the real thing for a pound at Lidl.)
- Or, of course, you could buy a full-on doll. You know, those inflatable ones with the weird puffy faces. Whatever effort was put in to create the “Miss World doll”, the “Jenna Jameson doll” or the “Miss Black Fantasy doll”, there was no getting away from the fact that you were basically rogering a lilo.
- This has been going on forever – certainly since Ovid wrote of Pygmalion kissing and fondling his statue until the gods took pity. Is there great danger in the statue becoming increasingly lifelike? We have to pray there isn’t.
