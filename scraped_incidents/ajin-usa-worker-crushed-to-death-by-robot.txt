- Regina Allen Elsea was killed when a robot she had been trying to fix at auto parts manufacturer Ajin USA restarted and crushed her.
- Elsea had entered a robotic station ('cell') containing several robots to clear a sensor fault on a piece of machinery that had stopped working during an assembly line stoppage. When inside the cell, one of the robots energised and she was struck by a robotic armm which pinned her against a piece of machinery.
- In November 2020, Ajin USA was ordered to pay USD 1.5 million after admitting violating federal safety standards before Elsea was crushed to death. It also had to complete three years of probation, during which it must comply with a safety compliance plan overseen by a third-party auditor.
- Ajin pleaded guilty to knowingly failing to enforce federal safety standards, including the mandatory use of so-called lockout/tagout procedures to prevent the type of incident that killed Elsea.
- Two weeks before Elsea's death, the US Labor Department fined Ajin USA and two staffing agencies USD 2.5 million for 27 safety violations.

- LAFAYETTE, Ala. (AP) — A judge on Monday ordered an auto parts manufacturer to pay $1.5 million after admitting violating federal safety standards before a worker was crushed to death by a robotic machine.
- The Department of Justice announced the company pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor criminal charge of willful violation of Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards.
- Regina Allen Elsea, 20, was killed in 2016 at the Ajin USA plant in Cusseta, Alabama. Elsea had entered a robotic station to clear a sensor fault during an assembly line stoppage when the robot abruptly restarted and crushed her. She died of her injuries.
- Ajin pleaded guilty to breaking the federal standard requiring the use of what’s called lockout/tagout procedures to prevent the type of sudden machine startup that killed Elsea.
- Justice Department officials said Ajin had developed the procedures but the company also knew that supervisors did not effectively enforce them over the years before the death.
- “Ajin knew its supervisors and managers were turning a blind eye to the company’s safety procedures. Now, Ajin must take responsibility for its conduct,” Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jonathan D. Brightbill of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, said in a statement.
- The company issued a statement saying that “Ajin USA remains deeply saddened by the death of our associate, Regina Elsea, resulting from a tragic accident.”
- “At Ajin, our employees are our most valuable resource and safety is our most important priority. Ajin has fully cooperated with the Department of Justice throughout the investigation of the accident. The company is fully committed to continuing to make our workplace as safe as possible for our employees,” the statement said.
- Judge Stephen Michael Doyle sentenced Ajin to pay a $500,000 fine and $1 million in restitution to Elsea’s estate. The company must also complete three years of probation, during which Ajin must comply with a safety compliance plan, overseen by a third-party auditor.
- Elsea was killed two weeks before her wedding. A separate civil lawsuit filed by her family is ongoing in state court.

- Regina Elsea was killed just two weeks after U.S. inspectors found two dozen safety violations at a South Korean-owned plant.
- Senior Reporter
- Regina Elsea was just starting her life. The Alabama bride-to-be had a new job, bought a brand-new car, and was two weeks from her wedding day.
- But in June 2016, the 20-year-old was crushed to death while trying to fix a machine at the automotive plant where she worked.
- Now Elsea’s mother has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company, Ajin USA, and recruitment agency Joynus Staffing. The complaint also lists several unidentified entities associated with the robotic machine as defendants.
- The lawsuit comes two weeks after the U.S. Labor Department fined the Cusseta, Alabama, auto parts supplier—which stamps metal parts for Hyundai and Kia vehicles—and two staffing agencies $2.5 million for 27 safety violations.
- The day Regina Elsea was killed, the assembly line stopped and she was among four of her coworkers to enter a robotic station to clear a sensor fault, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
- When the machine stopped, employees tried calling maintenance for help but didn’t get anyone on the phone, so they decided to try to fix the problem on their own, according to news reports and the Elsea family lawyer.
- Kendall Dunson of Beasley Allen Law Firm, which filed the wrongful death suit, told The Daily Beast that Ajin encouraged line employees to get a stalled machine “back up and running as quickly as possible.”
- “That encouragement leads to instances when people can get into harm’s way,” Dunson said, adding, “[Elsea] was just the one who happened to be there when the machine activated. Other employees were there and also put in harm’s way. They were just not injured or killed.”
- According to the lawsuit, filed in Chambers County Circuit Court, Elsea was operating an “unreasonably dangerous and defective” machine, which suddenly activated and crushed her while she was in a hazard zone.
- “Her knowledge as a good employee contributed to her death,” Dunson told The Daily Beast. “Had she not been able to activate the machine, she wouldn’t have been crushed.”
- Dunson said the robot should have been guarded with a sensor or a sensor mat, which would have prevented the machine from activating if a person is in a hazard zone. “She got treated like a car part and she got crushed and killed,” he said.
- The robot unexpectedly restarted around 11 a.m. that day, squashing Elsea inside the machine according to an initial report by WTVM.
- “My understanding is the victim walked around to the back side of the machine with her back turned to the robot and pushed something on the machine and it engaged and pushed her from the rear crushing her against another machine,” Chambers County Sheriff’s Office investigator Shannon Fraley said at the time.
- Authorities said that the machinery was not shut down, or “locked out, tagged out,” even after the death.
- “In fact, when I arrived I had to ask them to do it. It still had not been locked out, tagged out, even after the incident had taken place,” Fraley told WTVM.
- Elsea was transported to the East Alabama Medical Center, then flown to UAB Hospital, where she died the next morning from her injuries.
- OSHA said that Hyundai and Kia suppliers like Ajin USA, which opened in 2008 and employs 700 people in Cusseta, had been on notice before.
- In 2015, OSHA’s assistant secretary of labor, Dr. David Michaels, traveled to South Korea to warn the car companies of hazardous conditions at their suppliers.
- “This senseless tragedy could have been prevented if Regina Elsea’s employers had followed proper safety precautions,” Michaels said in a statement announcing the $2.5 million in fines against Ajin USA and staffing firms.
- “Kia and Hyundai’s on-demand production targets are so high that workers at their suppliers are often required to work six and sometimes seven days a week to meet the targets,” Michaels added. “It appears that—to reduce its own costs in meeting these targets—this supplier cut corners on safety, at the expense of workers’ lives and limbs.”
- OSHA issued a host of citations, including exposing workers to crushing and amputation hazards due to improper machine guarding, and failing to utilize energy control procedures to prevent machinery from starting up during maintenance.
- Ajin USA has not commented on the lawsuit. After OSHA announced fines against it, Ajin released a statement saying it is conducting its own investigation into the incident and will continue to cooperate with the agency.
- “We at Ajin remain deeply saddened over the tragic accident that took the life of one of our valued teammates, Regina Allen Elsea,” the company said.
- Elsea was one of 26 women in workplace fatalities in the 2016 fiscal year. A review of Department of Labor statistics shows that a total of 1,087 people were killed on the job from October 2015 to September 2016.
- One of those victims was Carmen Lindhardt, a Utah mother who died in February when she fell into an industrial mixer at a grocery store. As The Daily Beast previously reported, Lindhardt’s upper body was pulled into the machine.
- Elsea’s death has devastated her coworkers and family, which has not spoken to news media since the tragic incident.
- Her mother and stepfather had just renewed their vows in spring, and Elsea had served as a photographer of the event.
- Elsea and her twin sister were the babies of the family. She had two older sisters and two brothers, her obituary stated.
- “The family is extremely devastated,” Dunson said. “With the OSHA report coming out, it’s like it happened yesterday.”
- It’s the first Christmas and New Year’s without the young woman, who, along with her fiancé, had a menagerie of pets at their home. (Her twin sister took in Elsea’s cats, while her mother adopted her three dogs, Dunson said.)
- “She loved dogs, and could never turn a stray away. Her most special canine buddie was her much-loved ‘Cow,’” her obituary read.
- While Elsea’s mother has shied away from reporters, she’s taken to Facebook to mourn her daughter.
- “Yesterday made 6 months that our precious baby girl has been gone although some think I should be past it,” the grieving mother wrote last week.
- The mom also posted a link to a local news story on OSHA’s fines against the car-part supplier.
- “It’s not enough justice,” she wrote. “Nothing will ever be enough.”

- CHAMBERS COUNTY, AL (WTVM) - Chambers County investigators shared what they believe led up to a 20-year-old woman being impaled and crushed at an automotive supplier on June 18.
- The victim has been identified as Regina Elsea, who was newly-engaged and planning her wedding. She was critically-injured Saturday, then died on Sunday.
- The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA - has taken the lead on the investigation into the death at Ajin USA in Cusseta, AL.
- On Saturday around 11:00 a.m, Chambers County investigators say the machine on Elsea's line quit working, witnesses on her team told investigators they tried to inform maintenance to the problem so they could come fix it.
- "They stated they did try to notify maintenance, but to no avail, they did not answer the phone, so no one came to their line to fix the problem," Chambers Co. Sheriff's Office Investigator Shannon Fraley said. "My understanding is the victim walked around to the back side of the machine with her back turned to the robot and pushed something on the machine and it engaged and pushed her from the rear crushing her against another machine."
- Investigators say Elsea was impaled by two welding tips, as she was crushed between two machines. Fraley says it appears the machine was not "locked out, tagged out" meaning it wasn't turned off. He says that's standard safety protocol for most manufactures when a repair is being made."In fact, when I arrived I had to ask them to do it. It still had not been locked out tagged out, even after the incident had taken place," said Fraley.
- The question remains, was proper safety protocols and procedures being followed at the time of the 20-year-old's death? Before we could get to the door, security at Ajin USA turned us away and asked us to leave the property.
- Ajin USA management did release a statement, but it did not specifically address if safety protocols were being followed at the time of Elsea's accident.
- The statement, sent from David Wilkerson, General Manager of HR  and Administration with Ajin USA, reads:
- Ajin USA is deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Regina Elsea. Ajin takes any accident seriously, and a full investigation is being carried out into the full details of the incident. In the meantime, Ajin USA is retraining all employees on Ajin USA's safety precautions. Ajin USA will fully cooperate with the appropriate authorities, including OSHA, during the investigation process. The safety of our employees has been and continues to be our greatest priority.
- It could take months for OSHA to release their findings.
- According to the OSHA website, they have investigated four complaints at Ajin USA. One complaint in 2011 led to Ajiin being fined an initial penalty of $14,500.

- The independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission has affirmed citations issued by the U.S. Department of Labor's OSHA to a global auto parts supplier after the 2016 death of a 20-year-old machine operator at an Alabama manufacturing facility.
- The decision comes after Joon LLC---operating as AJIN USA---contested OSHA citations after an investigation of how an employee at its Cusseta, AL, facility suffered fatal crushing injuries in June 2016 in a robotic machine. OSHA inspectors learned the machine operator and three co-workers entered a robotic cell on the assembly line to clear a sensor fault when a robot inside the cell restarted abruptly, crushing a young woman inside.
- Its inspection led OSHA to cite AJIN USA for 51 safety violations, including 48 willful violations. On Feb. 10, an administrative law judge upheld the majority of the violations OSHA issued. AJIN USA will pay more than $1.3 million in penalties to address the violations.
- "No violation or penalty can recover a life lost needlessly. This case's resolution serves as a stark reminder to all employers that the U.S. Department of Labor will exhaust all available resources and actions to hold them accountable when they fail to meet federal requirements to protect the safety and health of their employees," said U.S. Department of Labor Regional Solicitor Tremelle Howard in Atlanta.
- In a September 2020 criminal case, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, Eastern Division, ordered AJIN USA to pay a $500,000 fine and $1 million in restitution to the deceased woman's estate after the company pled guilty to a charge of a willful violation of an OSHA standard.
- "Failing to lock out equipment causes far too many serious injuries and deaths," explained OSHA Regional Administrator Kurt Petermeyer in Atlanta. "In this case, a young woman lost her life because her employer took shortcuts to minimize downtime and maintain production."
- Based in Korea, AJIN USA is a global supplier of parts to Hyundai and Kia with manufacturing plants in the U.S., South Korea, China and Vietnam. At the time of the 2016 incident, the manufacturer employed approximately 700 workers at the Cusseta facility.
