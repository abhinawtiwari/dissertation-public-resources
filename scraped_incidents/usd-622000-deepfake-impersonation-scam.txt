- A legal advisor at a technology company in Fuzhou, China, has been defrauded of RMB 4.3 million (USD 622,000) after receiving a video call from a 'friend' who turned out to be a fraudster using AI face-swapping technology.
- According to local police, the fraudster stole an individual’s WeChat account and used AI to create a deepfake of the person's face. The fraudster made a video call to a businessman who was an existing contact on the individual’s WeChat app and told the businessman they needed to make a deposit during a bidding process. The businessman subsequently transferred RMB 4.3 million to the fake friend’s bank account without verifying their true identity.
- The police have since helped intercept some of the stolen funds. However, reports suggest approximately RMB 1 million is yet to be recovered. The scam is reckoned to be largest of its kind to date.

- Police are looking to educate the public about a new type of fraud that uses artificial intelligence to mimic faces and voices.
- The public security bureau of Baotou, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, is striving to raise awareness after recently handling such a case in which the victim was tricked into transferring a total of 4.3 million yuan ($612,000) via a company account after having a video chat with someone pretending to be his friend.
- With the cooperation of the bank, police were able to halt a transfer of 3.37 million yuan, but said they are still trying to recover 931,600 yuan that had already been sent.
- On April 20, a man surnamed Guo, a legal representative of a technology company in Fuzhou, Fujian province, received a video call via WeChat from a friend asking him for help.
- Guo's "friend" said that he was bidding on a project in another city and wanted to use Guo's company's account to submit a bid of 4.3 million yuan. He promised to pay Guo back immediately.
- The fake friend then sent a bank account number to Guo and then provided a screenshot of the bank transfer voucher to prove that the money had been transferred to Guo's company's account.
- Guo then transferred 4.3 million yuan to the provided account in two separate payments.
- When Guo called his real friend for verification after completing the transfers, his friend denied that he had made a video call to Guo or had asked him to transfer any money.
- Guo realized that he was deceived by a fraudster and called Fuzhou police immediately. After discovering that the fake friend's account was with Mengshang Bank in Baotou, Fuzhou police soon contacted Baotou police to stop the payment.
- With assistance from the bank, Baotou police successfully stop a transfer of about 3.37 million yuan from going into the fraudster's account. Fuzhou police also provided Baotou police with information about the remaining 931,600 yuan, which had already been transferred.
- Baotou police said they are working to recover the stolen money.
- "The person on the other side didn't ask me to lend him money during the chat. He said that he would transfer the money first, and then what I needed to do was transfer his money to his company's account," Guo said.
- "He chatted with me via video call, and I also confirmed his face and voice in the video. That's why we let our guard down," he added.
- The police warned the public about this new type of AI fraud. People are urged to be careful about sharing their personal biological information such as facial images and fingerprints and about disclosing identification and banking information too easily.
- The public was also reminded to check the identity of the other party through various communication channels such as through phone calls before transferring funds. Police added that people should report suspected fraud as soon as possible.

- 
- The debate around artificial intelligence, and its potential use for financial crimes, gained steam in China this week after a scammer used sophisticated “deepfake” technology to dupe a man of 4.3 million yuan ($622,000).
- The victim, surnamed Guo, who works at a technology company, received a video call via WeChat from a “friend” who sought his help to bid on a project in another city, state media China Daily reported.
- Police say the perpetrator used AI-powered face-swapping technology to impersonate the friend.
- 
- 
- “He chatted with me via video call, and I also confirmed his face and voice in the video. That’s why we let our guard down,” Guo told China Daily.
- Guo realised the call was a scam after he called his friend to confirm receipt of the transfer. When his friend denied making such a call, Guo alerted the authorities.
- Police in Baotou city, in the Inner Mongolia province, where the perpetrator’s bank account was located, said they had managed to stop the transfer of about 3.37 million yuan. Work to recover the remaining 931,600 yuan was ongoing, police added.
- The deepfake scam unleashed a heated debate around the threat to online privacy and security on China’s microblogging site Weibo.
- “This shows that photos, voices and videos all can be utilised by scammers,” one user wrote. “Can information security rules keep up with these people’s techniques?”
- By Monday, the hashtag “#AI scams are exploding across the country” gained more than 120 million views.
- The case comes at a time when China is tightening scrutiny of technology and apps capable of manipulating voice and facial data. New rules, in effect since January, ban the use of AI-generated content to spread “fake news”.
- The regulations from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) also direct providers of such technology to clearly label photos, videos and text as synthetically made or modified if they could be misinterpreted as real.
- Police in Baotou, meanwhile, urged the public to remain careful while sharing information such as facial images and fingerprints. It also asked people to verify the identity of such a caller through alternate modes like phone calls before making any financial transfers.

- A deepfake scam in China has increased fears that artificial intelligence will allow hackers to easily obtain financial information. Hackers using advanced AI software reportedly convinced a man in northern China to transfer money to his friend, but instead directed it to a fraudulent account.
- The victim was based in Baotou, a region in inner Mongolia, and local police reported the hacker used AI to recreate the friend’s likeness in a video call including his face and voice. The deepfake scam led the victim to believe he was wiring 4.3 million Yuan ($US622,000 or $863,500) for his friend to make a bidding deposit. When the friend told the victim he was unaware of the incident, the man reported the scam to the authorities who say they have been able to recover most of the stolen funds but are still working to recover the rest, Reuters reported.
- Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site, is being used as a forum to discuss the ongoing threat of deepfake scams, with the hashtag, “#AI scams are exploding across the country” going viral with more than 120 million views on Monday. “This shows that photos, voices, and videos all can be utilised by scammers,” one user wrote. “Can information security rules keep up with these people’s techniques?”
- This recent incident comes as AI scams have drastically increased worldwide, with reports of scammers using AI technology to replicate voices to receive money via phone calls. The Department of Homeland Security released a report warning about deepfake scams, saying, “It is apparent that the severity and urgency of the current threat from synthetic media depend on the exposure, perspective, and position of who you ask. The spectrum of concerns ranged from ‘an urgent threat’ to ‘don’t panic, just be prepared.’”
- In the UK, the CEO of a local energy firm wired €220,000 (approx. $US243,000) to a Hungarian suppliers bank account after receiving a phone call from his supposed boss. The voice actually belonged to a scammer who used AI voice technology to replicate the boss’s voice, and the CEO told The Wall Street Journal that he recognised the subtle German accent and said it carried the “melody” of his voice.
- Meanwhile, in the U.S., a police department in southern Wisconsin warned residents earlier this month about similar scams after receiving a report from someone who said they received a call from someone who “sounded like their relative,” NBC Chicago reported. Although police said they couldn’t officially verify that it was an AI-generated voice, they wrote in a Facebook post, “We want our community to be aware that this technology is out there.”
- The Department of Homeland Security said these scenarios will “undoubtedly increase as the cost and other resources needed to produce usable deep fakes simultaneously decreases.” To avoid being a victim, the DHS recommends calling the person who supposedly requested money to verify and be aware of the common scam requests which include asking “for victims to wire money, send cryptocurrency, or buy gift cards and give them the card numbers and PINs.”

- China’s biggest deepfake scam to date has led to warnings of a rise in fraud cases using AI tools such as face-swapping and voice mimicking. In the widely-discussed case, a Fuzhou tech firm’s legal representative was allegedly defrauded of RMB 4.3 million ($610,000), after receiving a video call from a “friend,” who turned out to be a fraudster using AI face-swapping technology. The case became a hot topic on social media after police confirmed its details, highlighting how AI can be used to con well-educated adults within minutes.
- Why it matters: AI regulation is still a developing subject in China. In mid-April, the country’s internet regulator issued a draft regulation on the use of generative AI and sought public feedback on the proposed measures. Initial excitement around the potential of ChatGPT and similar AI products in China has given way to concerns over how AI could be used to supercharge criminal activity.
- Details: According to disclosures by police in the eastern Chinese city of Fuzhou, on April 20, a fraudster stole an individual’s WeChat account and used it to make a video call to a businessman, an existing contact on the individual’s WeChat app. They used AI to deepfake the individual’s face and told the businessman they needed to make a bank transfer. The businessman subsequently transferred RMB 4.3 million to the fake friend’s bank account without verifying their true identity.
- Context: The global buzz surrounding the launch of ChatGPT has seen a spate of AI-related product launches in China, with the country’s tech majors rushing to prove they can offer similar technology. However, the Fuzhou fraud case has combined with other high profile deepfake incidents to remind people of the potential downsides to such advances in artificial intelligence.

- 某天，你的一位熟人发来借钱的请求，随后对方打来了视频。视频接通后你确认长相和声音就是熟人“本人”，你没有怀疑把钱转了过去。没过多久，你发现自己被骗了，刚才视频里那位“熟人”并不是真的他。
- 这可不是鬼故事，而是已经发生在多位受害者身上的真实案例。
- 只需一张照片、10分钟声音素材
- 近日，一则10分钟被AI骗走430万元的新闻刷屏。据警方通报，受害人郭先生遇到的就是上述情形，骗子通过智能AI换脸技术，佯装成好友对他实施了诈骗。
- 尤其值得警醒的是，据公开报道显示，利用AI 技术实施诈骗，此前已有多起相似案例。而这些案件背后，均涉及了AI换脸以及声音合成技术。
- 目前，AI换脸随处可见，在短视频平台，不少用户都体验过换脸带来的新鲜感。这项技术也越来越成熟，仅需提供一张照片，就可以让你变成视频中人，或直接生成会眨眼、张嘴的视频。
- 七七(化名)专门在网上接单用AI帮别人生成视频，“只需提供一张背景干净的正面照，我就能生成视频，不仅眼睛、嘴巴都会动，还能时不时动动头，非常自然。另外如果你提供文字，我还可以让视频中的人物口型对上，配合度很高，可以连续播放1分钟。”七七说，他目前做这个工作已经非常熟练，“一个晚上就能完工”。
- 除了快速AI换脸，用AI手段合成或克隆声音也越来越常见。
- 一位商家向中新经纬介绍，只需要提供某人一段10分钟至30分钟的声音素材，要求没有杂音，就能用2天左右时间生成一个专属模型，后续输入任何文字，发出的都是这个人的声音。
- “这个办法属于一劳永逸，而且这个模型不仅能读文也能唱歌。一般来说，提供的素材时间越长，最终相似度越高。”上述商家介绍。
- 成本低至数十元
- 据中新经纬了解，目前制作一套“露脸且说话”的视频成本不高。七七表示，用照片生成一段1分钟时长的视频仅需30元左右，如果视频时间比较短，且画面质量要求不高，这个价格可以再降，几块钱一段都可以。上述商家也表示，生成一个专属模型也只需要几十元。
- 这意味着，如果有人蓄意生成你的长相搭配你的声音的视频，花费也仅需数十元。
- 不过，对于前述警方通报的案例，网友们也有疑问。比如不法分子是如何获得的郭先生好友的照片及声音素材？本应是即时的视频聊天，郭先生的手机里为何播放的是合成好的视频？
- 电信分析师付亮对中新经纬表示，假冒某人声音、图像实施诈骗在十多年前就已经出现，严格说目前AI诈骗并不是新类型。“通报中没有详细说明不法分子是如何获取郭先生好友个人信息的，但有一点可以肯定，这位好友的社交媒体账号被盗了。不法分子可能是从社交媒体里直接获取了个人信息，也可能之前以骚扰电话的方式与郭先生的好友联系过，获取了其声音信息。”付亮分析。
- 而至于为什么接通视频通话，播放的却是已经合成好的视频，付亮分析认为可能是通过插件实现的。
- 据中新经纬了解，目前虚拟摄像头就可以做到这一点。利用一个程序，可以在视频通话中让对方看到任何你想播放的视频，其中也包括通过AI换脸和声音克隆合成的视频。
- 应对“高端”诈骗往往还得靠最朴素的手段
- 蓄意制作别人人脸、声音的视频是否违法？
- 北京嘉维律师事务所律师赵占领对中新经纬表示，目前未经他人许可使用其肖像，即使不以营利为目的，也侵犯肖像权。但对于声音来说，目前则不受著作权法保护。“但有些具有显著性的声音申请注册了商标，这种情况下是声音是受法律保护的。”赵占领说，如果将合成的视频用于诈骗，且达到一定的数额标准，那就涉嫌刑事犯罪。
- 目前，针对AI诈骗，包括北京反诈在内的各类平台已向公众发出提醒，甚至称“诈骗成功率接近100%”，并给出了一些提示。值得注意的是，由于对新技术辨别能力不强，这种新型AI诈骗给中老年人更是带来挑战。
- 在日常生活中，公众除了要注意个人信息保护，不轻易提供人脸、指纹等个人生物信息给他人，不过度公开或分享动图、视频外，还要增强意识，尤其是涉及财务往来，务必通过电话、见面等最朴素的途径核实确认，不要未经核实随意转账汇款，不要轻易透露自己的身份证、银行卡、验证码等信息。
- 此外，也要进一步提高和掌握辨别AI合成视频的能力、技巧，目前AI合成的视频虽已比较逼真，但在细节处如色彩分布、肌肤纹理、表情自然连贯性仍有较为明显的瑕疵。
