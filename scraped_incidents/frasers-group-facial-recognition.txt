- A group of UK politicians, peers and civil rights groups have condemned Frasers Group for its use of live facial recognition across its businesses, including Sports Direct, Frasers, and Jack Wills. The Facewatch system is intended to identify shoplifters from a database of actual and suspected criminals, and ensure safety, alerting staff when a suspect enters one of Fraser Group's stores.
- But rights groups Big Brother Watch, Liberty and Privacy International, together with over 50 parliamentarians and peers, wrote (pdf) to Frasers Group CEO Michael Murray that the technology is inherently 'invasive and discriminatory' and 'treats everyone who passes the camera like a potential criminal.'
- Frasers Group responded by saying its system was more accurate than the 87 percent associated with the Met Police highlighted by the campaigners, and that the UK Information Commissioner's Office had said Facewatch's use was lawful.

- Sports Direct's parent company says live face-recognition (LFR) technology has cut crime in its shops.
- The cameras check faces against a watch-list, using a system called Facewatch.
- On Monday, 50 MPs and peers supported a letter opposing the use of LFR by Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, which owns the company and other chains such as Flannels.
- The company says it tells shoppers when the technology is installed in a shop.
- Frasers Group told BBC News it took its responsibilities around LFR extremely seriously and stressed its effectiveness.
- "Since installing this technology, we have seen a significant reduction in the number of criminal offences taking place in our stores," it said.
- The letter criticising its use was organised by campaign groups Big Brother Watch, Liberty and Privacy International.
- It says research into face-recognition technology suggests;
- The technology up-ends the democratic principle of suspicion preceding surveillance and "treats everyone who passes the camera like a potential criminal", the letter adds.
- Signatories to the letter come from across the political spectrum and include:
- In March, campaigners claimed the technology was used in at least 27 Frasers Group shops.
- Facewatch says its system is proven to prevent crime.
- "Unfortunately, in some stores, they experience unacceptable levels of threats and abuse to their staff by criminals. It is in those stores that they deploy Facewatch," company founder Simon Gordon told BBC News.
- The system alerted staff when someone on Facewatch's shared national face-recognition database entered a subscriber's shop, he said.
- Shop managers' requests to add someone to the database had to be backed-up with full witness statements and explanations, which a panel of former police officers reviewed before accepting, Mr Gordon said.
- "There is due process followed to ensure we only include individuals reasonably suspected of crime," he said.
- Shop staff and "accredited super-recognisers" - analysts with an aptitude for recognising faces - checked every alert, he told BBC News.
- Mr Gordon disputes the accuracy claims the letter makes about the Met Police's LFR, saying Facewatch is more than 99% accurate.
- His figures have not been independently audited.
- Facewatch says its LFR system follows the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice, which applies to police and local authorities but is optional for private companies.
- The code has been criticised as providing only "bare-bones" guidance - and some experts suggest new laws are needed.
- But Mr Gordon said the Information Commissioner's Office had confirmed Facewatch's use was lawful.
- The ICO has previously, however, expressed serious concerns about LFR technology, saying deployments must meet a "high bar".
- "We should be able to take our children to a leisure complex, visit a shopping centre or tour a city to see the sights without having our biometric data collected and analysed with every step we take," the previous information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, blogged.

- Exclusive: Cross-party collection of parliamentarians write letter to Sports Direct owner’s company
- Almost 50 MPs and peers have written to Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group, the corporate owner of the tycoon’s retail portfolio including House of Fraser and Sports Direct, condemning the use of “live facial recognition” cameras in the group’s stores.
- Describing the technology as “invasive and discriminatory”, the parliamentarians, a cross-party collection including David Davis, John McDonnell and Tim Farron, have urged the group to end the use of the cameras across the country.
- “Live facial recognition [LFR] technology has well-evidenced issues with privacy, inaccuracy, and race and gender discrimination. LFR inverts the vital democratic principle of suspicion preceding surveillance and treats everyone who passes the camera like a potential criminal,” the letter argues.
- “The technology obtains the facial biometric data – information as sensitive as a fingerprint – of every customer entering the store to check them against your privately created watchlist. This is the equivalent of performing an identity check on every single customer.”
- The letter, which was coordinated and co-signed by the privacy groups Big Brother Watch, Liberty and Privacy International, argues that as well as being wrong on principle, facial recognition technology is also “inaccurate and ineffective”. “To date, 87% of alerts generated by the Metropolitan police’s own live facial recognition system have been inaccurate. The poor accuracy of LFR technology also disproportionately impacts people of colour and women.”
- Speaking to the Guardian, Davis said: “There are no rules: this is open season on privacy. Just this month, there was a case of Tesla employees getting into trouble because they were misusing photographs from inside the cars. It’s a good demonstration that even if there are promises made, you can never trust the organisation entirely, because human beings are human beings.”
- The Salford and Eccles Labour MP, Rebecca Long-Bailey, another signatory of the letter, said: “The use of live facial recognition cameras to target customers is an invasive and abusive practice. For a hugely wealthy and powerful company to be monitoring people in this way is outrageous. The practice must be halted immediately.” The Ilford South Labour MP, Sam Tarry, added: “Private companies should not be able to reenact dystopian practices more fit for Orwell’s world of 1984 than a free and tolerant society.”
- Frasers Group has been contacted for comment. Previously a spokesperson has said surveillance is carried out to “ensure the safety of our staff and to help prevent theft”.
- In March, it was revealed that Sports Direct and Flannels, two of the brands operated by Frasers Group, were already using the cameras in at least 27 stores. The cameras scan the faces of every shopper, and check them against a database of suspected shoplifters, in an attempt to pre-emptively flag and either monitor or evict those who may cause trouble.
- If staff desire, they can add the face of any visitor to the database as a “subject of interest”, and monitor them for up to a year. No criminal conviction is necessary, and shoppers can be added to the database on suspicion only.
- The Information Commissioner’s Office has issued a warning about the use of such technology. Live facial recognition “could lead to unfair treatment of individuals”, involves “the automatic collection of biometric data at speed and scale without clear justification” and offers targets no opportunity to opt-out or control the use of their personal data. As a result, it said, “where LFR is used for the automatic, indiscriminate collection of biometric data in public places, there is a high bar for its use to be lawful”.
- Other data protection authorities have been more explicit. In the Netherlands, the Dutch DPA issued a formal warning to a supermarket that had launched a similar system to Frasers. Cameras were used to scan the face of everyone who entered the store and compared with a database of people who had been banned from the premises, but the DPA said such a system was “unacceptable”. “Use of such technology outside the home is banned in nearly all cases, and that’s for good reason.”

- Almost 50 MPs and peers have written to Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group and condemned the use of “live facial recognition” cameras across its retail estate.
- The technology is reportedly in use across various Frasers Group businesses including Sports Direct, Flannels, Frasers, and Jack Wills.
- The biometric cameras scan the faces of shoppers and check them against a database of suspected criminals. Staff are then alerted when artificial intelligence (AI) cameras spot an offender. In these instances, staff can either escort offenders from the shop or closely monitor them.
- A spokesman for Frasers Group said it was using the cameras "to ensure the safety of our staff and to help prevent theft".
- According to reports from The Guardian, the technology has been described as “invasive and discriminatory” by a cross-party collection of MP's including David Davis, John McDonnell and Tim Farron.
- “Live facial recognition [LFR] technology has well-evidenced issues with privacy, inaccuracy, and race and gender discrimination. LFR inverts the vital democratic principle of suspicion preceding surveillance and treats everyone who passes the camera like a potential criminal,” the letter argues.

- One of Britain's biggest retailers is using controversial facial recognition cameras to identify thieves – amid claims police have given up arresting shoplifters.
- Frasers Group, the owner of Sports Direct and fashion chain Flannels, has installed biometric cameras that scan the faces of shoppers and check them against a database of suspected criminals.
- Staff at the retail empire – controlled by billionaire Mike Ashley – are alerted as soon as the artificial intelligence (AI) cameras, which are in at least 27 stores, identify an offender so they can either escort them from the shop or closely monitor them.
- Civil liberties campaigners last night claimed millions of shoppers will be subjected to 'Orwellian surveillance', while the Information Commissioner's Office revealed that it was investigating whether their use is lawful.
- But crime experts say shopping chains are being forced to take action amid an 'epidemic' of shoplifting and the police's failure to arrest thieves.
- Civil liberties campaigners last night claimed millions of shoppers will be subjected to 'Orwellian surveillance'
- Frasers Group, the owner of Sports Direct and fashion chain Flannels, has installed biometric cameras that scan the faces of shoppers
- Shoplifting has rocketed from 2.9 million incidents in 2016/17 to 7.9 million last year, according to the British Retail Consortium.
- The cost to retailers almost doubled from £503 million to £953 million in the same period.
- Daniel Garnham, an ex-police officer and president of the Security Industry Federation, which represents security guards, said police regard shoplifters who steal items worth less than £200 as a 'low priority' and will not arrest them.
- David McKelvey, a former Detective Chief Inspector at the Metropolitan Police who now runs a private investigations firm, said many retailers 'no longer bother calling the police' when criminals target their stores.
- An investigation by campaign group Big Brother Watch, shared exclusively with The Mail on Sunday, identified a string of stores run by Frasers Group that have installed the so-called 'Facewatch' facial recognition system to detect shoplifters.
- They included 13 Flannels, 12 Sports Direct and two USC stores.

- Staff can retain images of those who they 'reasonably suspect' have stolen items or committed other crimes and upload them on to a 'watchlist'
- The company, which has more than 950 UK stores, has declared that 'the rollout continues', raising the prospect that the technology could soon be commonplace on the high street.
- Under the Facewatch system, cameras scan the faces of all those who enter a shop.
- Staff can retain images of those who they 'reasonably suspect' have stolen items or committed other crimes and upload them on to a 'watchlist'. The images of everyone else are deleted.
- The images of so-called 'subjects of interest' can be shared with other shops that use Facewatch and are retained for a year unless the suspect is believed to have offended again.
- Southern Co-op supermarkets, have also installed the cameras in 34 branches, as have some Spar, Budgens, Costcutter and Nisa stores.
- Nick Fisher, the chief executive of Facewatch, said the system is preventing 'thousands of crimes a month'
- The images of so-called 'subjects of interest' can be shared with other shops that use Facewatch and are retained for a year
- Jake Hurfurt, of Big Brother Watch, said the rollout of the cameras in Frasers Group stores was 'deeply concerning'
- Companies that capture facial recognition images must ensure that the processing of the information 'can be justified as fair, necessary and proportionate'
- Under data protection laws, companies that capture facial recognition images must ensure that the processing of the information 'can be justified as fair, necessary and proportionate'.
- The Information Commissioner's Office said it was 'assessing the compliance' of a small number of private companies with the Data Protection Act, with Facewatch 'among the organisations under consideration'.
- Critics have questioned the accuracy of facial recognition technology.
- In 2019, an independent report found that software used by the Metropolitan Police to identify potential suspects was wrong in 81 per cent of cases.
- Jake Hurfurt, of Big Brother Watch, said the rollout of the cameras in Frasers Group stores was 'deeply concerning'.
- A spokesman for Frasers Group said it was using the cameras 'to ensure the safety of our staff and to help prevent theft'.
- Nick Fisher, the chief executive of Facewatch, said the system is preventing 'thousands of crimes a month'.
- The National Police Chiefs' Council, said: 'We are constantly looking for ways to improve how we support businesses in preventing shoplifting, reporting offences, and catching offenders, and will continue to actively engage with retailers, shopworkers and other partners.'

- UK lawmakers have written Frasers Group, which owns several retail chains, to condemn its use of live facial recognition and call for it to stop using the technology, The Guardian reports.
- The retail conglomerate which owns House of Fraser, Sports Direct, and Flannels has deployed biometric cameras from Facewatch to dozens of locations.
- More than 40 Members of Parliament representing the nation’s three major political parties signed a letter to the retail group urging it to abandon technology they call “invasive and discriminatory,” and which “inverts the vital democratic principle of suspicion preceding surveillance and treats everyone who passes the camera like a potential criminal.” The letter was coordinated and co-signed by privacy advocacy groups Big Brother Watch, Liberty, and Privacy International.
- Facewatch has been approved both by the Information Commissioner’s Office and to the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice this year. Neither is mentioned by the Guardian, but a warning about the potential harms of live facial recognition from the ICO is noted.
- The controversy has a familiar ring, and occurs alongside a workshop held in the UK and asking how the controversies around AI can be shifted to the ones that society needs.
- Facial recognition was the most frequently mentioned topic among concerns about AI explored in the recent ‘Shifting AI controversies’ workshop, hosted by Shaping AI, an international research project hosted by the University of Warwick.
- Participants specifically noted concern with the use of facial recognition in public spaces like schools, streets, and public transportation.
- A 2017 paper suggesting face biometrics can be used for more accurate analysis of individuals’ sexual orientation is identified as a major source of concerns.  The other concerns discussed relate to algorithmic discrimination, such as in systems used in U.S. courts, data sharing between the public sector and researchers, large language models and machine learning for artificial general intelligence.
