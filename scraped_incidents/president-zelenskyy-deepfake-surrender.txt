- As Russia expands its assault on Ukraine, the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) is keeping a close eye on Russia’s movements across the military, cyber, and information domains. With more than five years of experience monitoring the situation in Ukraine, as well as Russia’s use of propaganda and disinformation to undermine the US, NATO, and the European Union, DFRLab’s global team presents the latest installment of the Russian War Report.
- Hacked news program and deepfake video spread false Zelenskyy claims
- Municipal VK accounts use children and patriotism to justify Ukraine invasion
- Russia claims to have “obtained documents” proving Ukraine was preparing invasion of its eastern regions
- Russia threatens to block YouTube
- Information fog surrounds Russian TV journalist who conducted on-air protest
- Suspicious Facebook page creates ads calling for people to join Ukraine’s International Legion
- New Belarusian constitution revoking non-nuclear status goes into effect
- Economic sanctions continue to mount on Belarus
- A national news broadcast on the television channel Ukraine 24 was breached by hackers on March 16. The program’s news ticker was hacked to display messages to appear as though they were coming from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The messages urged Ukrainians to stop fighting and give up their weapons, while claiming that Zelenskyy “wanted to take Donbas” but was unsuccessful, so he had fled Kyiv.
- The TV network confirmed that the news ticker was hacked and the messages were false. In response, Zelenskyy also filmed a short video debunking the messages and calling them a childish provocation.
- On the same day, the pro-Kremlin Telegram channel “Operational” reported that hackers published to Ukrainian websites a deepfake video of Zelenskyy repeating similar messages. The Telegram channel shared a video file, which according to its metadata was created on March 16, two hours before being uploaded to Telegram. Notably, the messages shared in the ticker and the deepfake video, encouraging Ukrainians to surrender, were amplified on VKontakte (VK), the Kremlin-owned social media platform that is similar to Facebook. Some commenters in Russia hypothesized that Zelenskyy uploaded the video in desperation and then backtracked after reconsidering.
- The deepfake video was debunked very quickly by Zelenskyy and was ridiculed by Ukrainians who noted the poor quality of the video and audio.
- —Roman Osadchuk, Research Associate
- Several accounts on the Kremlin-controlled social media platform VKontakte are posting “copy pasta” (slang for copying-and-pasting identical text) to justify Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine. While some of the accounts are personal, others belong to municipal organizations. The text repeats Kremlin narratives suggesting that the war “was needed to stop the shelling of Donbas” and that “Ukraine should be purged from nationalists.” It also stated, “It is absolutely clear that all these sanctions would have been imposed anyway.” The copypasta trend was first spotted by Russian journalist Dmitry Kolezev.
- The identical posts used the hashtags #своихнебросаем (“do not leave ours behind”), #Zанаших (“For ours”), #Zапрезидент (“For the president”), and #Мывместе (“We are together”). Other posts using these hashtags feature kids being physically arranged to form the letters “Z” or “V,” the symbols of the Russian invasion, or children holding a piece of paper with the hashtags written on them.
- Another notable campaign featured a video that depicts young people supporting the invasion. The video includes text that says, “Stalingrad is ours!” This video intends to highlight the famous World War II battle in an effort to draw patriotic support for the war in Ukraine. The original video was published on the “Young guard” page. Fifty minutes after the initial post, five municipal entities from the Frolovsky district reshared the video, all within three minutes of each other. One hour later, eighteen posts were shared, all within two minutes of each other, by municipal bodies such as schools or cultural institutions, in the Elantskiy district of Volgograd. This suggests there was a centralized decision by regional government entities to share the same posts on VK locally .
- The use of children to promote pro-war hashtags and the focus on municipal entities resharing the same content suggests a push for “patriotic” civic content. While most of the posts did not reach a broad audience, it is significant that multiple accounts participated, amplifying the reach of the posts.
- —Roman Osadchuk, Research Associate
- In an attempt to further justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin continues to present “proof” – in the forms suspicious documents and verbal statements – of Kyiv’s intentions to attack its eastern regions. Alongside unfounded claims that Ukraine planned to use “dirty nuclear bombs” and bioweapons against the Donbas region and Russia, the Kremlin stated that they obtained documentary evidence showing Kyiv’s plan to “invade the territories of Donetsk People’s Republic, Luhansk People’s Republic, and Crimea.” According to Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Nikolay Patrushev, “the documentary evidence” was obtained during “Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine.”
- Kremlin media previously promoted claims that Kyiv was planning to attack Donbas prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to create a pretext and prepare justification for Moscow’s attack.
- —Eto Buziashvili, Research Associate, Tbilisi, Georgia
- On March 14, the Russian state censor threatened to block Google’s YouTube video platform in the country. This marks the first time that the Russian government has made such an explicit threat. Following Russia’s ban of Instagram, YouTube remains the largest Western social media platform still available to Russian citizens. In 2021, YouTube reported 58 million Russian users, making it the video service’s fifth-largest national market.
- The impetus for the Russian government threat was YouTube’s March 11 decision to remove all Russian state-funded media channels globally. Specifically, Russia has demanded the reinstatement of channels funded by its “Soviet Television: State Television and Radio Fund.” This fund focuses on the historical preservation of Soviet-era films, television, and newsreels and appears unrelated to current Russian war propaganda efforts. By basing its objection on a relatively noncontroversial state media channel – as opposed to RT, for example – Russia seeks to cast its confrontation with YouTube in the best possible light.
- Russia’s independent YouTube community is already reeling from YouTube’s March 10 decision to suspend all monetization within Russia. For now, the most popular Russian YouTube creators are still able to make some advertising revenue from foreign subscribers. Less popular Russian YouTube channels, however, have lost their income entirely. Speaking to Novaya Gazeta, Russian YouTube stars were pessimistic about their ability to rebuild their followings on VKontakte, noting that VK has already begun to ban independent media producers.
- Both Russian YouTube creators and those close to the Russian government express the sense that a YouTube ban is ultimately inevitable. As one Russian reporter close to the Kremlin recently warned Telegram followers, “The time has come for us to live without YouTube.”
- —Emerson T. Brooking, Resident Senior Fellow, Washington DC
- On March 14, Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Kremlin-controlled Channel One TV, interrupted a live broadcast of the primetime news program “Vremya.” Ovsyannikova stood in the background holding a poster that read: “No war, stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” In a pre-recorded video statement, she explained that she is against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine and expressed shame that she worked for Kremlin media. Channel One reportedly acknowledged the incident to Kremlin-owned TASS news agency.   Ovsyannikova was not heard from again until the evening of March 15, when she briefly talked with journalists after exiting the Ostankino district court building with her lawyer Anton Gashinsky. The court issued a fine of 30,000 rubles ($280).
- After the incident, Ovsyannikova’s name trended on Twitter in Russia and abroad, with some users suggesting she had gone missing. Ovsyannikova has an Instagram and Facebook account, but both provide limited public information. After the incident on “Vremya,” accounts impersonating Ovsyannikova appeared on Instagram and Twitter, neither of which are still accessible in Russia.
- Some of the fake accounts attempted to spread false information about Ovsyannikova. One account alleged that she previously supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while another spread false information about the sentence she is facing. Both accounts have been removed.
- Some Twitter users suggested that her appearance in the live broadcast was staged, as “everything is pre-planned in Putin’s Russia,” to “lift sanctions,” or to “whitewash ordinary Russians of their sins.” The Guardian and Meduza, meanwhile, published articles explaining how it would be possible for Ovsyannikova to interrupt a live broadcast.
- Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the incident as an “act of hooliganism.” Oleg Matveychev, the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Information Technology, and Communications, said it was a “provocation” and accused the US of paying Ovsyannikova “some $300 a month for this or $1,000 extra.” Kuban Oblast Governor Anna Minkova, who claimed to be the former boss of Ovsyannikova while she worked for Kuban television, characterized her as lazy and opportunistic. The inconsistency of these messages suggests that Ovsyannikova’s appearance took the Kremlin by surprise.

- On March 15, POLITICO correspondent Mark Scott tweeted about a Facebook page called “Ukrainian Legion” publishing advertisements calling on foreigners to join the International Legion of Defense of Ukraine. One day later, he tweeted that Meta is removing the Ukrainian Legion page for violating the company’s terms of service, specifically its policy against impersonation. The Facebook page was created on March 9 under the category “charity organization.”
- The DFRLab searched for the page’s ads in the Facebook Ad Library and although the page was already removed, roughly forty ads are still visible in the library. The ads were targeted to Facebook and Instagram users in different countries, including Poland, Sweden, Latvia, Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, United States, and Canada. The ads instructed users on how to apply to the International Legion of Defense of Ukraine, some of the ads contained the contact information for Ukrainian embassies in the countries targeted by the page admins.
- The first ad in the set available for viewing was launched on March 11 and was paid for in Ukrainian currency. For most of the ads, less than USD $100 was spent on promotion. The ads included barcodes and links leading to the website fightforua.org, which was developed by Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in March. However, the Ukrainian Legion Facebook page is not listed on the fightforua.org website as a social media account run by the website.
- Facebook’s policy against impersonation includes the false representation of a brand, entity, or public figure. This implies that the Ukrainian Legion Facebook page was not connected to the official government effort to recruit foreign fighters.

- On March 15, Belarus’s new constitution went into effect, officially depriving the country of its previously neutral stance and revoking its non-nuclear status. The referendum on the constitutional amendments was held on February 27 and was allegedly supported by 82.86 percent of the population. As a result, the new constitution revokes Belarus’s non-nuclear status, allowing Russia to share and store nuclear technology in Belarus. According to a report from EUvsDisinfo, the result of the vote was falsified and the turnout was exaggerated. The report says that low turnout and minimal media coverage demonstrate “Lukashenka’s submission to the Kremlin.”
- Some small anti-constitution protests were recorded in Belarus on March 15, but they were quickly dispersed.
- —Lukas Andriukaitis, Associate Director, Brussels, Belgium
- Western countries continue to mount economic sanctions against Belarus as a punishment for cooperating with Russia in the war against Ukraine.
- On March 16, Switzerland’s Federal Council announced its decision to implement sanctions on Belarus. Switzerland said it would adopt the same sanction regime as the European Union. The US, UK, and the EU all imposed new economic sanctions on Russia and Belarus over the past two days. The UK has added 300 more sanctions on Russia and Belarus, bringing the number of sanctions to more than 1,000. Meanwhile, the EU has already imposed its fourth set of sanctions against Russia.
- Meanwhile, on March 12, videos emerged of Polish activists blocking cargo trucks from entering Belarus. The activists refuse to let the trucks pass, claiming that the trucks are subject to the sanctions imposed on Russia. Activists say the trucks are transporting materials for Russia to continue its assault on Ukraine. The blockade was still in place at the time of writing.

- Facebook and YouTube said Wednesday that they removed uploads of a deepfake video of Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky that purported to show him yielding to Russia.
- The deepfake spread widely online Wednesday, as noticed earlier by Vice’s Motherboard. In the video, which CNN Business has reviewed, Zelensky appears to stand behind a presidential podium and in front of a backdrop, both of which feature the Ukranian coat of arms. Wearing a green shirt, Zelensky speaks in Ukranian, appearing to tell Ukranians to put down their weapons in the weeks-old war against Russia.
- Deepfakes — which combine the terms “deep learning” and “fake” — are persuasive-looking but false video and audio files. Made using cutting-edge and relatively accessible AI technology, they aim to show a real person doing or saying something they did not. Experts have long been concerned that, as they improve, they would be used to spread misinformation.
- In a series of posts on Twitter Wednesday afternoon, Meta’s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, wrote that the company spotted and removed the video earlier that day. “We’ve quickly reviewed and removed this video for violating our policy against misleading manipulated media, and notified our peers at other platforms,” he wrote.
- YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi said the video and reuploads of it have been removed from the platform because it violates the company’s misinformation policies. “We do allow this video if it provides sufficient education, documentary, scientific or artistic context,” Choi said in a statement.
- A Twitter spokesperson said the company is tracking how the video is shared across the social network, and has taken “enforcement action” in cases where it violates company rules (such as its synthetic and manipulated media policy, which forbids users from sharing altered content that may confuse people or lead to harm; in some cases, Twitter may label tweets containing misleading media to give users more context).
- How a deepfake Tom Cruise on TikTok turned into a very real AI company
- While the video doesn’t look tremendously doctored, there are some telltale signs that the video is not what it appears to be. And Zelensky himself appeared in a video posted to an official Ukraine defense account on Twitter, saying he is continuing to defend Ukraine and refusing to lay down weapons against Russia.
- Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and digital forensics expert, pointed out several of the obvious signs that the video is a deepfake. First, it’s a low-quality, low-resolution recording; this is a common trick to hide the distortions created when making a deepfake, as our brains tend to be more forgiving of glitches in low-quality videos. Second, the Zelensky in the video looks straight ahead without moving his arms throughout the clip — it’s very tricky to make a convincing deepfake that includes head motions and hands moving in front of the face. Third, there are little visual inconsistencies in the video, he pointed out, that occur during the process of making a deepfake, which is created a single frame at a time. Though Zelensky’s voice is harder for Farid to comment on, in part because he doesn’t speak Ukranian, he said it sounds a bit off to him.
- The video comes weeks after the official Facebook account for Ukraine Land Forces posted a warning that such videos of Zelensky may appear. “Be aware - this is a fake!” the account wrote, soon adding, “Rest assured - Ukraine will not capitulate!” That warning was accompanied by an image that appeared to show Zelensky in a similar shirt as what appeared in the deepfake video, in front of the same backdrop and behind the same podium.
- As of Wednesday afternoon, the video could still be found online, such as in some posts CNN Business spotted on Twitter and YouTube in which users made clear that it was a deepfake.
- While Farid doesn’t think the video fooled people, he thinks it “muddies the information waters,” making it harder for anyone to trust what they see.
- “Casting doubt on what you see and hear and read is a very powerful weapon in the information war and deepfakes are now playing a role in that,” Farid said.

- A Ukrainian television news outlet claims that its live broadcast and website were hacked on Wednesday, with a chyron falsely saying Ukraine surrendered, Ukraine 24 said in a Facebook post.
- Ukraine 24 posted a warning on Facebook that its broadcast and website were hacked. Adding to the chaos is a deepfake video of President Zelenskyy appearing to tell Ukrainians to surrender began to go viral online at the same time. Zelenskyy himself has since posted a video to say Ukraine will not surrender to Russia.
- “The running line of the ‘Ukraine 24’ TV channel and the ‘Today’ website were hacked by enemy hackers and broadcast Zelenskyy's message about alleged ‘capitulation’❗️❗️❗️ THIS IS FAKE! FAKE !” the Ukraine 24 post said.
- In a fake video that started spreading on social media on Wednesday, following the Ukraine 24 hack, Zelenskyy appeared to stand at a podium and address the Ukrainian “defenders,” telling them to lay down their arms and return to their families. According to an archived version of the Ukraine 24 website from Wednesday, as well as screenshots shared by journalists on Twitter, a transcription from the deepfaked video is visible:
- Dear Ukrainians! Dear defenders! Being president was not so easy. I have to make difficult decisions. At first I decided to return Donbas. It's time to look in the eye. It didn't work out. It only got worse. Much worse. There is no more tomorrow. At least in me. And now I decide to say goodbye to you. I advise you to lay down your arms and return to your families. You should not die in this war. I advise you to live, and I'm going to do the same.
- The Ukraine 24 website is still down, and no one has claimed responsibility for the alleged hack or the fake video.
- On March 2, the official Facebook account for the land forces of Ukraine posted a warning about deepfaked videos: “Imagine seeing Vladimir Zelenskyy on TV making a surrender statement. You see it, you hear it - so it’s true. But this is not the truth! This is deepfake technology,” it wrote. “This will not be a real video, but created through machine learning algorithms. Videos made through such technologies are almost impossible to distinguish from real ones.”
- The Defense Intelligence of Ukraine has also been warning about deepfaked disinformation since early March, claiming that Russia might try to use AI-generated fake video in its favor:
- The one spreading around on social media today is actually pretty easy to distinguish from the real thing: His head looks like it’s been pasted onto a still photo of his body, standing at a podium. His face moves in a fairly convincing way—it blinks, after all, something deepfake detection experts used to claim wasn’t possible for AI to replicate–but it doesn’t look natural enough to fool anyone looking at it for more than a passing glance. It combines the video with an AI version of his voice, which sounds stilted and mechanical.
- After the alleged hack, Ukraine 24 posted a (real) video of Zelenskyy speaking to a phone camera to deny the claims made in the hack, and assert that Ukraine was not, in fact, surrendering.
- "Regarding the last childish provocation, that I’m offering to lay down arms. I can offer to lay down arms only to the militaries of the Russian Federation and to return home. And we are at home already. We defend our land, our children, our families. And we absolutely are not going to lay down our arms. Till our victory." Zelenskyy said in his message, according to a translation by VICE.
- U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio also posted the debunking video from Zelenskyy on Twitter. Rubio alleges that the Ukrainian president is speaking about the deepfake video—Rubio has advocated for more internet protections against deepfakes in the past.
- On Wednesday afternoon, Facebook’s head of security and policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, tweeted that the company’s platforms were identifying and removing the video wherever it cropped up:
- Since the advent of deepfake technology for casual use in late 2017, people have worried that malicious deepfakes would be used for political aims in the U.S.—to start a war, deceive the public or spread fake news faster than the already rampant disinformation on social media through more rudimentary means like text and fake photos. Earlier this month, people online tried to claim that Russia had deepfaked president Vladimir Putin into videos of meetings, which wasn’t true.
- In almost five years, a deepfaked president has yet to trick any countries into launching nukes, but amid near-constant disinformation spreading about Russia’s war against Ukraine, a news outlet hack and shitty AI-generated video just adds to the pile.

- A poorly done deepfake video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asking civilians to lay down their arms to the Russian military was circulated on social media in March 2022. In addition to getting some views on social media, a summary of this video was also broadcast on a Ukrainian news station after it was reportedly hacked. The running text at the bottom of this broadcast mentions the message from Zelenskyy's deepfake video.
- 
- Ukraine 24 posted a message on Facebook stating that this message was added to the broadcast after the network had been hacked:
- 
- The message reads in English (translated via Google):
- The running line of the "Ukraine 24" TV channel and the "Today" website were hacked by enemy hackers and broadcast Zelensky's message about alleged "capitulation."
- ❗️❗️❗️ THIS IS FAKE! FAKE !
- Friends, we have repeatedly warned about this. No one is going to give up. Especially, in the circumstances when the Russian army suffers losses in battles with the Ukrainian army!
· ·
- Zelenskyy, too, appeared to address this rumor in a video posted to his Facebook page. That video included the caption "Ми вдома і захищаємо Україну" or "We are at home and defending Ukraine" and, according to Ukraine 24, a message to Russian soldiers to lay down their arms.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ty_OGY_91U
- This likely isn't the last deepfake video we will encounter during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Propagandists have been working overtime to change the narrative of the war, and deepfakes, a term used to describe digitally edited videos to make it seem as if a real person is saying or doing something they never said or did, are just another tool in their disinformation toolbox.
- In the example above, most viewers can likely tell that the Zelenskyy footage is fake simply by looking at it. His head, for example, doesn't seem to quite fit on his neck. The best strategy to identify deepfakes, however, is to look for their source. Zelenskyy has recorded several videos using the same background on his social media profiles and on the official social media pages of the Ukrainian government. This deepfake, needless to say, was never posted to these pages.
- If you see a video that you think might be fake, try taking a screenshot from the video and then running a reverse-image search on Google Images, TinEye, or another reverse-image search engine. You can also send the video to Snopes and we'll do our best to authenticate it.

- A deepfake video of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenksy calling on his country's troops to surrender to Russian forces reportedly made it onto a hacked Ukrainian news site today after going viral on Facebook, The Daily Dot reports.
- According to the report, it may be the first deepfake created to deceive opponents during Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
- While the video isn't the cleanest or convincing example of deepfake technologies — it's clearly not the real Zelenksy in the video as, for one, the head is far too big for the body — it's an ominous example of a troubling new weapon in the arsenal of a world power: faked videos of statements made by enemy political leaders.
- The real Zelenksy was quick to respond to the deepfake in a separate video posted to Facebook, calling for Russians to surrender instead.
- "If I can offer someone to lay down their arms, it’s the Russian military," he said in the video. "Go home. Because we’re home. We are defending our land, our children, and our families."
- According to disinformation watchdog the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab), the video was aired on a hacked news program.
- "This is a fake!" Ukrainian outlet wrote in an Instagram post, as translated by Google. "Friends, we have repeatedly warned about this. Nobody is going to give up."
- Facebook's parent company Meta has since taken down the troubling video.
- "Earlier today, our teams identified and removed a deepfake video claiming to show President Zelensky issuing a statement he never did," the company's head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher tweeted. "It appeared on a reportedly compromised website and then started showing across the internet."
- "We've quickly reviewed and removed this video for violating our policy against misleading manipulated media, and notified our peers at other platforms," Gleicher added in a follow-up.
- The topic of disinformation has hit fever pitch as Russian troops turn major Ukrainian cities into rubble. Hackers are waging a secondary war online, taking down government websites and interfering with military operations.
- It's not even the only deepfake video to surface today, with a similar video of a deepfaked Russian president Vladimir Putin declaring victory also making the rounds.
- Meanwhile, Russia is shutting itself off from the world. The news comes after both Facebook and Instagram were completely blocked by Russian authorities earlier this month.
- But without major social media platforms, Russia has cut off a massive distribution channel of its own state propaganda as well.
- It's unclear, notably, if the deepfake video actually had its targeted effect of sowing confusion or even convincing Ukrainians to surrender to the enemy. Whether a deepfake ever will remains an open question.

- Meta removed an altered video falsely depicting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ordering troops to surrender Wednesday. The video is the latest alarming milestone in the parallel information war accompanying Russia’s brutal invasion of neighboring Ukraine, but it was a moment that Ukraine’s government and social media companies appear to have been prepared for.
- Meta Head of Security Policy Nathaniel Gleicher explained that the company removed the content for breaking its rules against “manipulated media,” a form of multimedia misinformation that often manifests as video edited to depict a public figure saying something that they never actually said.

- The misleading video was intercepted by Meta fairly quickly, but is apparently circulating widely on Facebook’s Russian counterpart VKontakte, according to the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. DFRLab also observed that a pro-Russia Telegram channel published a deepfake Wednesday depicting Zelensky calling on the country to surrender.
- National TV network Ukraine 24 also reported that its news ticker was hacked on Wednesday to similar ends. The ticker showed a message purportedly from Zelensky calling on the people of Ukraine to end their resistance against Russian invading forces.

- Ukraine’s president was quick to counteract the disinformation with his own messaging on Telegram, shot in the same selfie video style that’s characterized Zelensky’s communications since the beginning of the invasion.
- In early March, Ukraine’s Centre for Strategic Communications cautioned that Russia might deploy altered videos to distort public perception of its invasion. The center, part of the Ukrainian government’s Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, focuses on “[countering] external threats, in particular information attacks of the Russian Federation.”
- “Imagine seeing Vladimir Zelensky on TV making a surrender statement,” the center wrote on its Facebook page on March 2. “You see it, you hear it – so it’s true. But this is not the truth… Be aware – this is a fake!”

- A phony video of the Ukrainian president telling his soldiers to lay down their weapons is not the most convincing deepfake, but it could spiral into a dangerous pattern.
- National Security Reporter
- A fake video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appearing to tell his soldiers to lay down their weapons began circulating online this week, raising questions about just how easy it is for bad actors to influence the information flooding the zone as Russia continues to invade Ukraine.
- Experts have quickly debunked the apparent deepfake—in part because it’s almost laughable how badly made the video is, according to Mounir Ibrahim, vice president of impact at Truepic, a company with backing from Microsoft’s venture capital arm to help root out deepfakes or manipulated media online.
- “The fact that it’s so poorly done is a bit of a headscratcher,” Ibrahim told The Daily Beast. “You can clearly see the difference this is not the best deepfake we’ve seen—not even close.”  Ibrahim cautioned that he had not analyzed the apparent deepfake to verify exactly what kind of manipulated media it was, and whether it could be classified as a deepfake—media that had been manipulated using machine learning—or a cheap fake—altered media changed with cheap technology—or other synthetic media.
- But the most problematic part of this whole episode is not that the video exists—at least it has been called out quickly—but that bad actors, whether it’s government-backed activity or regular old tricksters, will increasingly be interested in taking advantage of using manipulated media to spread lies.
- “As we start seeing more and more cheap fakes, deepfakes flood the zone, it’s going to desensitize people and allow bad actors to allege ‘nothing is real on the ground, you can’t trust anything,’” Ibrahim told The Daily Beast. “And the existence of these fakes help amplify bad actors calls.”
- Confusion about the alleged deepfake has spread as false claims that Zelensky is surrendering also appeared on Ukraine's 24 TV channel. The channel said in a post on Facebook the chyron was fake, claiming it had been “hacked by enemy hackers.”
- Zelensky himself came out after the video began circulating with his own signature self-shot video reminding Ukrainians that if he were to tell anyone to lay down their arms, it would be the Russians.
- Facebook took down a fake Zelensky video Wednesday for violating its policy on manipulated media.
- “Earlier today, our teams identified and removed a deepfake video claiming to show President Zelensky issuing a statement he never did. It appeared on a reportedly compromised website and then started showing across the internet,” Nathanial Gleicher, Facebook or Meta’s head of security policy said in a statement.
- Ukraine warned early this month that Russia might seek to spread disinformation about its invasion in Ukraine by using manipulated videos of Zelensky appearing to announce surrender.
- “Videos made through such technologies are almost impossible to distinguish from the real ones,” Ukraine’s Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security under the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine, designed to call out misinformation, said in a statement. “Be aware—this is a fake! His goal is to disorient, sow panic, disbelieve citizens and incite our troops to retreat. Rest assured—Ukraine will not capitulate!”
- Combing through the disinformation about Russia’s invasion in Ukraine has been a daily battle since even before Russian President Vladimir Putin made the move to attack Ukraine last month. The Biden Administration warned Putin may work to create false flag attacks against his own forces in order to claim a justification for attacking Ukraine.
- More recently, Russia has been digging in on its false claims that the United States or Ukraine might use chemical or biological weapons against Russian forces—a web of disinformation that Zelensky has said could be a signal Putin himself plans to use chemical or biological weapons against Ukraine.
- And Russia has been claiming, without evidence, for months that the United States might be preparing a chemical weapons attack.
- And though this case of the apparent Zelensky deepfake has been quickly clarified, it may not be the last time bad actors will take advantage of Ukraine, or other conflict zones for that matter, by creating deepfakes or manipulated media meant to cause confusion or spread fake information.
- “Could this be random people throwing spaghetti at the wall, or is it a state backed actor? It could be any of the above. That underscores the issue… image deception, whether it is wholly synthetic or rudimentary, is now so democratized that anybody in theory could begin putting out either crappy deceptive media or really sophisticated deceptive media,” Ibrahim said.
- The faked video comes just as Russia's foreign minister has suggested publicly that a deal with Ukraine may be on the horizon soon enough.
- Three weeks into the war, though, Russian forces continue to hit civilians and civilian infrastructures. Just Wednesday, Russian forces reportedly attacked a theater in Mariupol.
- Zelensky has said in recent days, after multiple meetings aimed at negotiating peace failed to lead to successful cease fires, that Ukraine has begun to recognize that joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization may not be a realistic goal—a move that may be easing negotiations with the Russians.
- It is not clear exactly how a potential deal would play out, but it should involve Russian forces leaving Ukrainian territories taken since the invasion began, a Zelensky adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said.

- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks to members of the U.S. Congress from Kyiv in this image from video provided by the Ukrainian Presidential Press Office and posted on Facebook.
- A fake and heavily manipulated video depicting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy circulated on social media and was placed on a Ukrainian news website by hackers Wednesday before it was debunked and removed.
- The video, which shows a rendering of the Ukrainian president appearing to tell his soldiers to lay down their arms and surrender the fight against Russia, is a so-called deepfake that ran about a minute long.
- It is not yet clear who created the deepfake, but government officials in Ukraine have been warning for weeks about the possibility of Russia spreading manipulated videos as part of its information warfare. Ukraine's military intelligence agency released a video this month about how state-sponsored deepfakes could be used to sow panic and confusion.
- While the video shows a passable lip-sync, viewers quickly pointed out that Zelenskyy's accent was off and that his head and voice did not appear authentic upon close inspection.
- Officials at Facebook, YouTube and Twitter said the video was removed from their platforms for violating policies. On Russian social media, meanwhile, the deceptive video was boosted.
- "This is the first one we've seen that really got some legs, but I suspect it's the tip of the iceberg," said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley who is an expert in digital media forensics.
- A deepfake of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky calling on his soldiers to lay down their weapons was reportedly uploaded to a hacked Ukrainian news website today, per @Shayan86 pic.twitter.com/tXLrYECGY4
- In a video posted to his Telegram channel, Zelenskyy responded to the fake video by saying: "We are defending our land, our children, our families. So we don't plan to lay down any arms. Until our victory."
- The message was not just displayed across social media, however. It also appeared briefly on television in Ukraine and on a news broadcaster's website.
- The national television station Ukraine 24 confirmed that hackers managed to send the fake Zelenskyy message across live television on the scrolling-text news crawl known as "the ticker," and the video showed up briefly on the news station's website. It was the work of "enemy hackers," the station said.
- The messages the hackers managed to broadcast through Ukraine 24 urged Ukrainians to stop fighting and give up their weapons. They also falsely stated that Zelenskyy had fled Kyiv, according to the Atlantic Council's Eurasia researcher Roman Osadchuk.
- The messages were amplified on VKontakte, the social network comparable to Facebook that is popular in Russia and controlled by allies of the Kremlin, Osadchuk noted.
- Researchers said that despite the deepfake not being particularly sophisticated, it should still be considered dangerous.
- "The deepfake is not very well done," said Sam Gregory of the human rights group Witness, which specializes in detecting inauthentic media in crises.
- He said the Ukrainian government getting out in front of the deepfake by warning about manipulated videos weeks before this one was released, as well as Zelenskyy himself quickly saying it was a fake, helped slow its spread in the West, but it is possible that lower-quality versions of the video could take on a life of their own in other parts of the world.
- "If you look at other contexts globally where the deepfake is poor quality, or of good enough quality to create room for doubt, and it's not so easy to challenge it directly," Gregory said.
- Furthermore, the video, regardless of where it came from and its quality, could potentially make some people question the veracity of videos of Zelenskyy in the future, researchers said.
- "The particular issue is also around the so-called liar's dividend, where it's easy to claim a true video is falsified and place the onus on people to prove it's authentic," Gregory said.
- Farid added: "It pollutes the information ecosystem, and it casts a shadow on all content, which is already dealing with the complex fog of war," he said. "The next time the president goes on television, some people might think, 'Wait a minute — is this real?' "
- A Twitter spokeswoman said the company will allow the video in instances where it was shared to expose it as a fake. But if the video is being posted to deceive people, it will be taken down, the company said.

- Facebook has removed a deepfake video on its platform that claimed to show Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky urging his country’s troops to surrender to the invading Russian forces.
- Nathaniel Gleicher, head of security policy at Meta, Facebook’s parent company, tweeted on Wednesday that the video was removed for violating the company’s policy against misleading manipulated media.
- “Earlier today, our teams identified and removed a deepfake video claiming to show President Zelensky issuing a statement he never did. It appeared on a reportedly compromised website and then started showing across the internet,” Mr Gleicher noted.
- “We’ve quickly reviewed and removed this video for violating our policy against misleading manipulated media, and notified our peers at other platforms,” he added.
- The deepfake video appeared on the website for Segodnya, a Russian-language Ukrainian tabloid newspaper, with the text claiming that Mr Zelensky had ordered his troops to stand down.
- Segodnya responded in a statement on Instagram that “enemy hackers” were responsible for the hacking.
- The altered video was aired in a hacked news broadcast on the television channel Ukraine 24, the statement noted.
- “Friends, we have repeatedly warned about this. Nobody is going to give up. Especially in conditions when the Russian army is defeated in battles with the Ukrainian army!” Segodnya wrote.
- The real Mr Zelensky quickly responded in a separate video, instead calling the Russian forces to surrender.
- Ukrainians also reportedly ridiculed the deepfake for the poor quality of its video and audio.
- “If I can offer someone to lay down their arms, it’s the Russian military. Go home. Because we’re home. We are defending our land, our children, and our families,” the Ukrainian president said in the video.
- “We are not going to lay down any weapons until our victory,” Mr Zelensky said in a post shared on his Telegram account, calling the deepfake a “childish provocation”.
- Despite its poor quality, experts say the altered video could be the first high-level deepfake used in the Ukraine conflict, which began with Russia’s invasion of the country on 24 February.
- Ukrainian officials said since the beginning of the war, at least 1,300 of its troops have been killed.
- As of Monday, the United Nations has confirmed 636 civilian deaths in Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion, of which 46 were children and 590 were adults.
- However, the true figures are expected to be far higher with no sign of the war coming to an end.

- Twitter hasn't bothered putting a manipulated media label on the video.
- A deepfake video of Volodymyr Zelensky, president of Ukraine, was published on Twitter early this morning. At the time of this writing — approximately six hours after the video’s posting — it has accumulated more than 2,000 likes and nearly 1,000 retweets; it’s been viewed about 90,000 times.
- The account that posted the deepfake seems not to belong to the person that created the video, as the same account replied to the original tweet with commentary on just how unrealistic the deepfake is. That reply tweet (as translated from Ukrainian to English by Google Translate) comments on the mismatched skin tone, uneven pixel density, proportions of the head and body, and the voice as obvious signs that the video has been digitally altered.
- While the video is, indeed, of relatively low quality, it’s alarming that the video has been allowed to live on Twitter for as long as it has. No manipulated media label has been applied. Satirical or not, the tweet could easily mislead viewers into believing this is actually an announcement from the Ukrainian president.
- Bad, but good enough — As far as contemporary deepfakes go, the quality of this one is really very shoddy. Those on the lookout for such fakes won’t have much trouble discerning that this is not, in fact, Zelensky. The technology for really convincing deepfakes has improved massively over the last year or so — just take a look at this Tom Cruise deepfake, for example.
- Even poorly made deepfakes are dangerous, though. People are generally not very good at identifying deepfakes. Many internet users are willing to trust that a video of a public figure is actually that public figure without further investigation.
- It stands to reason that, satirical caption or not, this deepfake will be taken out of context. And we’re not just talking about any public figure here. This is the leader of a country that is currently being invaded supposedly asking to retreat and surrender. It’s a situation with mortal consequences.
- Twitter's dropping the ball — Creating war-bound deepfakes is one thing; allowing them to be shared across your platform is another entirely. Twitter should have already taken action on this video, either by slapping a label on it or taking the tweet down entirely.
- Way back in February 2020, Twitter instituted a stricter policy around manipulated media. The outcome of that policy depends greatly on whether or not the content is likely to “impact public safety or cause serious harm.” Given that we are talking about a political leader trapped in the middle of a deadly war, the answer to this question seems apparent.
- Without labelling this as manipulated media, the deepfake video can be re-shared across Twitter without any indication of its context. Some viewers will undoubtedly take deepfake-Zelensky’s statement here as truth.

- A faked video of the Ukrainian president telling people to surrender is being shared online.
- The video shows what appears to be Volodymyr Zelenskyy standing behind a podium saying: "It turned out to be not so easy being the president."
- He goes on to declare that he has "decided to return Donbas" in eastern Ukraine to Russia and that his army's efforts in the war "have failed".
- The short message ends with: "My advice to you is to lay down arms and return to your families. It is not worth it dying in this war. My advice to you is to live. I am going to do the same."
- But the video is a deepfake, and it is easy to spot.
- A deepfake usually involves an image or video in which a person or object is visually or audibly manipulated to say and do something that is fabricated.
- In the clip being shared online, President Zelenskyy's head is too big for the body it has been digitally attached to. It is also lit differently and sits at an awkward angle.

- You can also see a higher level of pixelation around the fake Zelenskyy's head compared to its body.
- A translator working for Sky News said that the voice in the fake video was deeper and slower than Mr Zelenskyy's normal voice.
- The real Zelenskyy later issued his own comment on the deepfake on his official Instagram account.
- In it he said: "Good day. As for the latest childish provocation with advice to lay down arms, I only advise that the troops of the Russian Federation lay down their arms and return home.
- "We are already home, we are defending our land, our children, our families. So, we are not going to lay down any arms until our victory."
- The selfie-style real presidential video was posted with the message: "We are at home and defending Ukraine."
- The deepfake video seems to have been broadcast with a written message on TV24, a Ukrainian TV channel which was reportedly hacked.
- An archived version of the news site shows the message was live on the site on Wednesday.
- Earlier this month, the Ukrainian Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security issued a warning on Facebook about deepfakes of the president.
- It said: "Imagine seeing Vladimir Zelensky on TV making a surrender statement. You see it, you hear it - so it’s true. But this is not the truth. This is deepfake technology.
- "This will not be a real video, but created through machine learning algorithms."

- Professor Sandra Wachter, an expert on law and ethics of AI, Big Data and robotics at the University of Oxford, told Sky News: "Spreading wrong or misleading information about political leaders is as old as humanity itself."
- She added: "We now have technology that can fake pictures, video and audio, and that we have the Internet where such information can spread more widely which makes it distinct from historical examples.
- "Luckily, the technology is not yet advanced enough to create a fake that is undetectable. In the clip of Zelenskyy being circulated, there are clearly facial 'artifacts' (visible traces in the image left behind through the process of distorting the clip) as well as audio and scaling issues. Yet, as always technology is evolving fast and we must not sleepwalk into the situation."
