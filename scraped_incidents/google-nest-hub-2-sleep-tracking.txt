- The success of Google's new Nest Hub smart device will likely depend on whether people trust Google enough to let the company monitor them whilst they are asleep, according to the AP.
- Many reviewers praise the product's basic functions, usability, and sleep monitoring capabilities.
- Some commentators, however, question the accuracy of Google's sleep sensing and analytics. Others highlight Google's rapacious quest for user data, and wonder what the company might do with it - now, and in the future.
- Optional for now, it appears Google is looking to charge for the service going forward. The company says none of the data collected through Nest Hub's sleep sensing feature will be used to sell personalised advertising.

- SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) — Google’s next internet-connected home device will test whether consumers trust the company enough to let it snoop on their sleep.
- New sleep-sensing technology will be a key feature on Google’s latest version of its Nest Hub, a 7-inch smart screen unveiled Tuesday. Like the previous generation, the $100 Nest Hub can display pictures and video in addition to fielding questions and handling household tasks through Google’s voice-activated assistant. It also doesn’t feature a camera.
- But the latest Nest Hub’s new trick may help differentiate it from similar devices, such as Amazon’s Echo Show, while also providing a springboard for Google to get more involved in helping people manage their health.
- If you allow it, the device will also monitor your sleeping patterns from your bedside, negating the need to wear a fitness device or any other potentially bothersome gadget in bed. The feature, which Google intends to offer for free through at least this year, relies on a new chip Google calls Soli, which uses radar to detect motion, including the depth of a person’s breathing.
- The Nest Hub is supposed to generate weekly sleep reports with easy-to-understand breakdowns on the length and quality of sleep, how frequently the user gets up at night and snoring and coughing frequency, along with tips developed in consultation with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
- Google says it honed the technology by studying 15,000 sleeping people over a combined 110,000 nights.
- That kind of help may sound appealing to the millions of people who have trouble sleeping. But the feature may also raise privacy concerns — especially given Google’s long history of online surveillance to collect personal details such as interests, habits and whereabouts to help sell the digital ads that generate most of its revenue.
- It also underscores Google’s obvious intent to extend its tentacles into new areas of people’s lives in its relentless quest to make more money, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a consumer and privacy rights group.
- “Google’s goal is to monetize every cell of your body,” Chester said.
- The sleep sensing feature will remain free through the rest of this year, but Google could eventually sell it as a subscription service, acknowledged Ashton Udall, Google Nest’s senior product manager.
- The company may also eventually tweak the feature to work with its FitBit line of fitness devices, which Google took over in January. That $2.1 billion purchase has raised concerns that Google could use those gadgets to peer more deeply into people’s personal health.
- Google is emphasizing the privacy protections built into the sleep sensing feature. For starters, users will have to turn it on themselves. The Nest Hub will also have controls that Google says will make it clear when sleep tracking is on and to make it easy to delete data from the device.
- All audio will be kept on the device, meaning it won’t be sent to Google’s data centers, although other sleep information will be provided to generate the analysis and reports. None of the information collected through the sleep sensing feature will be used to sell ads, Udall said.
- But Chester is skeptical about that pledge. Knowing an individual’s sleeping patterns, for instance, could help Google know when a person is feeling anxious or sick, Chester said, and those insights could influence which ads to show.

- Google is the lasted tech company to expand into the health market with a new Nest Hub assistant that monitors sleep.
- The seven-inch smart screen is packed with sleep-sensing technology that collects data while sitting at the owner's bedside.
- The feature, which Google intends to offer for free through at least this year, relies on a new chip Google calls Soli, which uses radar to detect motion, including the depth of a person's breathing.
- The data collected can be used to understand sleeping patters and how they change overtime, along with making suggestions on how it can be approved - such as recommending a certain time to crawl into bed.
- The new Nest Hub is available for $100, which displays pictures and video and users can access Google's voice-activated assistant for household tasks.

- But the latest Nest Hub's new trick may help differentiate from similar devices, such as Amazon's Echo Show, while also providing a springboard for Google to get more involved in helping people manage their help.
- It also offers a contactless approach compared to other companies like Apple and Garmin that already feature the option, but users need to operated a Smart Watch and app to make it work.

- The new Google Nest Hub will track users' body activity in bed to generate personalised sleep-tracking reports.
- The device's radar-based scanning technology detects movement, including coughing and snoring, as well as light and temperature changes.
- But the new features have been criticised for collecting data when users are "most vulnerable".
- And Privacy is Power author Carissa Véliz asked: “What happens when you have sex?"
- Google said the new features had been "built with privacy in mind” - and the data collected would not be used to create personalised advertising.
- Owners can also choose to disable motion tracking and the microphone - and delete any stored data.
- Any information gathered - through movement or audio - is processed locally on the device, but anonymous "sleep event data" is stored on Google's cloud server.
- This includes bedtimes, waketimes, coughing and restfulness.
- 'Spied on'
- But Véliz said: “There are many questions that arise.
- "What will happen to data about your sleep quality?
- "Might it end up in the hands of an insurance company?”
- “Google gets most of its revenue from the exploitation of personal data.
- This video can not be played
- The Google chip that lets users make tiny hand gestures to control devices
- “Whenever it comes up with a new product, it would be near-sighted to think about it as a product designed for its users.
- “It’s only designed for its users to the extent that it can convince people to use the product so that Google can get more data on us.
- “Not only are we being heard, tracked, and spied on through our screens, now our bodies will be scanned by Soli.”
- Google’s Soli radar was first used to allow Pixel 4 smartphone users to silence calls and pause or skip music tracks by gesturing in the air with their fingers - but it was removed from the Pixel 5 to reduce costs.
- And Nest 2 users will be able to use it to activate functions such as snoozing an alarm.
- But it will also collect data to generate personalised sleeping tips and schedules, initially as a “free preview”, although Google said it could charge a subscription fee in future.
- In 2019, Pixel product manager Brandon Barbello told The Verge the technology "can sense motion as precise as a butterfly's wings".
- And a research paper said it could be used to track individual finger movements with "sub-millimetre accuracy".
- However, Ars Technica reported the version in this device is limited to detecting "big, arm-waving gestures".
- Radical Rest author Richard Lister said: "Tech that actively scans movement is not something I feel is useful.
- "Our minds look for threat - and being watched while we sleep is a primal one.
- "This does not feel safe for me, especially when the levels of anxiety in the current population are heightened."
- Non-invasive technology, such as watches or rings, could be more helpful to monitor sleep, he added.
- But Nest senior product manager Ashton Udall blogged: “We wanted to offer an alternative way for people who may not want to wear something to bed to understand their sleep.
- “A lack of sleep can negatively affect mood, energy, stress, diet, productivity... the list goes on and on.”
- Google also said it was aiming to integrate the Nest Hub’s Sleep Sensing features and Fitbit's sleep analytics, having bought the fitness-tracking company last year.
- The Nest 2, priced at £89.99, device also features a display that adjusts to the brightness of the room and allows users to play videos.
- Its screen can act as a digital photo frame.
- And as one of Google’s oldest smart-home devices, first launched in 2018, the Nest Hub is compatible with many other connected smart devices, including lights and thermostats.

- Google has announced a sequel to the Nest Hub (formerly the Google Home Hub): the "second-generation" Nest Hub. It looks exactly like the existing Nest Hub—with the same design and 7-inch display—but with better sound and a few extra sensors. The headline feature is the inclusion of Google's Soli Radar technology, which enables air gestures and sleep tracking.
- Like the other second-gen Nest Audio speakers, the Nest Hub 2 has better sound. "The new Nest Hub's speaker is based on the same audio technology as Nest Audio," Google's blog post says, "and has 50 percent more bass than the original Hub." Also like the second-gen speaker hardware, the new Hub comes with "a dedicated on-device machine-learning chip which moves some Assistant experiences from our data centers directly onto the device, so responses to common commands become faster over time." Google notes that the on-device ML is available in the US only.
- Soli is the main new addition. Google's in-house chip was previously included on (and then removed from) the Pixel line. The technology is interesting: Google miniaturized radar into a chip small enough that it could be shoved into an electronic device. The early demos promised to capture "sub-millimeter motions of your fingers," allowing for gestures like spinning a virtual dial or tapping a button. In the path to commercialization, Google had to cut down these lab prototypes, and now Soli can only detect big, arm-waving gestures, which are a lot less useful. Soli was a flop on the Pixel 4 because it offered inaccurate gestures that didn't provide much value compared to the giant touchscreen on a phone, which had clear labels and better accuracy.
- Google seems to be porting the feature over to the Nest Hub, unimproved, with "Quick Gestures." The only gesture mentioned is a big, hand-up "stop" gesture that you can do a few inches in front of the screen. This gesture will play or pause content, snooze an alarm, and stop a timer. Like on the Pixel 4, there's also a huge, more accurate touch button on the screen when any of this is happening, so you'll probably be hard-pressed to pick the air gesture over the screen tap. I could see air gestures being useful if you're cooking and have dirty hands (smart displays are popular in the kitchen, after all), but remember these devices also have Google Assistant voice commands, which can start and stop music as well as a bunch of other things hands-free, without the range limitations of Soli.
- The Nest Hub 2 doesn't have a camera, but it does want to watch you while you sleep via Soli's radar. The new "sleep sensing" feature will "analyze how the person closest to the display is sleeping, based on their movement and breathing—all without a camera or wearable." You'll be gently caressed by radar waves as you sleep for movement detection, the microphone can detect coughing or snoring, and the ambient light and temperature sensors can track what's happening in the room. In the morning, you'll know whether or not you should feel tired (I guess?) via a sleep summary that will be shown on the Nest Hub display. Sleep sensing can also connect to the Google Fit app on a smartphone and share data with it.
- The wearables shoutout is interesting, since most tech companies would do sleep tracking via a wearable, but the terrible performance of Wear OS in the marketplace means Google doesn't have a viable wearable platform. Google is currently undergoing a rework of its wearables strategy after buying Fitbit, and this blog post says, "We'll also be looking for ways to work with Fitbit's sleep-tracking features in the future."
- Google notes that sleep sensing is optional and that "your coughing and snoring audio data is only processed on the device—it isn't sent to Google servers." For now, sleep sensing is "a preview," and it sounds like Google is planning to charge extra for the service sometime next year.
- Here's the relevant quote from the support page:
- Enjoy a preview of Sleep Sensing for free until next year. Google is learning and innovating on this new technology, and also exploring how Sleep Sensing can become a part of the Fitbit and Fitbit Premium experiences. Google and Fitbit will keep you updated on any future plans related to Sleep Sensing.
- Fitbit Premium—a service currently undergoing upheaval along with everything else at Fitbit—is $10 per month.
- The new Nest Hub also features the new smart home standard, "Project Connected Home over IP" or "Project CHIP." CHIP is a conglomerate of heavy hitters—Google, Apple, Amazon, Zigbee, and others—that finally want to figure out smart home standards once and for all with a new, additional standard (feel free to link that XKCD comic in the comments). The Nest Hub already has a ton of smart home controls, but it relies on your existing smart home hub bridging commands and data over to Wi-Fi and the Google Assistant. With a built-in Thread radio (one of the IoT communication protocols for CHIP), it could theoretically be a more active part of a smart home network or possibly replace your hub.
- The CHIP standard isn't done yet, so it's not clear exactly what Google is planning here. Google has integrated smart home hardware into devices before, like the Google OnHub router, which also came with a Thread radio. Absolutely nothing became of the OnHub's secret smart home functionality, so we're not holding our breath for something to happen here. Google’s follow-ups to the OnHub (the Google Wi-Fi and Google Nest Wi-Fi) can also join Thread networks, but there's no reason why you would want to do that. Currently, the Google Assistant's "Actions" API makes it fantastic for smart home voice control, so it's not clear what bringing any of that on board would actually accomplish from a consumer perspective.
- The second-gen Nest Hub is up for preorder now on the Google Store for $99.99. It looks like it ships around March 30.

- "So how did you sleep last night?"
- When that question came up in our bedroom, it was always between my wife, Sally, and me. But one weekend not long ago we made it a threesome, thanks to the newest Google Nest Hub smart speaker.  The Google Nest Hub is a $99 smart speaker with a 7-inch touch screen that doesn't look much different from its predecessor, also called the Google Nest Hub.  But this second-generation model includes a new feature—touch-free sleep tracking—that all but demands that you put it in the bedroom instead of on the kitchen counter, where most smart speakers with screens have resided.
- And so, in addition to the usual smart speaker testing performed in our labs, we took a look at the Nest Hub's sleep-tracking function to see how it compared with that on wearable devices like the Apple Watch and Oura Ring.
- At the heart of the Nest Hub's sleep tracking is a proprietary Soli sensor that Google describes as "miniature radar." Originally designed for gesture recognition in Pixel smartphones, wearables, and other devices, this motion sensor is sophisticated enough to record the nighttime activity of a single person, excluding movements from a partner. The Nest uses other sensors as well.
- "Sleep Sensing uses Motion Sense to track the sleep of the person closest to the display,” according to the company’s website. It combines “low-energy radar to detect movement and breathing,” with sensors that “detect sounds, like snoring and coughing, and environmental factors, like light and temperature in the room."
- It's important to recognize that sleep trackers don't actually measure sleep directly. That requires a gold standard test called polysomnography, which is administered by a technician in a sleep lab and uses a variety of sensors, including one to measure EEG brain waves.
- Instead, consumer-grade sleep trackers measure parameters that are typical of sleep, notably movement (or lack thereof). The devices you wear on your wrist, finger, or forehead often add measurements like pulse rate and blood-oxygen-level readings to help refine their findings.  But the Nest Hub is supposed to allow you to track your sleep unencumbered by straps and bands. The sleep data it collects, which includes everything from your total sleep time to the number of times you coughed, can be seen on the device itself and, in greater detail, on the Google Fit app. The Nest Hub also graphs your sleep time by the week or the month to help reveal trends.
- Google adds the blanket disclaimer that the Nest Hub is not a medical device for diagnosis of sleep disorders. That's true of the consumer-grade wearables as well.
- At first glance, the Nest Hub is a pretty conventional smart speaker with a screen. The smallish touch screen can be set to display a smart speaker menu, clock, or gallery of images, acting as a digital picture frame.
- Like most smart screens, it can also play video, and it's especially adept at serving up content from Google-owned YouTube. It's not like watching on a 65-inch OLED but is more gratifying than your phone, especially when you're close to the screen.
- The Nest Hub, which is powered by Google Assistant, can also control smart home devices like a Nest thermostat or smart bulbs, although I didn't try those functions.
- The speaker features a smart-alarm function that can be set with a weekly schedule and a wake function, called Sunrise Alarm, that gradually increases the brightness of the display when it's almost time to get up. It offers a wide variety of wake sounds, many with a spalike vibe designed to rouse you gently.
- Before you use it, the Nest Hub needs to be set up on your nightstand or another mattress-level surface near the head of your bed. The relatively quick process requires you to lie still in bed for a few minutes while the Soli sensor does its thing.
- For the best results, Google suggests you remove any objects between you and the speaker. And once it's positioned, the Nest Hub shouldn't be moved.
- Having a smart speaker in your bedroom prompts some privacy concerns. The Nest Hub doesn't have a camera, which addresses one issue (though you can't make video calls). The mic can also be turned off with a switch on the back.
- With a notice on the screen, the device does make it clear to you—or a partner or guest—when it's in Sleep Sensing mode. However, once you turn on Sleep Sensing and log in to the Google Fit smartphone app, the Nest Hub will keep recording your sleep data and sending it to Google.
- The raw sound data—breathing, coughing, etc.—as well as movement information from the Soli sensor is, according to Google, processed within the device and not sent to Google's cloud servers, where most Google Assistant requests are processed.
- "Devices that sense your activity in the background raise many privacy concerns," says David Choffnes, a smart speaker researcher and associate professor at Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Science.
- "If what Google is saying is correct, it is good for privacy that they are not transmitting audio of breathing or coughing to their cloud," he says. "However, even the inferred data about sleep and health is highly sensitive, and the privacy implications of collecting this data are not addressed by simply not transmitting audio."
- Choffnes adds that his lab would need to run experiments on the Nest Hub to determine the validity of Google's privacy claim.
- I found it can take more than an hour in the morning for the Nest Hub to process the results from the night before, which eliminates the instant gratification factor that wearable sleep trackers can provide.
- I used the sleep tracker on the Nest Hub for five consecutive nights and got mixed results.
- The first night was fine, with the device recording around 7 hours of sleep, which basically agreed with both my subjective evaluation—I woke up without my alarm and felt generally well-rested—as well as the results from the sleep tracking function on my Oura Ring.
- On some subsequent nights, the Nest Hub seemed to either over- or underreport my sleep. On the second morning, when I brought my laptop back to bed and started working on a news article while still in my pj's, it added an hour to my sleep duration.
- The following night, when I was watching the Tom Hanks movie "News of the World" with my wife, the Nest Hub again seemed to think I was sleeping.
- In the morning, the Nest Hub reported that I had slept 11 hours and 17 minutes, although when I later checked the "processed data" on the Google Fit app, my sleep time was revised downward to a more plausible 7 hours and 48 minutes.
- Another night, the Nest Hub logged more than 2 hours less sleep time than my Oura ring.
- In its product literature, Google warns that "device placement and nearby people, pets, or noises can cause inaccurate readings." So it's entirely possible that my golden retriever Rugby is to blame for some of the odd results. (She sometimes snores.)
- "Minor differences between sleep trackers are common and don’t reflect any accuracy problem with either device," says Ashton Udall, senior product manager for Google Nest. "The most important thing about sleep tracking . . . is monitoring changes over time and how those relate to how you’re feeling."
- And the variations come as no surprise to sleep experts who explain that all consumer-grade sleep trackers have limitations when it comes to accuracy.
- "All of these devices have constraints, and weaknesses. None of them are perfect," says Michael Grandner, director of the Sleep & Health Research Program at the University of Arizona School of Medicine. "The question isn't whether it's accurate, the question is 'How is it inaccurate, and how do you interpret that information?' "
- With new devices using new technology, like the Nest Hub, consumers should be careful not to take the results too literally, Grandner says.  My experience with the Nest Hub was admittedly limited; five nights is a small sample. Going forward, I could change certain practices to reduce discrepancies—watching TV downstairs or working in my office—or just learn to treat those unusual results as outliers.
- A month's worth of information from the Nest Hub, which can be found both on the device and in more granular form on the Google Fit app, would probably allow me to draw inferences about how much sleep I'm getting and what factors affect that.
- In short, the Nest Hub is easier to use than a wearable, and though its sleep tracking information isn't perfect, it's probably useful if your goal is simply to understand and improve your sleep habits.
- As with its sonically similar predecessor, the Nest Hub's sound leaves quite a bit to be desired. Our testers report that there's not much deep bass, and the highs are a bit thin and sizzly.
- Worse yet, the all-important-midrange, where most voices and instruments live, delivered all sorts of distortions. "Thin, raspy, plasticky, and hazy" are some of the less-than-complimentary adjectives our testers used to describe the speaker's audio quality.   In the end, it falls short of what you get from the latest version of the Amazon Echo Show 8, which is similar in size and price but much more pleasant to listen to.
- The ease of use and versatility scores, however, are a different story. As with most smart speakers with screens, the Nest Hub was simple to set up, although our testers noted that some of the controls—including the microphone mute—are not as obvious or well-marked as they could be.
- The speaker's versatility is another strong point. The Nest Hub can work as part of a multiroom system with other Google devices, although it can't be paired in stereo with another unit. Our testers note that the newest Nest Hub supports calling and messaging but not texting. It lacks speakerphone capability, too.
- Does the new Google Nest Hub deserve a spot on your bedside table? The device offers an impressive amount of technology for less than $100, only $10 more than the first-gen model. It pairs the do-what-I-say functionality of a smart speaker with some cool tricks from a tablet or smart frame. And in that way, the model should merit serious consideration for a spot on your kitchen island or even your desk.
- Our testers find the model to be versatile and easy to use, but the below-average sound quality makes it better suited for podcasts and weather forecasts than listening to music.
- Sharing your bedroom with the Nest Hub? That's a more personal question. The sleep tracking functionality is pretty impressive even if its conclusions don't completely jibe with a wearable unit. But in order to pull off the sleep tracking feature, the Nest Hub essentially listens to every breath you take as if it's a "Hey, Google" wake word and records you all night long.  As my wife, Sally, said when I explained how the Nest Hub works, "That's kind of creepy." But, of course, your reactions may vary.
- So while I'll probably miss the Nest Hub's retro-cool flip clock display, I think I'll go back to answering the question "So how'd you sleep?" with words instead of data, and make my bedroom a smart-speaker-free zone again.

- I believe that technology has the power to change our lives—for better or for worse. That's why I’ve spent my life reporting and writing about it for outlets of all sorts, from newspapers (such as the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times) to magazines (Popular Mechanics and Rolling Stone) and even my own books ("Newton’s Football" and "Clapton’s Guitar"). For me, there's no better way to spend a day than talking to a bunch of experts about an important subject and then writing a story that'll help others be smarter and better informed.
