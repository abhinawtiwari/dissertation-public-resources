- Launched in February 2016, FindFace is a facial recognition tool developed by Russian technology company NtechLab that analysed an image of a person and matched it to their account on Russian social network VKontakte.
- Initially billed as a dating site, FindFace was later re-developed as a surveillance tool for government and business.
- FaceApp was the first app to raise significant alarm about the power of facial recognition used at scale. The app boasted 70% accuracy, a rate of success was verified by a Russian artist who tested it out by taking photos of people sitting across from him on the subway.
- NtechLab had previously won the MegaFace Challenge, in which facial recognition teams were encouraged to download a database of facial images and see how their algorithms performed when they had to distinguish between a million possible matches.
- FindFace garnered controversy as Russian imageboard 2chan used it to deanonymise and harass Russian porn actresses and alleged prostitutes, and spam their friends and families with news of their discovery.
- According to a GlobalVoices report, participants of the campaign were motivated by moral outrage towards an industry they viewed as 'corrupt and deceptive.'
- FaceApp founders told The Guardian the tool was primarily a promotional tool for its facial recognition technology, with the real money likely to come from law enforcement and retail.
- NtechLab is known to have helped power Buenos Aires' Fugitive Facial Recognition System (Sistema de Reconocimiento Facial de Prófugos (SNRP)), and develop Russian ethnicity identification capabilities.
- It also helped set up the Moscow Metro's facial recognition-based Face Pay system.

- FindFace compares photos to profile pictures on social network Vkontakte and works out identities with 70% reliability
- If the founders of a new face recognition app get their way, anonymity in public could soon be a thing of the past. FindFace, launched two months ago and currently taking Russia by storm, allows users to photograph people in a crowd and work out their identities, with 70% reliability.
- It works by comparing photographs to profile pictures on Vkontakte, a social network popular in Russia and the former Soviet Union, with more than 200 million accounts. In future, the designers imagine a world where people walking past you on the street could find your social network profile by sneaking a photograph of you, and shops, advertisers and the police could pick your face out of crowds and track you down via social networks.
- In the short time since the launch, Findface has amassed 500,000 users and processed nearly 3m searches, according to its founders, 26-year-old Artem Kukharenko, and 29-year-old Alexander Kabakov.
- Kukharenko is a lanky, quietly spoken computer nerd who has come up with the algorithm that makes FindFace such an impressive piece of technology, while Kabakov is the garrulous money and marketing man, who does all of the talking when the pair meet the Guardian.
- Unlike other face recognition technology, their algorithm allows quick searches in big data sets. “Three million searches in a database of nearly 1bn photographs: that’s hundreds of trillions of comparisons, and all on four normal servers. With this algorithm, you can search through a billion photographs in less than a second from a normal computer,” said Kabakov, during an interview at the company’s modest central Moscow office. The app will give you the most likely match to the face that is uploaded, as well as 10 people it thinks look similar.
- Kabakov says the app could revolutionise dating: “If you see someone you like, you can photograph them, find their identity, and then send them a friend request.” The interaction doesn’t always have to involve the rather creepy opening gambit of clandestine street photography, he added: “It also looks for similar people. So you could just upload a photo of a movie star you like, or your ex, and then find 10 girls who look similar to her and send them messages.”
- Some have sounded the alarm about the potentially disturbing implications. Already the app has been used by a St Petersburg photographer to snap and identify people on the city’s metro, as well as by online vigilantes to uncover the social media profiles of female porn actors and harass them.
- The technology can work with any photographic database, though it currently cannot use Facebook, because even the public photographs are stored in a way that is harder to access than Vkontakte, the app’s creators say.
- But the FindFace app is really just a shop window for the technology, the founders said. There is a paid function for those who want to make more than 30 searches a month, but this is more to regulate the servers from overload rather than to make money. They believe the real money-spinner from their face-recognition technology will come from law enforcement and retail.
- Kukharenko and Kabakov have recently returned from the US, and Kabakov was due to travel to Macau and present the technology to a casino chain. The pair claim they have been contacted by police in Russian regions, who told them they started loading suspect or witness photographs into FindFace and came up with results. “It’s nuts: there were cases that had seen no movement for years, and now they are being solved,” said Kabakov.
- The startup is in the final stages of signing a contract with Moscow city government to work with the city’s network of 150,000 CCTV cameras. If a crime is committed, the mugshots of anyone in the area can be fed into the system and matched with photographs of wanted lists, court records, and even social networks.
- It does not take a wild imagination to come up with sinister applications in this field too; for example authoritarian regimes able to tag and identify participants in street protests. Kabakov and Kukharenko said they had not received an approach from Russia’s FSB security service, but “if the FSB were to get in touch, of course we’d listen to any offers they had”.
- The pair also have big plans for the retail sector. Kabakov imagines a world where cameras fix you looking at, say, a stereo in a shop, the retailer finds your identity, and then targets you with marketing for stereos in the subsequent days.
- Again, it sounds a little disturbing. But Kabakov said, as a philosophy graduate, he believes we cannot stop technological progress so must work with it and make sure it stays open and transparent.
- “In today’s world we are surrounded by gadgets. Our phones, televisions, fridges, everything around us is sending real-time information about us. Already we have full data on people’s movements, their interests and so on. A person should understand that in the modern world he is under the spotlight of technology. You just have to live with that.”

- This article was published more than 7 years ago
- In “The Dark Knight,” the seminal reboot of the “Batman” cinematic franchise, the Caped Crusader is able to locate any of Gotham’s denizens on a whim, by hijacking the microphones and cameras on their cellphones. FindFace, the identification app created by Alexander Kabakov, 29, and Artem Kukharenko, 26, is not quite as powerful as Christopher Nolan’s Orwellian nightmare tool. But the Russian developers say their facial recognition software could be used by authorities to fight crime — and, just as easily, score dates with attractive strangers.
- (Or, at least, score the attractive strangers’ names.)
- FindFace can identify random passersby with about 70 percent accuracy, given two conditions: You need to snap a photo of them, and they need to have a social media profile.
- “If you see someone you like, you can photograph them, find their identity, and then send them a friend request,” Kabakov told the Guardian in an interview on Tuesday. Alternatively, he said, you can run a photo of an ex or celebrity through the program, and FindFace will spit out the social media profiles of similar-looking people.
- FindFace marries a powerful facial-recognition algorithm to a popular social media website, VK. Previously known as VKontakte, VK is the dominant social network in eastern Europe, especially among those who speak Russian. The “Russian Facebook” boasts some 200 million accounts, and Vk.com is the third most visited website in Russia, according to website ranker Alexa. (The individuals being identified must have a VK account, as FindFace is not currently compatible with the way Facebook inventories its images.)
- Skipping church? Facial recognition software could be tracking you
- The algorithm comes from Moscow-based NTechLab, which recently boasted it bested Google’s recognition software at MegaFace, a technical challenge hosted by the University of Washington. Scanning 1 million faces, the NTechLab correctly identified 73 percent of people in the set. NTechLab’s software, like many facial recognition systems, uses an artificial neural network — a system that apes the biological connections between neurons to efficiently perform a task.
- “With this algorithm, you can search through a billion photographs in less than a second from a normal computer,” Kabakov told the Guardian.
- Since it launched in February, FindFace has been downloaded 500,000 times, Kabakov and Kukharenko said. In total, users have sent about 3 million images through a FindFace search.
- Bold are FindFace’s claims, but they appear to be borne out in some independent assessments, as at least one Russian photographer found. FindFace and NTechLab have not responded to The Washington Post’s requests for comment.
- The editorial team at Kaspersky, a Russian software security company, found themselves via FindFace in April: “The program has successfully found 9 of 10 test ‘victims’ in the office,” according to the Kaspersky blog. People with VK profiles may wish to delete old profile photos from VK, Kaspersky says, or hold their heads in strange poses to confuse the software. (Some of the cheekier responses to facial-recognition-as-surveillance-tools include the Pixelhead mask, a ski mask-type hat that obscures your features as though your face had been digitally erased out of real life.)
- Kabakov told the Guardian that Russian police officers have used FindFace to solve crimes, for which there were photographs or closed-circuit footage. “It’s nuts: there were cases that had seen no movement for years, and now they are being solved,” he said.
- Facial recognition technology is everywhere. It may not be legal.
- Facial recognition software has improved dramatically over the past few decades, though algorithms can still fall short if, say, both eyes — often used as reference points — aren’t visible. Facebook says its DeepFace can tell 97 times out of 100 if two photographs contain the same person. Some of Facebook’s experimental systems don’t even require faces. “For example, you can recognize Mark Zuckerberg very easily, because he always wears a gray T-shirt,” Yann LeCun an artificial intelligence expert at Facebook told New Scientist in June of last year.
- When asked by the Guardian if FindFace’s creators were concerned with invasion of privacy or the loss of anonymity, Kabakov argued the march of technological progress was inevitable. “A person should understand that in the modern world he is under the spotlight of technology,” he said. “You just have to live with that.”
- What the Guardian posed as possible hypothetical scenarios — “sinister applications” — have already happened. In April, users of the website 4chan availed themselves of FindFace, according to the website Fusion, to identify heretofore anonymous Russian pornographic actresses.

- Развитие технологий отбирает у властных структур монополию на идентификацию человека по фото/видео и передаёт эту возможность буквально любому заинтересованному. Не подозревая об этом, люди продолжают придерживаться привычных моделей поведения, закрываясь на публике и открываясь в социальных сетях. Они оставляют для незнакомцев возможность подглядывать за моментами своей жизни через интернет, и этот цифровой нарциссизм во многом определяет границы частного и публичного в наше время. Не используя настройки приватности, мы часто провоцируем сетевой сталкинг.
- В проекте YOUR FACE IS BIG DATA я фотографировал людей, сидевших передо мной в вагоне метро, а потом искал их в социальных сетях с помощью общедоступного программного обеспечения. Таким образом я узнавал многое о жизни человека, не вступая в личный контакт, и мог сопоставить реальный образ с интернет-репрезентацией.

- FindFace's technology may one day allow anyone to identify you with their phone.
- Imagine you’re sitting in a coffee shop. Out of the corner of your eye, you see a stranger pointing his phone in your direction. The next day, you get an email from someone claiming to have seen you at the coffee shop. He’s asking you on a date. You have no idea how he got your contact information, let alone how he identified you.
- The power to identify total strangers on the street is the advertising pitch for a new wave of startups hoping to capitalize on rapidly advancing facial recognition technology. But in Russia, it’s already a reality.
- FindFace, an app launched by a Russian startup two months ago, lets its users identify strangers from pictures of their faces. It does so by matching the photos against profile pictures from VK—also known as VKontakte—a Russian social networking website similar to Facebook. Its founders have touted the app as great for building friendships or starting relationships with strangers. But the privacy risks are enormous.
- Since the launch, many news outlets have asked whether similar products are coming to the United States. But the real threat isn’t that an app like FindFace will come to a social network like Facebook. It’s that it may soon be applied to countless other databases of photos, like campus directories and employee lists—or even the entire Internet.
- * * *
- Here’s how FindFace works. First, you take a photo of someone whom you want to identify. Next, you upload the photo to the app, which searches pictures from VK and gives you back those that it thinks look similar. FindFace’s facial recognition algorithm is state-of-the-art—developed by a company called NTech Lab, it recently went toe-to-toe with Google’s facial recognition algorithm in an international competition at the University of Washington—but it isn’t anything new. Facebook does these sorts of searches on a daily basis, albeit on different datasets. The real innovation that makes FindFace such a threat to privacy is its database.
- When you upload a photo to Facebook, it compares the faces in that photo only to faces of your friends. FindFace, on the other hand, searches every profile picture from VK. This means that every time someone submits a photo to FindFace, it matches against a database containing every member of the most popular social networking site in the Russian-speaking world—hundreds of millions of accounts. And when it finds a match, it can tie that person back to a VK profile, revealing their name and contact information.
- All VK profile pictures are public, so the only way to hide from this database is to delete your profile. This leaves Russians with two undesirable options. They can either leave VK for less popular platforms, missing out on all of the updates, photos, and messages. Or they can resign themselves to the fact that their faces are indexed and searchable by the entire world.
- * * *
- Could someone do the same thing to Facebook? Probably not.
- FindFace most likely got its database of profile pictures by siphoning them out of VK—downloading them one by one either through the company’s API or by visiting every VK profile with a bot. This siphoning is a common nuisance for large websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, so these sites have banned “automated data collection” in their terms of service, strengthened privacy settings, and implemented robust anti-siphoning protections in the form of “rate-limiting.” If you try to load too many pages too quickly—if you begin to resemble a siphoner or a bot—these sites will automatically restrict or cut off your access.
- That doesn’t mean Facebook is in the clear. The site doesn’t provide a way to hide your profile from the public at large, which would be the most basic defense against the risk of a FindFace clone. At the very least, Facebook should allow you to show a different picture to people outside of your network of friends. If desired, it could also help you display this picture in low-enough resolution that facial recognition algorithms like FindFace will be stumped. Facebook could even offer to make the photo grayscale or blur it slightly, further obfuscating the information that facial recognition technology needs to operate. These features are simple adaptations of the same technology that let people overlay a French flag on their profile pictures out of solidarity with Paris after last year’s terrorist attacks.
- Facebook is uniquely positioned to provide one other powerful privacy feature. It could use its own facial-recognition capabilities to see whether anyone else’s profile pictures seem like a match for yours—whether you have Facebook doppelgangers. If you do, then an algorithm like FindFace will have a hard time pinpointing you in particular as opposed to your lookalikes. And if you really are unique, Facebook could offer to blur the photo and lower the resolution until you fade into the crowd.
- * * *
- The reason that Facebook can offer this range of privacy protections is that it is a walled garden. It controls content like profile pictures, and the only way to get them is to go through Facebook, rate-limiting and all. Unfortunately, a vast sea of images on the Internet—perhaps even the majority of them—are not under anyone’s control.
- Google your name. Look at the gallery of familiar faces staring back. Google didn’t covertly extract these pictures from Facebook. Its army of bots collected them from millions of public websites and linked them to keywords on the page, your name included. Since these bots take a little information from a lot of different places, no single website has reason to restrict these visits in the way that Facebook does siphoning. In fact, most sites actively seek out these bots to ensure that they’re searchable on Google.
- Right now, the primary way that you can search for an image is with keywords describing it. Google does allow you to search for images with other images, but it doesn’t use facial recognition to do so—you can’t search for similar faces like you can with FindFace. In fact, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt referred to facial recognition as “the only technology Google has built and, after looking at it, we decided to stop.”
- But the ability to crawl the web and amass a database of photos is not the sole province of big search engines like Google. Although mimicking FindFace on the scale of the entire Internet is probably still beyond the realm of technical feasibility for the moment, it may not be impossible for long. Facial recognition technology is improving exponentially according to experts at NIST, and storage and processing power are always getting cheaper. A startup with fewer ethical inhibitions may soon be able to write a web crawler, build a database, and unleash the Internet-wide facial recognition search that Google has thus far resisted. And once this feature becomes the next social media must-have, will companies like Google continue to hold back?
- Even if the Internet won’t turn into a giant facial-recognition database tomorrow, this technology can be applied on a smaller scale right now—in fact, it already has. In 2011, Alessandro Acquisti, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, downloaded the profile pictures of every member of the school’s network on Facebook and matched them against webcam photos of volunteers. He found that almost a third of his subjects could be identified in this manner, revealing their Facebook profiles. With today’s technology, the success rate likely would be much higher. (In the time since Acquisti’s experiment, Facebook has improved protections after several of these mass download incidents.)
- On the scale of a workplace, a college campus, or a town, apps similar to FindFace could strip away the practical anonymity we think we have in the communities we frequent on a daily basis. The sizes of these online directories and other databases are in the thousands, not the billions—a scale that might not trigger anti-siphoning measures and is well within the reach of existing facial recognition. And many of these databases are readily available. Just consider the original “facebook”—the directory of names and photos of students at a university.
- It may sound extreme, but the stark choice that VK users face now in Russia could extend to everyone with an online presence. You can’t simply delete your profile from the Internet; many photos are added by others without our knowledge or consent, down to pictures from the school science fair or neighborhood swim meet that were put online before we were old enough to intervene. These include photos on sites where we aren’t even mentioned by name.
- In this world that FindFace’s creators imagine, you could try to battle to keep your face off of the Internet, hiding from the databases that FindFace’s successors will accumulate. Or you might have to concede that you no longer have anonymity in public. You may never again be just a face in the crowd.

- The other day I went into the Banana Republic store on the Upper West Side because I saw a sign on the window advertising linen shirts. Linen shirts can’t be beat in the summer. The price on the shirts, however, turned out to be too high for an impulse buy. So, after trying a couple on, I left empty handed. Imagine my surprise when a few days later I visited the Banana Republic website and almost simultaneously received an email from the company with a special offer of 20 percent off the very shirts I had checked out a few days before.
OK, so I never got that email, and it would surprise me if the retail chain had any idea that I stopped in that night. Yet, after a meeting I had on Friday, I’m convinced now that the day will soon come when retailers know what you looked at while impulsively browsing and then re-target you with those same products on their website or over email (which is exactly what happens with digital ads right now, after you browse a company’s website). Alexander Kabakov, a co-founder of facial recognition startup, N-Tech Lab, explained for me how it all would work using his company’s unusually fast identification technologies. Mr. Kabakov’s company created FindFace, which permits anyone to search for anyone else using a photo rather than a name.
TL;DR—facial recognition has been in the wild for a while, but it’s been cumbersome and slow. It looks like that’s going to quickly change, which would mean lots more kinds of enterprises using it.
Stick around: the following gets into catfishing, porn actresses and a scary new era of public surveillance.
Mr. Kabakov and the company’s CEO, Artem Kukharenko, said that FindFace demonstrates the prowess of N-Tech’s facial recognition technology. It’s billed as a dating site, but their real agenda isn’t to enter the dating tech fray (Imagine how that would work: You take a photo of someone at a bar, ID them with FindFace and then send them an email over a social network about how you were too shy to say hello). The company claims that it can identify a person from a photo 70 percent of the time, a rate of success effectively verified by a Russian artist who tested it out by taking photos of whomever happened to be sitting across from him on the subway.
Alexander Kabakov (left) and Artem Kukharenko, co-founders of N-Tech Lab, the creators of FindFace. 
Right now, the site only uses the database of Russian social network, VK, to find faces and profiles to match with, so if you aren’t on there, FindFace can’t find you yet. A Canadian professor of educational technology, Dr. Alec Couros, likes N-Tech’s solution and he’d support its implementation on larger social networks, particularly across Mark Zuckerberg’s digital empire.
Dr. Couros has been the indirect victim of catfishing scammers. His likeness is widely used across multiple social media sites by people who use it to run romance scams that bilk lonely women out of money. In a YouTube video, he used FindFace to spot more than 20 fake VK profiles using his photos.
So VK HQ could also use the system to identify multiple profiles using photos of the same person, which would hamstring scammers.
Then, “if Facebook actually publicly used the tool, well … watch their user count drop like crazy. It’s ridiculous how many profiles I find using my face or others,” Dr. Couros wrote the Observer in an email. By “others” he means the many other men he’s come to know whose photos are also frequently used in these scams.
‘Maybe it will be a problem for social networks, not for us’
“There are large databases of popularly used photos,” he told us. “Military men are likely the most used photos (on the male side). Sub-famous porn stars are typically the photos used from the female side of of things.”
Which brings us to the darker application of FindFace’s technology. Global Voice’s AdVox has the story of how users of a Russian imageboard (also known as a “chan”), used the technology to identify women who have acted in Russian pornography. The women, formerly anonymous, were identified by their VK profiles and since harassed, as has by now been widely reported.
It’s an extreme case, but effectively illustrates how easily powerful facial recognition could be for really making it impossible for anyone to go anywhere without being tracked. Forget about your cell phone or your FitBit tattling on you. You could go out without carrying so much as a AA battery and the ubiquitous surveillance cameras of modern life will be able to identify you. If the camera on one block doesn’t get a good look at you, there’s sure to be another on the next block with a better angle.
Facial recognition isn’t precisely new, but it’s been too computationally expensive to scale. The founders argue N-Tech Lab’s system is special because of how much faster it is. It really has two breakthrough algorithms at work. One algorithm analyzes a photo and another one searches the database of faces. Other companies can recognize people, but they are slower and have smaller sets of faces. Their competitors take far more measurements on images than N-Tech does, whose file for a biometric reading of a face takes up about only one kilobyte of memory (effectively, nothing at all), Mr. Kukharenko explained. The file holds only about 80 numbers.
‘Facial recognition is a huge privacy threat’
“So we can use commodity, cheap hardware,” he explained. The company is doing 50 recognitions per second using Amazon Web Services, right now. That’s kind of like running a jet engine on Natural Light beer.
Search for any venture out there pitching software as a service to enterprise companies and their websites are sure to say that its technology is “cutting edge” and that its team is “the leader” in whatever application. N-Tech was able to bolster its claims to such a title, however, when it won a large dataset facial recognition competition organized by researchers at the University of Washington last year.
Dozens of teams competed in the contest called “Megaface,” using a dataset of a million photos, and a team from Mountain View came in second place. “We can’t imagine that four people in Russia beat a huge corporation such as Google,” Mr. Kabakov said.
Since then, a lot of different sectors have shown interest in what the young company’s technology can do. The co-founders said it already has a pilot project running with the city of Moscow’s video camera network, providing real time search for criminals and missing persons. “It has really helped for police to search crimes,” Mr. Kukharenko said.
It won’t stop at law enforcement. “The revolution of our technology is the feasibility for many companies to use it in many spheres,” Mr. Kabakov added.
‘The revolution of our technology is the feasibility for many companies to use it in many spheres’
Privacy advocates might argue that that’s precisely the problem. “Facial recognition is a huge privacy threat,” the ACLU’s Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst, told the Observer in a phone call. “It has the potential to remove anonymity from contexts where people have for hundreds of years enjoyed anonymity.” In other words, we used to only get recognized on the street if someone we actually knew saw us. Those days will soon be over.
While law enforcement is running facial recognition scans using surveillance cameras now, they probably don’t have enough computing firepower to search for more than a hotlist of criminal suspects and members of watch lists. By lowering the computational cost, N-Tech could make it feasible for the authorities to log everyone, just in case. Like the cops already do with license plates.  
All else being equal, it needn’t stop with the police. If you walk into a store and some clerk you’ve never seen before welcomes you by name, you’ll now know why. Organizations like the ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center have been way out ahead of this new way of watching. The former has written an ethical framework for facial recognition, while the latter delinated very similar concerns in a 2014 letter to the Department of Commerce.
Facial recognition brings us into a new era of tracking. We all vaguely know we’ve made a deal with the devil by carrying around cell phones, but by purchasing the device we’ve implicitly consented to carrying a GPS in our pocket. There’s no consent at all when a camera and a database logs the fact that we just walked by. None of us knew when we first loaded a profile photo onto Facebook that someday someone would be able to lift the equivalent of a fingerprint from it (and from every other photo that gets taken of us, whether we realize anyone is taking one or not).
In fact, automated facial identification could creep Internet users out so much that it might have a chilling effect on social sites. People may become more reluctant to share real photos of themselves. When asked about that, Mr. Kabakov laughed as he said, “Maybe it will be a problem for social networks, not for us.”
Realistically, the only people who could stop companies like N-Tech from logging their facial fingerprint at this point would be kids today whose parents have never posted any photos of them online. The internet has already had a good long look at the rest of us, and it is not going to forget what we look like.
- OK, so I never got that email, and it would surprise me if the retail chain had any idea that I stopped in that night.

Then, “if Facebook actually publicly used the tool, well … watch their user count drop like crazy. It’s ridiculous how many profiles I find using my face or others,” Dr. Couros wrote the Observer in an email. By “others” he means the many other men he’s come to know whose photos are also frequently used in these scams.
‘Maybe it will be a problem for social networks, not for us’
“There are large databases of popularly used photos,” he told us. “Military men are likely the most used photos (on the male side). Sub-famous porn stars are typically the photos used from the female side of of things.”
Which brings us to the darker application of FindFace’s technology. Global Voice’s AdVox has the story of how users of a Russian imageboard (also known as a “chan”), used the technology to identify women who have acted in Russian pornography. The women, formerly anonymous, were identified by their VK profiles and since harassed, as has by now been widely reported.
It’s an extreme case, but effectively illustrates how easily powerful facial recognition could be for really making it impossible for anyone to go anywhere without being tracked. Forget about your cell phone or your FitBit tattling on you. You could go out without carrying so much as a AA battery and the ubiquitous surveillance cameras of modern life will be able to identify you. If the camera on one block doesn’t get a good look at you, there’s sure to be another on the next block with a better angle.
Facial recognition isn’t precisely new, but it’s been too computationally expensive to scale. The founders argue N-Tech Lab’s system is special because of how much faster it is. It really has two breakthrough algorithms at work. One algorithm analyzes a photo and another one searches the database of faces. Other companies can recognize people, but they are slower and have smaller sets of faces. Their competitors take far more measurements on images than N-Tech does, whose file for a biometric reading of a face takes up about only one kilobyte of memory (effectively, nothing at all), Mr. Kukharenko explained. The file holds only about 80 numbers.
‘Facial recognition is a huge privacy threat’
“So we can use commodity, cheap hardware,” he explained. The company is doing 50 recognitions per second using Amazon Web Services, right now. That’s kind of like running a jet engine on Natural Light beer.
Search for any venture out there pitching software as a service to enterprise companies and their websites are sure to say that its technology is “cutting edge” and that its team is “the leader” in whatever application. N-Tech was able to bolster its claims to such a title, however, when it won a large dataset facial recognition competition organized by researchers at the University of Washington last year.
Dozens of teams competed in the contest called “Megaface,” using a dataset of a million photos, and a team from Mountain View came in second place. “We can’t imagine that four people in Russia beat a huge corporation such as Google,” Mr. Kabakov said.
Since then, a lot of different sectors have shown interest in what the young company’s technology can do. The co-founders said it already has a pilot project running with the city of Moscow’s video camera network, providing real time search for criminals and missing persons. “It has really helped for police to search crimes,” Mr. Kukharenko said.
It won’t stop at law enforcement. “The revolution of our technology is the feasibility for many companies to use it in many spheres,” Mr. Kabakov added.
‘The revolution of our technology is the feasibility for many companies to use it in many spheres’
Privacy advocates might argue that that’s precisely the problem. “Facial recognition is a huge privacy threat,” the ACLU’s Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst, told the Observer in a phone call. “It has the potential to remove anonymity from contexts where people have for hundreds of years enjoyed anonymity.” In other words, we used to only get recognized on the street if someone we actually knew saw us. Those days will soon be over.
While law enforcement is running facial recognition scans using surveillance cameras now, they probably don’t have enough computing firepower to search for more than a hotlist of criminal suspects and members of watch lists. By lowering the computational cost, N-Tech could make it feasible for the authorities to log everyone, just in case. Like the cops already do with license plates.  
All else being equal, it needn’t stop with the police. If you walk into a store and some clerk you’ve never seen before welcomes you by name, you’ll now know why. Organizations like the ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center have been way out ahead of this new way of watching. The former has written an ethical framework for facial recognition, while the latter delinated very similar concerns in a 2014 letter to the Department of Commerce.
Facial recognition brings us into a new era of tracking. We all vaguely know we’ve made a deal with the devil by carrying around cell phones, but by purchasing the device we’ve implicitly consented to carrying a GPS in our pocket. There’s no consent at all when a camera and a database logs the fact that we just walked by. None of us knew when we first loaded a profile photo onto Facebook that someday someone would be able to lift the equivalent of a fingerprint from it (and from every other photo that gets taken of us, whether we realize anyone is taking one or not).
In fact, automated facial identification could creep Internet users out so much that it might have a chilling effect on social sites. People may become more reluctant to share real photos of themselves. When asked about that, Mr. Kabakov laughed as he said, “Maybe it will be a problem for social networks, not for us.”
Realistically, the only people who could stop companies like N-Tech from logging their facial fingerprint at this point would be kids today whose parents have never posted any photos of them online. The internet has already had a good long look at the rest of us, and it is not going to forget what we look like.
- TL;DR—facial recognition has been in the wild for a while, but it’s been cumbersome and slow. It looks like that’s going to quickly change, which would mean lots more kinds of enterprises using it.
Stick around: the following gets into catfishing, porn actresses and a scary new era of public surveillance.
Mr. Kabakov and the company’s CEO, Artem Kukharenko, said that FindFace demonstrates the prowess of N-Tech’s facial recognition technology. It’s billed as a dating site, but their real agenda isn’t to enter the dating tech fray (Imagine how that would work: You take a photo of someone at a bar, ID them with FindFace and then send them an email over a social network about how you were too shy to say hello). The company claims that it can identify a person from a photo 70 percent of the time, a rate of success effectively verified by a Russian artist who tested it out by taking photos of whomever happened to be sitting across from him on the subway.

Right now, the site only uses the database of Russian social network, VK, to find faces and profiles to match with, so if you aren’t on there, FindFace can’t find you yet. A Canadian professor of educational technology, Dr. Alec Couros, likes N-Tech’s solution and he’d support its implementation on larger social networks, particularly across Mark Zuckerberg’s digital empire.

We all vaguely know we’ve made a deal with the devil by carrying around cell phones, but by purchasing the device we’ve implicitly consented to carrying a GPS in our pocket. There’s no consent at all when a camera and a database logs the fact that we just walked by. None of us knew when we first loaded a profile photo onto Facebook that someday someone would be able to lift the equivalent of a fingerprint from it (and from every other photo that gets taken of us, whether we realize anyone is taking one or not).
In fact, automated facial identification could creep Internet users out so much that it might have a chilling effect on social sites. People may become more reluctant to share real photos of themselves. When asked about that, Mr. Kabakov laughed as he said, “Maybe it will be a problem for social networks, not for us.”
Realistically, the only people who could stop companies like N-Tech from logging their facial fingerprint at this point would be kids today whose parents have never posted any photos of them online. The internet has already had a good long look at the rest of us, and it is not going to forget what we look like.
- Dr. Couros has been the indirect victim of catfishing scammers. His likeness is widely used across multiple social media sites by people who use it to run romance scams that bilk lonely women out of money. In a YouTube video, he used FindFace to spot more than 20 fake VK profiles using his photos.
So VK HQ could also use the system to identify multiple profiles using photos of the same person, which would hamstring scammers.
Then, “if Facebook actually publicly used the tool, well … watch their user count drop like crazy. It’s ridiculous how many profiles I find using my face or others,” Dr. Couros wrote the Observer in an email. By “others” he means the many other men he’s come to know whose photos are also frequently used in these scams.
‘Maybe it will be a problem for social networks, not for us’
“There are large databases of popularly used photos,” he told us. “Military men are likely the most used photos (on the male side). Sub-famous porn stars are typically the photos used from the female side of of things.”
Which brings us to the darker application of FindFace’s technology. Global Voice’s AdVox has the story of how users of a Russian imageboard (also known as a “chan”), used the technology to identify women who have acted in Russian pornography. The women, formerly anonymous, were identified by their VK profiles and since harassed, as has by now been widely reported.
It’s an extreme case, but effectively illustrates how easily powerful facial recognition could be for really making it impossible for anyone to go anywhere without being tracked. Forget about your cell phone or your FitBit tattling on you. You could go out without carrying so much as a AA battery and the ubiquitous surveillance cameras of modern life will be able to identify you. If the camera on one block doesn’t get a good look at you, there’s sure to be another on the next block with a better angle.
Facial recognition isn’t precisely new, but it’s been too computationally expensive to scale. The founders argue N-Tech Lab’s system is special because of how much faster it is. It really has two breakthrough algorithms at work. One algorithm analyzes a photo and another one searches the database of faces. Other companies can recognize people, but they are slower and have smaller sets of faces. Their competitors take far more measurements on images than N-Tech does, whose file for a biometric reading of a face takes up about only one kilobyte of memory (effectively, nothing at all), Mr. Kukharenko explained. The file holds only about 80 numbers.
‘Facial recognition is a huge privacy threat’
“So we can use commodity, cheap hardware,” he explained. The company is doing 50 recognitions per second using Amazon Web Services, right now. That’s kind of like running a jet engine on Natural Light beer.
Search for any venture out there pitching software as a service to enterprise companies and their websites are sure to say that its technology is “cutting edge” and that its team is “the leader” in whatever application. N-Tech was able to bolster its claims to such a title, however, when it won a large dataset facial recognition competition organized by researchers at the University of Washington last year.
Dozens of teams competed in the contest called “Megaface,” using a dataset of a million photos, and a team from Mountain View came in second place. “We can’t imagine that four people in Russia beat a huge corporation such as Google,” Mr. Kabakov said.
Since then, a lot of different sectors have shown interest in what the young company’s technology can do. The co-founders said it already has a pilot project running with the city of Moscow’s video camera network, providing real time search for criminals and missing persons. “It has really helped for police to search crimes,” Mr. Kukharenko said.
It won’t stop at law enforcement. “The revolution of our technology is the feasibility for many companies to use it in many spheres,” Mr. Kabakov added.
‘The revolution of our technology is the feasibility for many companies to use it in many spheres’
Privacy advocates might argue that that’s precisely the problem. “Facial recognition is a huge privacy threat,” the ACLU’s Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst, told the Observer in a phone call. “It has the potential to remove anonymity from contexts where people have for hundreds of years enjoyed anonymity.” In other words, we used to only get recognized on the street if someone we actually knew saw us. Those days will soon be over.
While law enforcement is running facial recognition scans using surveillance cameras now, they probably don’t have enough computing firepower to search for more than a hotlist of criminal suspects and members of watch lists. By lowering the computational cost, N-Tech could make it feasible for the authorities to log everyone, just in case. Like the cops already do with license plates.  
All else being equal, it needn’t stop with the police. If you walk into a store and some clerk you’ve never seen before welcomes you by name, you’ll now know why. Organizations like the ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center have been way out ahead of this new way of watching. The former has written an ethical framework for facial recognition, while the latter delinated very similar concerns in a 2014 letter to the Department of Commerce.

There’s no consent at all when a camera and a database logs the fact that we just walked by. None of us knew when we first loaded a profile photo onto Facebook that someday someone would be able to lift the equivalent of a fingerprint from it (and from every other photo that gets taken of us, whether we realize anyone is taking one or not).
In fact, automated facial identification could creep Internet users out so much that it might have a chilling effect on social sites. People may become more reluctant to share real photos of themselves. When asked about that, Mr. Kabakov laughed as he said, “Maybe it will be a problem for social networks, not for us.”
Realistically, the only people who could stop companies like N-Tech from logging their facial fingerprint at this point would be kids today whose parents have never posted any photos of them online. The internet has already had a good long look at the rest of us, and it is not going to forget what we look like.
- It’s an extreme case, but effectively illustrates how easily powerful facial recognition could be for really making it impossible for anyone to go anywhere without being tracked. Forget about your cell phone or your FitBit tattling on you. You could go out without carrying so much as a AA battery and the ubiquitous surveillance cameras of modern life will be able to identify you. If the camera on one block doesn’t get a good look at you, there’s sure to be another on the next block with a better angle.
Facial recognition isn’t precisely new, but it’s been too computationally expensive to scale. The founders argue N-Tech Lab’s system is special because of how much faster it is. It really has two breakthrough algorithms at work. One algorithm analyzes a photo and another one searches the database of faces. Other companies can recognize people, but they are slower and have smaller sets of faces. Their competitors take far more measurements on images than N-Tech does, whose file for a biometric reading of a face takes up about only one kilobyte of memory (effectively, nothing at all), Mr. Kukharenko explained. The file holds only about 80 numbers.
‘Facial recognition is a huge privacy threat’
“So we can use commodity, cheap hardware,” he explained. The company is doing 50 recognitions per second using Amazon Web Services, right now. That’s kind of like running a jet engine on Natural Light beer.
Search for any venture out there pitching software as a service to enterprise companies and their websites are sure to say that its technology is “cutting edge” and that its team is “the leader” in whatever application. N-Tech was able to bolster its claims to such a title, however, when it won a large dataset facial recognition competition organized by researchers at the University of Washington last year.
Dozens of teams competed in the contest called “Megaface,” using a dataset of a million photos, and a team from Mountain View came in second place. “We can’t imagine that four people in Russia beat a huge corporation such as Google,” Mr. Kabakov said.
Since then, a lot of different sectors have shown interest in what the young company’s technology can do. The co-founders said it already has a pilot project running with the city of Moscow’s video camera network, providing real time search for criminals and missing persons. “It has really helped for police to search crimes,” Mr. Kukharenko said.
It won’t stop at law enforcement. “The revolution of our technology is the feasibility for many companies to use it in many spheres,” Mr. Kabakov added.
‘The revolution of our technology is the feasibility for many companies to use it in many spheres’
Privacy advocates might argue that that’s precisely the problem. “Facial recognition is a huge privacy threat,” the ACLU’s Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst, told the Observer in a phone call. “It has the potential to remove anonymity from contexts where people have for hundreds of years enjoyed anonymity.” In other words, we used to only get recognized on the street if someone we actually knew saw us. Those days will soon be over.
While law enforcement is running facial recognition scans using surveillance cameras now, they probably don’t have enough computing firepower to search for more than a hotlist of criminal suspects and members of watch lists. By lowering the computational cost, N-Tech could make it feasible for the authorities to log everyone, just in case. Like the cops already do with license plates.  
All else being equal, it needn’t stop with the police. If you walk into a store and some clerk you’ve never seen before welcomes you by name, you’ll now know why. Organizations like the ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center have been way out ahead of this new way of watching. The former has written an ethical framework for facial recognition, while the latter delinated very similar concerns in a 2014 letter to the Department of Commerce.

The internet has already had a good long look at the rest of us, and it is not going to forget what we look like.
- While law enforcement is running facial recognition scans using surveillance cameras now, they probably don’t have enough computing firepower to search for more than a hotlist of criminal suspects and members of watch lists. By lowering the computational cost, N-Tech could make it feasible for the authorities to log everyone, just in case. Like the cops already do with license plates.  
All else being equal, it needn’t stop with the police. If you walk into a store and some clerk you’ve never seen before welcomes you by name, you’ll now know why. Organizations like the ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center have been way out ahead of this new way of watching. The former has written an ethical framework for facial recognition, while the latter delinated very similar concerns in a 2014 letter to the Department of Commerce.
Facial recognition brings us into a new era of tracking. We all vaguely know we’ve made a deal with the devil by carrying around cell phones, but by purchasing the device we’ve implicitly consented to carrying a GPS in our pocket. There’s no consent at all when a camera and a database logs the fact that we just walked by. None of us knew when we first loaded a profile photo onto Facebook that someday someone would be able to lift the equivalent of a fingerprint from it (and from every other photo that gets taken of us, whether we realize anyone is taking one or not).
In fact, automated facial identification could creep Internet users out so much that it might have a chilling effect on social sites. People may become more reluctant to share real photos of themselves. When asked about that, Mr. Kabakov laughed as he said, “Maybe it will be a problem for social networks, not for us.”

- Moscow has launched a massive facial recognition system. One of the vendors supplying the tools says ... [+] it's the biggest system of its kind in the world. (Photo by Andrei Makhonin\TASS via Getty Images)
- Built on several tens of thousands of cameras and what's claimed to be one of the most advanced facial recognition systems on the planet, Moscow has been quietly switching on a massive surveillance project this month.
- The software that's helping monitor all those faces is FindFace, the product of NtechLab, a company that some reports claimed would bring "an end to anonymity" with its FindFace app. Launched in the mid-2010s, it allowed users to take a picture of someone and match their face to their to social media profiles on Russian site Vkontakte (VK).
- Since then, NtechLab shut down the consumer app and pivoted to government surveillance, this week revealing it’s being paid at least $3.2 million for deploying its tools across the Russian capital. The initial news was broken in Russian media on Tuesday.
- NtechLab CEO Alex Minin claims, in an interview with Forbes, that it’s the biggest “live” facial recognition project in the world, even if there are larger non-real-time deployments. Real-time, live recognition can pick faces out in a crowd and instantly say whether or not they match those in police databases of wanted criminals. London’s Met Police have been testing out a similar system with Japanese provider NEC. Older, “archived” facial recognition is slower as police have to take recorded footage and run it through a facial recognition system to find a match.
- There remain deep concerns about the privacy implications for such technology, given the constant live scanning of people’s faces. Combined with Russia’s poor human rights record, the surveillance system in Moscow will worry those fearful of a Putin-led Big Brother state. Just last year, Russian women’s rights activist Alyona Popova filed a lawsuit against the Moscow city government over the project, claiming it violated privacy rights. The lawsuit was swiftly thrown out of court, however.
- But Minin is proud of the work, saying the company has been working on the project for two years and it was now finally being switched on. “The technology can can work across hundred thousands of cameras in real time,” Minin claims. He says one of the unique selling points of the business’ facial recognition tech is that it doesn’t require training on databases of faces beforehand like most systems do; it uses “very neat neural networks” to made assessments as to whether a face is a match. That means there’s less chance of racial bias — something that other tools have been criticized for, Minin adds.
- Will NTechLab’s tech ever reach the U.S.? It’s possible, given American government organizations rate the tech highly. It’s been ranked highly by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for detecting faces and human activities and, though there are some security concerns for U.S. government bodies working with Russian companies, NTechLab has a partnership with Genetec, a video surveillance provider that already has contracts with the American government.
- It’ll be going up against some significant startups if it does emerge as a U.S. player, including ClearView, which was the subject of a New York Times investigation. The Peter Thiel-backed business scrapes social sites like Facebook and Twitter and helps police find matches with its massive database of faces. Minin wasn’t sure about that strategy, given it wasn’t dissimilar to what FindFace used to do. “[ClearView] are creating really bad perception in general about the face recognition,” he added.
- NtechLab has also been working on some high-tech glasses, which a police officer wears and will alert them to possibly criminal faces as they march about the city. According to the NYT, ClearView appeared to be working on similar tech. NtechLab at least has a product, but it remains a prototype and is not part of the huge Moscow system. “At least, not yet,” said NtechLab’s comms chief Nikolay Grunin. “The technical capability to use them remains and the pilots still continue.”

- Unless you are from Russia, you probably haven’t heard of a service, that analyzes an image of a person and finds their account in VK.com social network. It’s called FindFace. It was introduced in February 2016, but has recently become quite popular; thanks to the impressive photo project, published by the St.Petersburg photographer Egor Tsvetkov. We’ve recently mentioned this project in a blog post.
- 
- The Kaspersky Daily editorial team decided to check out the service to see how it works and what types of portraits it recognizes and what it does not. We wanted to know if it’s possible to find out a detailed biography of a complete stranger with the help of one accidental photo, the Internet and some modern technology.

- 
- The conclusions are alarming: it’s actually possible. During the research we also made several interesting discoveries; for example, one of our colleagues suddenly found out that his digital identity was stolen.
- FindFace is a service that can search for VK.com accounts on the base of a portrait photo of a person. 30 search attempts are free, then you’ll have to pay.
- The service has mobile apps for iOS and Android , complimented by a website version. Applications come with limited functionality and several flaws in work, but they have one valuable advantage: users can take a photo and immediately use it to search with FindFace.
- The app shows profile photos of the potential matches. You can click on each photo to look through all public images on the user’s account. Just look at Egor Tsvetkov’s work in the ‘Your Face is Big Data’ project to see how easy it is to find a complete stranger.
- The Web service is more convenient as it lets you immediately jump to your target’s VK.com account. To search for a person using the website you’ll have to perform several additional steps like copying photos to your hard drive first and then uploading them to the FindFace.ru.
- If you upload “ideal” photos, that were taken when your target was posing, everything works just great. The program has successfully found 9 of 10 test “victims” in the office.
- If you take photos of strangers on the streets or in the subway sneakily, accuracy decreases two or even three times. And if you upload images taken from a long distance, the service often becomes unable to find a human in the photo. Still, if you zoom or crop the image, FindFace will work again.

- 
- In the daylight it’s not hard to take a photo of a pedestrian with an average smartphone that would be good enough for Findface. In the subway you’ll need to use tripod or a good camera.
- If you don’t want to be detected literally by any stranger with a phone, there are several things that you can do.
- 1. The service searches photos uploaded to your VK.com profile, not the whole account. This includes your current profile picture and all the previous ones. The social network keeps these photos in the ‘My profile photos’ album. It’s noteworthy that you can’t hide this album — it always stays public. The only thing you can do is to delete old profile images: the less photos you have in that album, the harder it is for the app to recognize you.
- Tip: delete old photos. Store only the latest picture in this album to save yourself from face recognition tyranny.
- 2. It’s possible to hinder facial recognition by wearing hoodies or turning your head away from the camera or at an unusual angle. Making funny faces is also an option, with some exceptions. Eyeglasses with solid rings work just perfect, unless you have a photo with the same eyeglasses in your profile (or with the same funny face).

- 
- 3. Many volunteers, who took part in the experiment, did not know that they had so many public photos. Yes, they’ve checked privacy options in ‘Settings’ but it was not enough as VK lets you limit access to albums only (and then only not all of them), not certain photos in particular.
- 
- Tip: ask anybody you know and trust to unfriend you (and befriend again after the test), explore your account and check what’s visible and what’s not. Then move photos from public albums to private if required.
- 4. FindFace works absolutely legally: it doesn’t cache data to show any information, hidden by the social media settings. When we removed all photos from VK.com, the service became unable to find us during the second search. Still it’s very possible that in future a new service could appear, which would behave more badly: for example, it could store the data from other popular social networks like Facebook or Instagram. So it’s better to check twice the security settings for other social media accounts beforehand.

- — Kaspersky Lab (@kaspersky) January 7, 2016
- 
- 5. FindFace describes itself as a dating service. For example, you see an attractive person, take a photo and browse through their account — ok, now you’ve to a topic to make a pass. In fact, this service can let you make a lot of more useful — and strange — things.
- Just remember a story recently revealed by ABC news: surveillance camera took a video of burglars, robbing a house. If this happened in Russian-speaking countries there would be a 99% chance that criminals would have an account on VK.com. One could use the service to find the culprits.
- On the other hand, many people in social media use fake names for privacy concerns, but publish real photos. They think that Internet is too huge and nobody will find them by a photo. Well, they sure will do if they want to. For example, employers like to check candidate’s pages on social networks before an job interview.
- Some people just don’t publish any photos in social networks. At all. For example, one of our employees operates in this manner. Yet, FindFace found him.
- The thing is that somebody called “Vitek Tizinksilov” copied his photo from the gallery of another user, which was published in a different social network, and decided to use it as his profile picture.

- — Kaspersky Lab (@kaspersky) January 27, 2016
- 
- When we’ve tried searching Google Images for the very same photo, we’ve found that this image was used as a profile pic on yet another social network as well, called Fotostrana (which can be translated as Photo Country). It was not a sweet discovery at all.
- So if you don’t upload anything online it doesn’t mean that you’re invisible: your friends might do it instead of you. If they post your portrait or even a group photo with you — nobody can predict the future of this image.
- Tip: Before VK.com locks API used by this app to work you can check if you have any clones on the social media.

- Most security news is about insecurity, hacking and cyber threats, bordering on scary. But when security is done right, it's a beautiful thing...sexy even. Security IS sexy.
- How would you like it if you some stranger snapped your picture while you were out and about and then used that photo to find out your real name and other information about you?
- FindFace facial recognition may not be brand new, but the app boasts of a 70% accuracy as in snap a photo of a stranger and then find out who that person is via their social media profile. For now, it works with VK, which is like a Russian version of Facebook, but it has been downloaded 500,000 times since February and has searched about three million photos.
- “With this algorithm, you can search through a billion photographs in less than a second from a normal computer,” FindFace co-founder Alexander Kabakov told The Guardian. Talking about how the app could revolutionize dating, he added:
- “If you see someone you like, you can photograph them, find their identity, and then send them a friend request. It also looks for similar people. So you could just upload a photo of a movie star you like, or your ex, and then find 10 girls who look similar to her and send them messages.”
- If that’s not creepy enough for you, then there’s the Orwellian aspect of law enforcement and retail being the “real money-spinner” for the face recognition technology.
- NTech Lab, which created FindFace, “upstaged” over 100 other facial recognition algorithms in the University of Washington’s MegaFace challenge by achieving a 73.3% accuracy on one million faces; it even beat Google’s “FaceNet” which had previously reached a 99.63% accuracy level (pdf) in different testing.
- After winning the competition, NTech suggested its face recognition technology could be used by law enforcement “to search for and identify possible or wanted criminals using streaming video cameras,” or used by customs to identify people on watchlists, or to “verify and monitor” fans in real-time such as at sporting or entertainment events.
- Since winning MegaFace, law enforcement has shown an interest. Russian police are using the technology in a pilot program via Moscow’s video camera network to search for criminals. NTech co-founder Alexander Kabakov told The Guardian, “It’s nuts: there were cases that had seen no movement for years, and now they are being solved.”
- Sometimes it seems like face recognition is everywhere, used for social media sites and even at Church. The NSA has intercepted “millions” of photos daily and fed the “facial recognition quality images” into its facial recognition programs. The FBI was supposed to have 52 million photos in its NGI face recognition database by 2015 and was reportedly populating the database with photos snapped in the field. Face recognition is used by other law enforcement agencies such as police in Boston and San Diego.
- The thing about FindFace is that it is not only fast, but it requires less computational resources than most facial recognition solutions; by lowering the computational costs, the Observer suggested, “N-Tech could make it feasible for the authorities to log everyone, just in case. Like the cops already do with license plates.”
- 
- Some people may find it really cool, but it’s already proved handy for stalking. Russian art school student Egor Tsvetkov took photos of strangers sitting across from him on the subway and then published his “Your face is big data” project; acting “like a Web stalker,” he linked the strangers’ photos to their VK profiles. Tsvetkov said that in theory, FindFace “could be used by a serial killer or a collector trying to hunt down a debtor.”
- Immediately afterwards, the 2chan Russian imageboard launched a campaign using FindFace and VK to deanonymize and dox porn actresses. In the wrong hands, a tool like FindFace could be a death sentence for dissidents and victims of domestic abuse.
- The idea of strangers or law enforcement using a face recognition app that requires little computational power to put a name to your face for no reason other than they want to? That should raise your privacy hackles. It may not be the only face recognition tech in the game, but it could spell an end to anonymity in public, open the door for harassment by strangers and put countless people at risk.
- However, some people like Dr. Alec Couros, who have been an “indirect victim of catfishing,” would like for FindFace to be more widely available. He told The Observer, “If Facebook actually publicly used the tool, well … watch their user count drop like crazy.” Couros used FindFace to identify over 20 fake VK profiles using his pictures.
- When Kasperksy Lab tested FindFace, it even identified a Kaspersky employee who doesn’t post any photos in any social networks; someone had posted his picture on a different social network and another user stole it and used it as his profile picture.
- Kaspersky said FindFace “successfully found 9 of 10 test ‘victims’ in the office.” A positive note was that FindFace was two or three times less accurate if you take photos of strangers from a distance in the subway. If you crop and zoom, however, FindFace works again.
- If a photo is taken during daylight, “with an average smartphone,” then it would be good enough to work for FindFace. If you don’t want to be “detected literally by any stranger with a phone,” then Kaspersky suggested deleting old photos from VK accounts, or trying to shield your face such as by wearing a hoodie.

- That’s exactly the question being asked about FindFace, a new facial recognition app that uses profile photos of Russia’s leading social network to find the identity of anyone in a photo with a ridiculous 70-percent success rate.
- The key to the whole operation is the use of Russia’s Vkontakte social network in collaboration with a proprietary search algorithm developed by FindFace’s twenty-something co-founders, Alexander Kabakov and Artem Kukharenko.
- Using profile photos of Vkontakte’s 200 million users, FindFace’s algorithm is able to search through a database of over one billion photographs in mere seconds, using only four standard servers. What users are given as a result is the closest match FindFace could detect and the ten closest matches after that. Strangely, in its video demo and marketing images, FindFace seems to focus only on women, which makes the app look like it could be used for nefarious purposes.
- While the app is impressive in its own right, the app is nothing more than a teaser for what the FindFace backend is truly capable of achieving.
- Already, the startup has been approached by the local Moscow government to work alongside the city’s 150,000 CCTV cameras to help identify criminals on-the-fly. Mugshots and other visuals would be imported into the database and using the FindFace’s algorithm, police would be able to track down a criminal in mere seconds using pinpoint accuracy.
- In addition to government use, FindFace seems very interested in getting into retail and marketing.
- “Kabakov imagines a world where cameras fix you looking at, say, a stereo in a shop, the retailer finds your identity, and then targets you with marketing for stereos in the subsequent days,” The Guardian reported.
- It’s the epitome of targeted marketing, and so long as companies are willing to pay, Kabakov and Kukharenko seem ready to bite.
- “In today’s world we are surrounded by gadgets,” Kabakov told The Guardian. “Our phones, televisions, fridges, everything around us is sending real-time information about us. Already we have full data on people’s movements, their interests and so on. A person should understand that in the modern world he is under the spotlight of technology. You just have to live with that.”
- If you’re wondering when FindFace would aim for the much larger target of using Facebook and its 1.65 billion users as a database, don’t count on it being anytime soon, if ever.
- According to FindFace’s founders, Facebook is far stricter on its privacy policies. This means the FindFace algorithm can’t access multiple profile images like it can with the less secure Vkontakte.
- If you’re good with Russian, have a Vkontakte profile, and want to take the FindFace for a spin, you can download it in both the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.
- Let’s say you live in a country where there’s been reports of massive outbreaks of a highly contagious viral infection. Hypothetically, let’s call this infection "coronavirus." To avoid spreading this "coronavirus," many people have taken to wearing medical face masks when going about their everyday life. These masks don’t do much, medically speaking, but it’s considered the polite thing to do.
- Now, let’s also say that the government there is notorious for widespread and unregulated use of facial-recognition technology as a way to both fight crime and to identify and silence political dissidents.
- No one seems to be able to figure out if what Clearview AI is doing is legal, a quandary that has exposed the messy patchwork of laws that allow exploitation of people’s personal data to profligate.
- As reported first by CNET, Google and YouTube recently sent cease-and-desist letters to Clearview -- the controversial law enforcement facial recognition technology -- over its scraping of their sites for people’s information. Twitter sent one in January, while Facebook is said to be reviewing Clearview’s practices.
- The latest example of Silicon Valley's hubris is the facial-recognition app Clearview AI. The small startup's app is so powerful that someone could walk up to you on the street, snap your photo, and quickly find out your name, address, and phone number, according to a report in The New York Times.
- This technology probably sounds like a great idea to two types of people: Law enforcement and creeps. Advocates worry this kind of facial-recognition technology could be a boon to stalkers, people with a history of domestic abuse, and anyone else who would want to find out everything about you for a nefarious purpose.
