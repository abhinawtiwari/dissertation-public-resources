- A chess-playing robot has grabbed and broke the finger of a seven-year old competitor during a match at the Moscow Open, according (in Russian) to Tass. The boy played the rest of the tournament in a plaster cast.
- Apparently unsettled by the quick responses of his opponent, the robot is seen to have pinched the boy's finger for several seconds before he is freed and led away by a woman and three men.
- Russian Chess Federation vice-president Sergey Smagin told Tass the robot appeared to pounce after the boy opted for a quick move after it had taken one of the boy’s pieces, thereby violating 'certain safety rules'.
- The Russian Chess Federation declined to say who manufactured the robot, or how it works. Video of the incident shows the machine appears to be a standard industrial robot arm that has been customised to move pieces on three chess boards simultaneously.

- МОСКВА, 21 июля. /Корр. ТАСС Андрей Карташов/. Робот-шахматист сломал палец ребенку во время международного шахматного форума Moscow Chess Open, проходившего в Москве с 13 по 21 июля. Об этом ТАСС в четверг рассказал президент Федерации шахмат Москвы Сергей Лазарев.
- "Робот сломал палец ребенку - это, конечно, плохо. Робот нами был арендован, он выставляется много где, уже давно, со специалистами. Видимо, недосмотрели операторы. Ребенок сделал ход, и после этого надо дать время на ответ робота, но мальчик поспешил, робот схватил его. Мы к роботу отношения не имеем", - сказал Лазарев.
- "Ребенок играл уже на следующий день, доиграл турнир в гипсе, а волонтеры помогали записывать ходы. Сейчас звонил Москомспорт, родители хотят обратиться в прокуратуру, будем общаться, разбираться и постараемся помочь [семье], чем сможем. А операторам робота, видимо, придется подумать над усилением защиты, чтобы подобная ситуация не повторялась", - добавил собеседник агентства.

- Moscow incident occurred because child ‘violated’ safety rules by taking turn too quickly, says official
- Played by humans, chess is a game of strategic thinking, calm concentration and patient intellectual endeavour. Violence does not usually come into it. The same, it seems, cannot always be said of machines.
- Last week, according to Russian media outlets, a chess-playing robot, apparently unsettled by the quick responses of a seven-year-old boy, unceremoniously grabbed and broke his finger during a match at the Moscow Open.
- “The robot broke the child’s finger,” Sergey Lazarev, president of the Moscow Chess Federation, told the TASS news agency after the incident, adding that the machine had played many previous exhibitions without upset. “This is of course bad.”
- Video of the 19 July incident published by the Baza Telegram channel shows the boy’s finger being pinched by the robotic arm for several seconds before a woman followed by three men rush in, free him and usher him away.
- Sergey Smagin, vice-president of the Russian Chess Federation, told Baza the robot appeared to pounce after it took one of the boy’s pieces. Rather than waiting for the machine to complete its move, the boy opted for a quick riposte, he said.
- “There are certain safety rules and the child, apparently, violated them. When he made his move, he did not realise he first had to wait,” Smagin said. “This is an extremely rare case, the first I can recall,” he added.
- Lazarev had a different account, saying the child had “made a move, and after that we need to give time for the robot to answer, but the boy hurried and the robot grabbed him”. Either way, he said, the robot’s suppliers were “going to have to think again”.
- Baza named the boy as Christopher and said he was one of the 30 best chess players in the Russian capital in the under-nines category. “People rushed to help and pulled out the finger of the young player, but the fracture could not be avoided,” it said.
- Lazarev told Tass that Christopher, whose finger was put in a plaster cast, did not seem overly traumatised by the attack. “The child played the very next day, finished the tournament, and volunteers helped to record the moves,” he said.
- His parents, however, have reportedly contacted the public prosecutor’s office. “We will communicate, figure it out and try to help in any way we can,” he said. Smagin told RIA Novosti the incident was “a coincidence” and the robot was “absolutely safe”.
- The machine, which can play multiple matches at a time and had reportedly already played three on the day it encountered Christopher, was “unique”, he said. “It has performed at many opens. Apparently, children need to be warned. It happens.”
- A Russian grandmaster, Sergey Karjakin, said the incident was no doubt due to “some kind of software error or something”, adding: “This has never happened before. There are such accidents. I wish the boy good health.”
- Christopher may have been lucky. While robots are becoming more and more sophisticated, with the most modern models capable not just of interacting but actively cooperating with humans, most simply repeat the same basic actions – grab, move, put down – and neither know nor care if people get in the way.
- According to one 2015 study, one person is killed each year by an industrial robot in the US alone. Indeed, according to the US occupational safety administration, most occupational accidents since 2000 involving robots have been fatalities.
- Robert Williams, widely considered the first, was crushed to death by the arm of a one-tonne robot on Ford’s Michigan production line in 1979. In 2015, a robot killed a 22-year old contractor at one of Volkswagen’s German plants, grabbing him and crushing him against a metal plate.
- Robots used in medical surgery were also held responsible for the deaths of 144 people between 2008 and 2013. More recently, Elaine Herzberg was killed by an Uber autonomous car that hit the 49-year-old at 40mph as she was crossing the road in Tempe, Arizona in 2018.
- Generally, however, human error – or a lack of human understanding of robotic processes – is the most frequent cause. It pays to be careful around robots, even if they are only playing chess.

- A chess-playing robot broke a boy’s finger during a match in Russia last week, the president of the Moscow Chess Federation told state news agency TASS media.
- Sergey Lazarev said the incident occurred at the Moscow Chess Open after the boy rushed the robot.
- “A robot broke a child’s finger – this is, of course, bad,” Lazarev said.
- “The robot was rented by us, it has been exhibited in many places by specialists for a long time. Apparently, the operators overlooked some flaws. The child made a move, and after that it is necessary to give time for the robot to respond, but the boy hurried, the robot grabbed him. We have nothing to do with the robot.”
- The boy continued to compete in the forum after his finger was put in a cast, Lazarev said on Thursday. The incident happened last Tuesday.

- “The child played the next day, finished the tournament in a cast, and volunteers helped to record the moves,” Lazarev added.
- “We will coordinate to understand what happened and try to help [the family] in any way we can. And the robot’s operators, apparently, will have to think about strengthening protection so that such a situation does not happen again.”
- Video published on the Baza Telegram channel shows the robot grabbing the boy’s finger. After a brief struggle, several bystanders help to free the child’s hand and take him away from the table.
- “The robot did not like such a rush – he grabbed the boy’s index finger and squeezed it hard. Bystanders rushed to help and pulled out the finger of the young player, but the fracture could not be avoided,” the Baza Telegram channel said in its post.
- The Moscow Chess Open took place in the Russian capital from July 13 to 21.

- A chess-playing robot broke the finger of a 7-year-old boy who was competing against it during a recent tournament in Moscow.
- According to officials from the Moscow Chess Federation, the child continued his participation in the event after his finger was placed in a plaster cast.
- Both officials, in comments to a pair of state news agencies translated from Russian, appeared to place at least some of the blame for the incident on the boy.
- “The child made a move, and after that we need to give time for the robot to answer, but the boy hurried, the robot grabbed him,” Sergey Lazarev, president of the Moscow Chess Federation, told TASS. “We have nothing to do with the robot.”

- “The robot broke the child’s finger — this, of course, is bad,” Lazarev added. “The robot was rented by us. It has been exhibited in many places, for a long time, with specialists.”
- “It happens — a coincidence. It is necessary, apparently, to warn the children additionally,” federation vice president Sergey Smagin told RIA Novosti. “It is extremely strange that this happened, but it happened, it happens.”

- Baza, a Russian online news outlet, reported that the robot “grabbed the boy’s index finger and squeezed it hard.” Tournament staffers rushed over to help extricate him from the robot’s grip.
- At the time, the robot was playing a chess match against three children at once. Baza described the victim as one of the “30 strongest” chess players in Moscow under 9 years old.
- The child’s parents “want to contact the prosecutor’s office,” said Lazarev, who asserted his organization would try to assist the family.
- The robot was familiar to chess officials, having been in use, according to Smagin, for approximately 15 years. He added that, to his recollection, it was the first time anything like this had happened.
- Smagin said there was no talk of banning the robot, but he and Lazarev suggested its operators look into updated safety measures.
- “It will be necessary to analyze why this happened,” Smagin said. “The robot has a very talented inventor. It may be necessary to install an additional protection system.”

- By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge.
- A chess robot broke the finger of a seven-year-old boy playing in a tournament in Russia, according to reports from local news outlets (seen via The Guardian).
- The incident happened last week at the Moscow Chess Open, where the robot was hired to play competitors. Video of the incident (below) shows the machine is a standard industrial robot arm customized to move pieces on three chess boards simultaneously.
- “The robot broke the child’s finger. This, of course, is bad,” Sergey Lazarev, President of the Moscow Chess Federation, told Russian news agency TASS (translation via Google Translate).
- Said Lazarev: “The robot was rented by us, it has been exhibited in many places, for a long time, with specialists. Apparently, the operators overlooked it. The child made a move, and after that we need to give time for the robot to answer, but the boy hurried, the robot grabbed him. We have nothing to do with the robot.”
- It’s not clear what explanation —if any — the robot’s creators have offered for this accident, but such incidents are not unusual in scenarios where robot engineers have failed to properly consider safety protocol around humans.
- In most industrial environments, robots are essentially unseeing operators. They move along set paths at set times, and often lack sensors to recognize or respond to nearby humans. In other words: if you move into their path, they won’t know you’re there.
- Many robots operate blind — this one shouldn’t have
- This sort of blind collision has been the cause of many robot fatalities. The first such incident is generally thought to have taken place in 1979, when Ford factory worker Robert Williams was crushed by a robot arm. The US Department of Labor logs these deaths, which tally roughly one fatality a year, though the statistics vary based on different companies’ definition of a robot. For example, is a conveyer belt a robot? Or a molding machine?
- In the case of the chess robot, it seems the device was designed only to identify and move chess pieces — not respond to the appearance of a human hand in its playing area.
- “There are certain safety rules and the child, apparently, violated them. When he made his move, he did not realize he first had to wait,” Sergey Smagin, vice-president of the Russian Chess Federation, told a Telegram-based news channel Baza, according to The Guardian.
- However, it’s more accurate to say that the robot’s designers violated safety rules by creating a machine that could inadvertently hurt humans. A number of basic features could have prevented the accident — from placing a camera above the chess board that disables the robot’s movement if foreign objects appear in frame, to limiting the force that can be output by the robot’s arm.
- Although footage of the incident is distressing, according to Lazarev the child was soon recovered enough to continue to play. “The child played the very next day, finished the tournament in a cast, and the volunteers helped to record the moves,” Lazarev told TASS. “The robot operators, apparently, will have to think about strengthening protection so that this situation does not happen again.”
