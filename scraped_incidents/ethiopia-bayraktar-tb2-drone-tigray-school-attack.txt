- Washington Post analysis appears to show that Ethiopia's government used a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone in January 2022 to attack civilians sheltering in a school during its 16-month conflict with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).
- Reports say at least 59 civilians died and 30 were wounded, including children, during the strike.
- According to the Post's report, remnants of weapons recovered from the school by aid workers showed 'internal components and screw configurations matched images of Turkish-made MAM-L munitions'. MAM-L weaponry pair exclusively with Bayraktar TB2 drones.
- Run by Turkey president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s son-in-law Selçuk Bayraktar, Baykar has supplied Ukraine, Poland, Qatar, Libya, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia and Azerbaijan with armed autonomous drones.
- Bayraktar TB2 drones have been used to deadly effect by Ukraine's air force during Russia's invasion of the eastern European country.

- The Tigray War[b] was an armed conflict that lasted from 3 November 2020[a] to 3 November 2022.[49][50] The war was primarily fought in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia between the Ethiopian federal government and Eritrea on one side, and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) on the other.[51][52]
- After years of increased tensions and hostilities between the TPLF and the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea, fighting began when Tigrayan security forces attacked the Northern Command headquarters of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF), alongside a number of other bases in Tigray.[53] The ENDF counterattacked from the south – while Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) began launching attacks from the north – which Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed described as "law enforcement operations."[54][55] Federal allied forces captured Mekelle, the capital of the Tigray Region, on 28 November, after which Abiy declared the operation "over."[56][57] However, the TPLF stated soon afterwards that it would continue fighting until the "invaders" were out,[58][59] and on 28 June 2021, the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF) retook Mekelle; by July the same year, they had also advanced into the Amhara and Afar regions.[60] In early November 2021, the TDF, together with the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), took control of several towns on the highway south from Tigray Region towards Addis Ababa, and the TPLF stated that it considered "marching on [the capital]."[61][62] Together with seven smaller rebel groups, the TPLF and OLA declared a coalition aiming to "dismantle Abiy's government by force or by negotiations, and then form a transitional authority."[63]
- After a successful government counter-offensive in response, and then a series of negotiations with the TPLF, Ethiopia declared an indefinite humanitarian truce on 24 March 2022, in order to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid into Tigray.[64] However, fighting dramatically re-escalated in late August 2022, after peace talks broke down.[65] Rapid mobilization of troops soon followed, with Ethiopia, Eritrea and Tigray reportedly organizing hundreds of thousands of troops against each other by October the same year.[30] After a number of peace and mediation proposals in the intervening years, Ethiopia and the Tigrayan rebel forces agreed to a cessation of hostilities on 2 November, which went into effect the day after;[50] Eritrea was not a party to the agreement, however, and their status has remained unclear.[66]
- All sides, particularly the ENDF, EDF, and TDF, have committed war crimes during the conflict.[67][68][69][70] Mass extrajudicial killings of civilians have taken place throughout, including in Axum,[71] Bora,[72] Chenna,[73][74] Kobo,[75][76] the Hitsats refugee camp,[77] Humera,[78] Mai Kadra,[69][79] the Debre Abay monastery,[72][80] and Zalambessa.[81] An estimated 385,000–⁠600,000 people have been killed,[44] and war rape became a "daily" occurrence, with girls as young as 8 and women as old as 72 being raped, often in front of their families.[82][83] A major humanitarian crisis has developed as a result of the war,[41] with famine becoming widespread.[84][43] It also inflicted immense economic damage on the region, with the cost of rebuilding alone estimated to be roughly $20 billion.[85][86][87]
- Following the end of the Ethiopian Civil War in 1991, Ethiopia became a dominant-party state under the rule of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition of four ethnically based parties dominated by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).[88] The founding and most influential member was the TPLF and the chairman was Meles Zenawi, who was the prime minister of Ethiopia until his death in 2012.[89][90] He was succeeded by Deputy Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, the chairman of the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM), a coalition member.[91] On 15 February 2018, Hailemariam announced his resignation as both prime minister and chairman of the EPRDF, owing to a growing discontent within the public, fueled by a reaction to 27 years of repression.[92][93][94]
- On 28 March 2018, in a closed-door election to chair the EPRDF, executive committee members elected the Oromo Peoples' Democratic Organisation (OPDO) chairman Abiy Ahmed.[95] On 2 April 2018, Ethiopian parliament elected Abiy as prime minister.[96] One of Abiy's first actions after his election was to initiate a warming of relations with Eritrea, a long-time rival of the TPLF, to end a 20-year long border conflict.[97] While this decision was considered a cause of celebration at the time,[98][99] many within the Tigray Region were heavily critical of this, seeing it as a betrayal of those who died in the 1998–2000 war.[100] The TPLF condemned the peace initiatives, saying they were hastily made, had "fundamental flaws," and also claimed it was decided on without consulting long-time TPLF members.[101]
- On 1 December 2019, Abiy merged the ethnic and region-based parties of the EPRDF (which had governed Ethiopia for 28 years) and several opposition parties into his new Prosperity Party.[102][103] The TPLF, which had long dominated Ethiopian politics, refused to join this new party.[104][105] After losing the election and being ousted from the federal government, TPLF officials relocated to the Tigray Region, continuing to administer control there while frequently clashing with the federal government.[88][106] In one instance, the Tigray regional government was reported to have defied the federal government and refused to allow Ethiopian Federal Police to arrest Getachew Assefa, the former chief of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) of Ethiopia and executive member of the TPLF.[107]
- The Ethiopian government and its supporters have accused the TPLF of trying to re-establish their rule over the country through violence and force.[108] In turn, the TPLF has accused the federal government of accumulating too much power for itself, and that it was engaging in ethnic discrimination of Tigrayans.[109][110]
- Throughout 2020, tensions between the federal government and the TPLF escalated in the months leading up to November.[105] In March, the National Election Board of Ethiopia delayed the general elections – originally scheduled for 29 August 2020 – to a then-undetermined date, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[111] The terms of federal and regional lawmakers, as well as the executive branch, were then extended by federal parliament beyond the October 2020 constitutional mandates.[112][113]
- The TPLF, led by its chairman Debretsion Gebremichael, rejected these measures, arguing that they were unconstitutional, and held its own regional election on 9 September, in defiance of the federal government.[114][115][116] Several journalists were barred by the Ethiopian government from travelling to cover Tigray's regional election.[117][118] Ethiopia considered the Tigray election to be illegal, and responded by slashing federal funding to the region, a decision the TPLF described as "tantamount to declaration of war."[119][53]
- In late September 2020, the TPLF stated that the constitutional term limit of the House of Federation, the House of Peoples' Representatives, the prime minister, and the Council of Ministers was 5 October 2020 and that for this reason, it would consider "the incumbent" constitutionally illegitimate after 5 October; they proposed replacing the government with a technocratic caretaker government, as detailed in a plan posted on Facebook by the Coalition of Ethiopian Federalist Forces.[120] Ethiopian elite units were transported to Gherghera base near Asmara, as part of an alleged pact between Prime Minister Abiy and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki to "strike out of existence the TPLF," according to former Eritrean Minister of Defence Mesfin Hagos.[121]
- In late October 2020, the Ethiopian Reconciliation Commission stated that it was trying to mediate between the federal government and the TPLF, as well as the other regional governments, but that the pre-conditions set by all sides were blocking progress.[122] As tension continued to grow, a brigadier general appointed by Abiy was prevented by the Tigray government from taking up his military post.[123] The same day before the Tigray forces launched the Northern Command attacks, the federal parliament of Ethiopia had suggested designating the TPLF as a terrorist organization.[105]
- The 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia states in Article 39.1, "Every Nation, Nationality, and People in Ethiopia has an unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession." Article 62.9 grants the House of Federation the right to "order Federal intervention if any State [government], in violation of [the] Constitution, endangers the constitutional order."[124]
- Just before midnight on 3 November 2020, Tigray Special Forces and allied local militia attacked the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) Northern Command headquarters in Mekelle, the Fifth Battalion barracks in Dansha, and other Northern Command bases.[125][126][47][105] Several people were killed and the TPLF claimed the attack was carried out in self-defence[127][107] or preemptive self-defense.[53]
- In retaliation,[128] an Ethiopian offensive was launched on 4 November, which was accompanied by the declaration of a state of emergency, the creation of the State of Emergency Inquiry Board[129] and a shutdown of government services in the Tigray Region.[130][131] During the subsequent days, skirmishes continued and the Ethiopian federal parliament declared the creation of an interim government for Tigray.[132] Ethiopian offensives in the north were accompanied with airstrikes and several towns and cities were retaken.[133]
- On the night of 9 to 10 November 2020, 600 civilians, mostly Amharas and Welkait, were killed in a massacre in the town of Mai Kadra with machetes and knives used by local militias and police loyal to the TPLF, according to preliminary investigations by Amnesty International and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission;[134][69] other refugees, interviewed by the Financial Times and Reuters, said it was the Amhara militia who were the perpetrators and Tigrayans who were the victims.[135][136] Two days later, refugees interviewed by the Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and The New York Times stated that Amhara militias, including Fano,[137][138] and the ENDF[78] carried out beatings and massacres of 92 Tigrayans in Humera.[139] Humera was shelled from the direction of the Eritrean–Ethiopian border for two days around 9–11 November. The ENDF gained control of the town one day later.[140]
- Offensives of joint ENDF-Amhara Region-Eritrean forces into Tigray were facilitated by the intervention of "Pterosaurus" drones, launched by the United Arab Emirates from its base in Assab, Eritrea. The Chinese-made, armed drones bombed Tigrayan artillery and weapons depots.[141][142][c][143] In the late hours of 13 November 2020, Tigray forces fired a rocket towards the airports of Bahir Dar and Gondar in the Amhara Region.[144] On 14 November, Tigray forces launched rockets at the Eritrean capital of Asmara, but the missiles missed.[145] The Tigray government claimed these locations contained military terminals that served as bases to carry out airstrikes.[146]
- From 17 to 19 November, Ethiopian forces captured the Raya district and the towns of Shire, Alamata, Adwa, and Axum,[147][148] and began moving towards Adigrat.[149] Fighting between Tigray and Eritrea took place in Adi Quala, Zalembesa, Taruna, Ali Tina, Wadqomdi, and Badme.[150] On 23 November, Ethiopian forces reached the regional capital of Mekelle and encircled it. A military spokesperson for Ethiopia, Colonel Dejene Tsegaye, announced that Mekelle would be shelled, and told Tigray civilians to flee the city because Ethiopian forces would show no mercy.[151][127]
- Though TPLF leaders and special forces had already left the city, Ethiopian forces continued their direct assault on Mekelle on the morning of 28 November, and started heavily shelling the city. By the evening, Prime Minister Abiy declared Ethiopian forces had taken full control of the city. In total, 27 civilians were killed and 100 others were injured.[67][152] The Tigray government vowed to continue fighting.[58][153]
- After Ethiopian federal forces and their allies captured Mekelle and other major cities, forces loyal to the Tigray government began to regroup into mountainous areas of the region and reorganized under the banner of the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF).[154][53] This retreat was partially caused by the fact that a large portion of the TDF's artillery had been destroyed by air strikes.[155] The TDF also began to dig into their positions in rural Tigray,[156] marking the start of a guerrilla campaign against Ethiopian-allied forces from the mountains.[53]
- On 28 and 29 November, witnesses and survivors, including refugees in Sudan, reported that the Eritrean Defence Forces (EDF) carried out the Axum massacre of about 720 to 800 civilians.[71][157][158][159] The Eritrean government stated that it was angered by Amnesty International's report on the massacre, calling it "transparently unprofessional" and "politically motivated" and accusing Amnesty of fabricating evidence.[160] However, refugees also spoke of the EDF killing 80–150 people in Idaga Hamus on 30 November, as part of a larger series of extrajudicial killings known as the Adigrat massacres.[161]
- A witness told Al Jazeera that, on 4 December, Eritrean troops entered her town in southeastern Tigray and attempted to rape her; this statement is corroborated by other survivors and witnesses, who spoke of rampant sexual violence, massacres and destruction of civilian infrastructure committed by the EDF.[162]
- In February 2021, the UN chief coordinator of humanitarian efforts Mark Lowcock said that up to 40% of Tigray was not controlled by Ethiopian troops. Aside from Tigrayan rebel forces, he said that much of that area was under the control of the EDF, pursuing their own objectives independent of Ethiopian command.[163] By early March, residents said that the number of Eritrean soldiers in Tigray was in the thousands.[162]
- By mid-December, fighting had reached Hagere Selam, Samre, Dogu'a, Kolla Tembien, May Tsemre and localities around Maychew.[164] During this time, a violently enforced curfew was set up by Ethiopian forces along with Eritrean soldiers.[164] According to the Europe External Programme with Africa (EEPA), in Wukro over 200 people were killed and the town was left deserted. The Ethiopian government denied involvement in the killing.[164]
- On 9 January 2021, Ethiopian TV reported that 300 refugees in Hitsats camp were executed by the TPLF.[77] According to refugees, pro-TPLF forces used Hitsats as a base for several weeks in November 2020, killing several refugees who wanted to leave the camp to get food and, in one incident, killed nine young Eritrean men in revenge for having lost a battle against the EDF.[165] On 18 February, unidentified militiamen ambushed a passenger bus in Adi Mesino, killing six and injuring 10.[166]
- Ultimately, the early gains made by the ENDF and EDF against Tigrayan forces did not lead to a decisive defeat of the re-organized and invigorated TDF.[167] In late January, the TDF had rallied and were intensifying their insurgency against Ethiopian forces despite the initial setbacks and heavy losses.[154] During this time fighting was reported to have taken place around Mekelle, and the ENDF had retreated from rural positions towards the city.[168] Several of these clashes took place in mid-February at Samre, a small town 45 km (28 mi) south-west of Mekelle. Thousands of Ethiopian troops supported by artillery, tanks, and airstrikes fought dug-in forces loyal to the Tigray regional government.[154]
- According to a report by Ghent University, massacres of civilians continued into March, including around 250 in Humera over the course of three days by unconfirmed perpetrators, and 13 in Grizana by the EDF.[169] That same month, an undated video surfaced that purported to show Ethiopian troops executing 11 unarmed men before throwing their bodies off a cliff near Mahibere Dego.[170]
- Fighting intensified in early April;[154] by this point, the TDF was in control of the rural areas of central and southern Tigray along with parts of eastern and south-eastern Tigray, while the ENDF was in control of the main roads and urban areas. Amhara and Eritrean forces also controlled parts of Tigray in the west and north, respectively. All sides wished to secure a military victory, but they lacked the ability to do so in the near term, and so they began to prepare for a prolonged conflict.[156] The Tigray Defense Forces were engaged in a war of attrition with popular support from the people of Tigray, who were infuriated by war crimes committed by Eritrean and Ethiopian soldiers and worried about a potential decrease in the region's autonomy.[171][53] This resulted in the TDF growing in strength and the concept of secession from Ethiopia gaining popularity in Tigray, a stance which was considered likely to inflame Amhara-Tigray territorial disputes.[156]
- On 6 May, Ethiopia's House of Peoples' Representatives declared the TPLF as a terrorist organization.[172] On 21 May, Ethiopia's military prosecutors convicted 3 soldiers of rape and pressed charges against over 50 others suspected of killing civilians in Tigray or committing rape and other forms of sexual violence.[173] The statement also confirmed reports of two massacres in Tigray, stating that 229 civilians were killed in the town of Mai Kadra at the beginning of November 2020, and accusing Eritrean forces of killing 110 civilians in Axum later that same month.[173][174]
- On 22 June 2021, an Ethiopian military cargo plane was shot down over Samre, marking a turn of the war in the TDF's favor.[175] On 28 June 2021, the Tigray Defense Forces retook the city of Mekelle. People celebrated in the streets of Mekelle as the TDF took the city.[176][177] Ethiopian soldiers, police and administrators were seen leaving, ahead of the occupation by the TDF. Shortly after hearing news of the TDF advance, the Ethiopian government declared an immediate unilateral ceasefire across the Tigray Region.[178] BBC News reporter Vivienne Nunis characterised the ceasefire as an attempt by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to save face, the government having little other option.[179]
- On 29 June, Tigrayan forces vowed to continue their offensive and drive into Eritrea or the Amhara Region if necessary, and said that Mekelle was 100% under the control of Tigrayan forces.[180] On 30 June 2021, the TDF had entered the town of Shire, some 140 kilometres (87 mi) northwest of Mekelle, after it had been abandoned by Eritrean troops. The International Crisis Group claimed that the TDF now controlled most of the Tigray region.[179] The Ethiopian government claimed, on 30 June, that it could re-enter Mekelle in less than three weeks if it wanted to. In the same announcement, the Ethiopian government stated that all Eritrean forces had withdrawn from the region, though this was not confirmed by the Eritrean government.[181]
- On 6 July 2021, the Tigrayan government mobilised to retake western Tigray from Amhara forces.[182] A TDF offensive starting on 12 July resulted in Tigrayan forces capturing southern Tigray, including the towns of Alamata and Korem.[183] The TDF subsequently crossed the Tekezé River and advanced westward, capturing the town of Mai Tsebri in the Tselemti district, and prompting Amhara officials to call on its militias to arm themselves and mobilise.[184] Following the TDF's rapid advances, Abiy threatened to resume war with Tigray and crush the rebels, raising fears of genocide.[185] He called on other regions of Ethiopia to mobilise their special forces. The Oromia, Sidama, and SNNPR regions answered the call and mobilised.[186]
- From 17 to 19 July, the TDF began launching attacks in the Afar Region to its east, prompting the Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambela, Harari and Somali regions to join the war.[2] Heavy fighting in western Afar displaced over 54,000 people, and resulted in the TDF reportedly capturing three districts in the region.[187]
- While the Tigray government claimed it only entered Afar to target federal forces, experts believe their aim was to sever a portion of National Highway A1, a vital trade route for landlocked Ethiopia, linking the capital of Addis Ababa to the Port of Djibouti, from which most of its petroleum products are imported.[188][189] Following the TDF's counter-attack on two districts of his region, the Amhara regional President, Agegnehu Teshager, called for the total mobilisation of all people of all ages who are armed in the region to fight against the Tigrayans. A similar call was made in Afar.[3] Meanwhile, the city of Weldiya was captured by the TDF on 12 August 2021.[190]
- On 4 August 2021, some Agew people declared themselves independent from the Amhara Region and formed the Agew Liberation Front (ALF).[191] The next day, Lalibela was reported to have been seized by Tigrayan forces.[192][193] On 9 August, UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore expressed concern about reports that over 200 people, including 100 children, had been killed in attacks on displaced families sheltering at a health facility and a school in the Afar Region.[194] On 11 August, the TDF and the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) announced an alliance to overthrow Abiy Ahmed's government, saying they were also in talks with other rebel groups to establish a "grand coalition."[195] With the TDF advancing deeper into Amhara, various cities across the region began enforcing curfews.[196]
- On 9 September 2021, the Ethiopian government claimed Tigrayan forces had been "routed" and heavily defeated in the Afar Region. Tigrayan spokesperson Getachew Reda said its forces had seen no fighting in Afar and had redeployed to the adjoining Amhara Region.[197] On 30 September, amid UN concerns about a blockade of aid deliveries to Tigray, the Ethiopian government expelled 7 top UN officials, reportedly because of "meddling" in its internal affairs, giving the officials 72 hours to leave the country.[198][199]
- On 8 October 2021, the TPLF said that an intensive air campaign by the Ethiopian Air Force began against TDF positions in the North Wollo and North Gondar zones of the Amhara Region, mostly around the towns of Wegeltena, Wurgessa and Haro.[200] He also stated there was a "massive build up of forces on all fronts."[200] The federal government and Amhara regional government did not respond to the claim.[200] On 11 October, Ethiopian-allied forces launched coordinated ground attacks "on all fronts" against the TDF with combined arms including tanks, helicopters, heavy artillery, warplanes, and drones according to the Tigrayan government.[201][202] General Tsadkan Gebretensae, member of the central command of the TDF said both sides had been preparing for the offensive for months, and predicted that battle would be "decisive."[155]
- The new offensive effectively ended the unilateral ceasefire declared by the federal government in June[203] and further deepened fears of the developing famine in Tigray, with a federal government blockade still preventing most aid from arriving.[155] Meanwhile, the continued war prompted regional leaders, including Kenyan President Kenyatta, to voice their concerns and urge peace, while US Secretary of State Blinken met with the AU envoy to Ethiopia, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, to discuss the crisis.[155]
- On 13 October, Getachew claimed fighting continued intensifying with "staggering" casualties. He also claimed clashes were taking place near Weldiya and that fighting had resumed in Afar, within the Awra and Chifra districts near the Amhara border.[204][205] A humanitarian worker citing witnesses said the EDF were fighting the TDF in Berhale, a town in Afar 71 kilometres (44 mi) northeast of Mekelle.[205]
- On 30 October, it was reported that Dessie had fallen to the TDF. However, control over the city was not immediately certain, with the federal government denying its capture and reports of fierce fighting coming from the town.[206] On 31 October, the TDF claimed to have captured Kombolcha, a town 21 km (13 mi) east of Dessie, and the Ethiopian government accused the TDF of massacring over 100 youths in the town.[207] On the same day, the Amhara regional government declared a state of emergency, which included a region-wide curfew.[208]
- South of Kombolcha, the OLA claimed to have seized control over Kemise on the A2 Highway which links Mekelle to the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa,[61] and later declared they were considering an offensive towards the capital.[62] The TDF claimed they also linked up with the OLA.[209] Meanwhile, it was reported that a new roundup of ethnic Tigrayans had occurred in Addis Ababa.[209]
- On 2 November 2021, as the counter-offensive came deeper into federal-controlled territory, the Ethiopian government declared a six-month state of emergency, which envisages the possibility to arrest and detain critics of the government without a court warrant, impose curfews, institute censorship, restrict freedom of movement as well as to call any adult person to fight in the war, for fear of serving from three to ten years in prison.[210][211] Authorities in Addis Ababa also told residents to register their weapons in order to fend off the anticipated offensive. Four other regional governments also made a call to arms.[212][62] On 5 November, the TPLF, OLA and other rebel groups declared the creation of a nine-group coalition, called the United Front of Ethiopian Federalist and Confederalist Forces.[213]
- On 22 November, Prime Minister Abiy stated that he will be leading the fight against the rebels from the battlefront after the TDF claimed to have captured Shewa Robit,[214][215] saying; "We are now in the final stages of saving Ethiopia."[216] Many countries also urged citizens to leave the country.[216]
- From 26 November to 6 December 2021, Ethiopian allied forces recaptured several towns in the Amhara and Afar regions including Lalibela and Shewa Robit, according to the Ethiopian government.[217][218][219][220] On 6 December, government forces claimed to have recaptured the strategic cities of Dessie and Kombolcha.[221] This was later confirmed by TPLF spokesman Getachew Reda; however, he claimed this was a strategic withdrawal, which was "part of their plan."[222] On 12 December, Reuters reported that forces loyal to the TPLF had recaptured the town of Lalibela less than two weeks after government forces and their allies had recaptured control of the town for themselves.[223] Nevertheless, by the end of the month, the federal government had successfully repelled the incursion towards Addis Ababa, and Tigrayan forces were pushed back to Tigray.
- On 20 December 2021, the TPLF announced they had withdrawn their troops from Amhara and Afar, saying they were hoping to create, as stated by TPLF chairman Debretsion Gebremichael, "a decisive opening for peace." Debretsion also requested the establishment of a no-fly zone over Tigray, as well as a weapons embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea.[224][225] Following these developments, the ENDF stated that it would not advance any deeper into the Tigray region.[226] However, in January 2022, the Ethiopian Air Force began launching a bombing campaign in the Tigray Region, killing 108 people, including at least 56 from an airstrike targeting an IDP camp in Dedebit.[227][228]
- On 7 January – the same day as the Dedebit airstrike – Ethiopia released a number of opposition leaders from prison, including some from the TPLF, and said they desired to have a dialogue with the Tigrayan leadership.[229] On 26 January, the Ethiopian council of ministers also proposed to end the state of emergency.[230]
- On 24 March 2022, the Ethiopian government declared an indefinite humanitarian truce, in order to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid into Tigray.[64] During the ceasefire, both Ethiopia and the TPLF agreed to have talks about an official end to the war. A number of outstanding issues – in particular, the presence of pro-government troops in Tigray's Western Zone and restoring access to basic public service to Tigray – were topics of discussion throughout.[231][232] Though there were initial hopes of finding a peaceful solution to ending the war, the talks soon became characterized by steadily increasing hostilities between the negotiation parties.[233] By August, talks started to break down, with both the Ethiopian government and the TPLF accusing each other of refusing to make peace.[234][235]
- In late August 2022, after months of ceasefire, fighting resumed. Both sides blamed each other for initiating the fighting, and both also expressed frustration "for a lack of progress towards negotiations to end the 21-month conflict."[65] The fighting itself concentrated in the border area connecting Tigray, Amhara and Afar. Allegations emerged that the Tigray were smuggling in weapons, leading to the Ethiopian Air Force shooting down a plane, claiming it was carrying weapons for the TPLF; meanwhile, the government was accused of indiscriminate air bombardments on civilian targets.[236] Civilians reported that pro-government militias, such as FANO, had gotten involved as well.[237] Exacerbating tensions were severe food shortages, an issue that remained unsolved have particularly affected the Tigray region.[238][237][239]
- On 27 August, the TDF captured the town of Kobo, following the ENDF's withdrawal.[240] Ethiopia and Eritrea subsequently announced an offensive in North Tigray on 1 September.[241] On 13 September 2022, the TPLF said Eritrea had taken Sheraro.[242] The town's capture by Eritrea and the fighting in nearby areas displaced around 210,000 people, most of whom fled to the city of Shire.[243] A day later Ethiopian airstrikes on Mekelle killed at least ten people.[244] By mid-September, reports emerged of Eritrea engaging in mass mobilization of the country's reservists to be sent to Tigray.[245]
- On 20 September, the government of Tigray said Eritrea had invaded the region, and that heavy fighting was taking place across northern Tigray.[246][247][248] The TDF had, thus far, largely resisted the offensive, and reportedly launched a counterattack to retake Sheraro. Meanwhile, Ethiopian and Eritrean forces began massing in Abala and Berhale in the Afar Region, within striking distance of Mekelle.[249] On September 27, an airstrike – allegedly carried out by Eritrea – struck the northern town of Adi Dairo while it was celebrating Meskel, killing at least six civilians and injured 19 more.[250] On 2 October, the TPLF announced it had withdrawn troops from Amhara's North Wollo Zone, including Kobo, to be redeployed north to reinforce lines under heavy Eritrean attack but warned it would return if their southern border is threatened.[251] Three days later, a second airstrike hit Adi Dairo, killing between 50 and 65 people according to aid workers in the town.[252]
- On 10 October, the TPLF claimed that Eritrea was escalating its offensive, sending more forces towards Rama, Tserona, and Zalambessa in the far north, with one aid worker saying it is the heaviest fighting since hostilities resumed.[253] Later reports confirmed that Eritrea was intensifying its efforts to mobilize more troops for the war; it detained "elderly mothers and fathers," and sought draft-dodgers.[254] Tigray mobilized its citizens too, calling on every able-bodied person to join the fight.[255] Amidst the three-front offensive launched by Ethiopia and Eritrea, estimates put the number of Ethiopian casualties at over 90,000 in a single month, while Tigrayan casualties were also deemed incredibly high.[256] According to peace and conflict studies researcher Kjetil Tronvoll, it is likely that 100,000 people had been killed over the preceding few weeks, and alleged that Eritrea and Ethiopia were using human wave attacks to overwhelm Tigrayan defenses.[257]
- On 17 October, Ethiopia said that it would seize every airport and other key infrastructure in the region;[258] that same day, the strategic city of Shire was taken by Eritrea and Ethiopia, leading to the evacuation of thousands of its inhabitants.[259][260] Ethiopian forces then took Alamata and Korem in the south.[261] By 22 October, ENDF and EDF-allied forces had also captured Adwa and Axum, even as peace talks with the TPLF were about to commence in South Africa.[262][263][264] Witnesses from a number of towns told the Associated Press that Eritrean forces were regularly killing civilians between 23 and 29 October.[265]
- On 25 October 2022, AU Commission Chairperson, Moussa Faki, announced that peace talks involving the Ethiopian government and the TPLF had commenced in Pretoria, South Africa.[109][266] Hopes that these talks could definitively stop the war, however, remained low, as fighting did not appear to slow down, and Ethiopia vocalized their distrust about the peace process.[110][267] Still, negotiations continued onward, and on 2 November, Ethiopia and the TPLF announced that they had signed an agreement for a cessation of hostilities (made effective the next day on 3 November, marking the two-year anniversary of the war);[50] however, Eritrea and other warring parties were not involved in the agreement, leaving their status ambiguous.[66] On 12 November, both parties signed a deal to allow humanitarian aid into Tigray.[268] By 29 December, federal police were reported to have returned to Tigray,[269] while flights and internet access had also been restored.[270]
- Despite important steps towards peace and deescalation being made between the government and the TPLF, Amhara and Eritrean forces continued to launch attacks on Tigrayans throughout November and December.[271][272][273] From 17 to 25 November alone, Eritrea was reported to have destroyed 241 houses and killed at least 111 people.[274]
- The intensity of the war has led to spillover effects on the surrounding countries in the region, especially in Sudan.
- By the end of November 2020, thousands of people were believed to have been killed in the conflict and around 44,000 fled to Sudan. On 15 December 2020, four Sudanese soldiers were killed, and 27 others were injured near the Ethiopia–Sudan border,[275] in what Sudan claimed to be an ambush by Ethiopian forces and militias. A Sudanese soldier later claimed that Ethiopian forces had launched artillery attacks on them and intruded into the Jebel al-Teyyour area, located 7 kilometres inside Sudan. Other soldiers claimed that the attackers were Amhara Region militias. Ethiopia claimed the clashes were Ethiopia trying to stop a Sudanese militia which had tried to cross into Ethiopian territory and seize farmlands. In response to the killings, Sudan started to build up its military along the border with Ethiopia.[276][277][278]
- Since the war began, both regional and international powers have been actively involved in the conflict. A number of reports have been made alleging that China, Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates were all providing military support for the Ethiopian government via the sale of weaponized drones.[11][279][280][281][282] As early as December 2020, there were unconfirmed rumors that Emirati drones were being stationed in the Eritrean port city of Assab.[283] The victory of Ethiopian forces over Dessie and Kombolcha in December 2021 was partly due to the drones supplied by Ethiopia's allies.[citation needed] In Debretsion Gebremichael's order to withdraw all his forces from Tigray borders in December 2021, he mentioned "the drones provided by foreign powers" as a major factor that prompted his decision.[280]
- There have been multiple unconfirmed reports of Somali troops being sent from a secret training base in Eritrea run by the National Intelligence and Security Agency to fight against the newly formed TDF.[153] The first of these reports came in January 2021 from unverified social media accounts.[161] The same month, Somalia's information minister, Osman Abukar Dubbe, confirmed Somali soldiers were training in Eritrea, but denied any of these troops had been sent to Tigray. According to the Voice of America, several sources with direct knowledge of the program, including three Somali officials and a foreign diplomat, confirmed to them that Somali troops have been training in neighbouring Eritrea.[161] In January 2022, The Globe and Mail reported evidence of Somali troops were involved and they had committed atrocities in Tigray. The report noted that before the war began, Somali forces under the leadership of the Eritrean Army had been stationed in trenches along the border.[284]
- A small group of parents also protested in Mogadishu about what they said was the government's mismanagement of the issue. They demanded information on their loved ones who they say they haven't seen in a year.[161][153] The head of Somalia's parliamentary committee on foreign affairs asked the Somali president to investigate claims by family members that their sons had gone off to fight in Ethiopia and are now missing.[285] On 19 January 2021, the Somali government denied the claim that Somali troops had trained in Eritrea and then deployed in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia.[286][287]
- Former head of the Somali National Intelligence and Security Agency, Abdilsalan Guld,[288] claimed that Somali troops were sent to Tigray. Guld stated that the soldiers, aged from 20 to 30 years old, were secretly taken from Mogadishu and sent to Asmara for military training. Guld stated that 370 of the Somali troops trained by Eritrea were killed in Tigray, and hundreds of others were wounded.[289][287]
- All sides in the conflict have been accused of violating international human rights law, with evidence of unlawful killings, torture and sexual violence being committed.[291][292][293][294] As of late 2022, the combined impact of wartime violence, famine and a lack of medical access had killed an estimated 385,000-600,000 people,[44] with other reported estimates reaching numbers as high as 700,000-800,000 killed.[30]
- Many sources have accused the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments of engaging in crimes against humanity via ethnic cleansing of Tigrayans.[295][296][297] The Ethiopian and Eritrean governments have also been accused of genocide.[298][299][300][301] According to the EU's special envoy to Ethiopia, Pekka Haavisto, senior members of the Ethiopian government called for "wip[ing] out" all Tigrayans for 100 years.[302][303][304] The Ethiopian Government denied the allegations.[305]
- On 4 June 2021, the non-profit Genocide Watch classified the events in Tigray as step 9 of genocide (eradication), as well as step 10 (denial).[306] They issued another emergency alert on 20 November 2021, stating that "both sides are committing genocide," referring to detentions of thousands of people based on Oromo or Tigrayan ethnic identity, and arguing that "Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's hate speech and calls for war" together with attacks by the ENDF and TPLF put Ethiopia into stages 4 (dehumanization), 6 (polarization), 8 (persecution), and 9 (extermination) of the ten stages of genocide.[307]
- Ethnic profiling against Tigrayans occurred during the Tigray War, with Ethiopians of Tigrayan ethnicity being put on indefinite leave from Ethiopian Airlines or refused permission to board,[308] prevented from overseas travel,[309] and an "order of identifying ethnic Tigrayans from all government agencies and NGOs" being used by federal police to request a list of ethnic Tigrayans from an office of the World Food Programme.[310] Tigrayans' houses were arbitrarily searched and Tigrayans' bank accounts suspended.[309] During the conflict, many Tigrayans were profiled both professionally and socially, with many fired or called names when out in public as a result of the conflict, such as Tigrayan military members having their weapons confiscated or dismissed from duty.[311] A hotspot for this form of profiling took place in Addis Ababa, including disappearances of major Ethiopian officials and arrests of Tigrayans on the grounds that they supported the TPLF, which was designated as a terrorist organisation in May 2021 by Ethiopian parliament.[312]
- Ethnic Tigrayan members of Ethiopian components of United Nations peacekeeping missions were disarmed and some forcibly flown back to Ethiopia, at the risk of torture or execution, according to United Nations officials. The State of Emergency Taskforce stated that the Tigrayan peacekeepers were returned to Ethiopia because of "infiltration of TPLF elements in various entities."[313][314] On 1 November 2021, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed stated that "we should closely follow those who work for the enemy and live amongst us," as reports of a new roundup of ethnic Tigrayans came out of Addis Ababa.[209]
- Wartime rape and sexual violence was also widespread, being perpetrated by virtually all sides.[315] There were "deeply distressing reports of sexual and gender-based violence, extrajudicial killings, [and the] widespread destruction and looting of public and private property by all parties" according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. More than 136 cases of rape were reported in hospitals in Mekelle, Ayder, Adigrat and Wukro in eastern Tigray between December 2020 and January 2021, with indications that there are many more such unreported cases.[316] As of August 2021, there were 512 to 514 rape victims registered with Ethiopian hospitals;[317][318] however, the real number is probably much larger than that and can be as large as 120,000 by some estimations,[319] and many sources believe the sexual violence in Tigray was intentionally committed with the purpose of destroying the morale of the enemy, to genocide and genetically cleanse certain populations, and to spread STIs as a form of biological warfare.[320][315][318][321]
- Often, soldiers, and militias subjected Tigrayan women and girls, including pregnant women and young girls, to rape, gang rape, sexual slavery, sexual mutilation, and other forms of sexual torture.[322][323] Such sexual violence is often accompanied with other forms of physical and mental abuse, including burning their victims with hot iron or cigarettes, forcing metal rods or nails into their victim's genitals,[323][315] raping their victim in front of their family members, forcing their victims to rape their family members, calling their victims by derogatory words and ethnic slurs, etc.[324][323]  There were also reports that Tigrayan forces had gang-raped dozens of women and underage girls in at least two towns in the Amhara Region,[325] and girls – some as young as 14 – were identified as victims of rape in the towns of Chenna and Kobo in August and September 2021.[326][327][328]
- After being subjected to sexual violence, many women become infected with STIs like HIV, who face difficulty getting treatment due to a sense of shame, as well as the collapse of medical infrastructure caused by the war.[322]
- There have been several reported attacks on humanitarian workers, including attacks by Ethiopian government soldiers.[329][330][331][332] The Danish Refugee Council and the International Rescue Committee reported killings of their staff in early December 2020.[332] Although the Ethiopian federal government claimed to have given "full and unhindered access for humanitarian actors to operate in all parts of the region," many humanitarian agencies reported having been repulsed at army checkpoints and blocked from entry to various regions. There were accusations by US officials that armed forces were specifically singling out humanitarian workers for an attack.[333]
- On 23 March 2021, a driver from Médecins Sans Frontières was beaten by Ethiopian soldiers after witnessing extrajudicial killings by Ethiopian government soldiers.[329] Following the 23 June bombing of Togoga, there were reports of Ethiopian government soldiers firing on ambulances to prevent them from reaching the injured.[334] On 25 June 2021, three Médecins Sans Frontières workers were found murdered near their car in Tigray.[335][336]
- Investigations into the war crimes include the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) joint investigation,[337] and the ACHPR Tigray investigation by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR).[338][339]
- According to the United Nations (UN), some 2.3 million children have been cut off from desperately needed aid and humanitarian assistance. Since the start of the conflict, the Ethiopian federal government has strictly controlled access to the Tigray Region, and the UN has said it is frustrated that talks with the Ethiopian government had not yet secured adequate humanitarian access for "food, including ready-to-use therapeutic food for the treatment of child malnutrition, medicines, water, fuel, and other essentials that are running low" said UNICEF.[340][341][342][343][344] By 13 March 2021, the UN and its partners reached about 0.9 million people with complete food baskets, and 0.7 million people with clean water. Despite the progress made, many are still hard to reach due to ongoing fighting. About 4.5 million people of are still in need of aid and about 1 million of that are not in accessible areas due to ongoing fighting.[345]
- There has been limited access to clean water due to hygiene and sanitation services largely being disrupted across Tigray. The Tigray Regional Water Bureau reported that out of 36 villages it assessed, only 4 had partially functioning water sources. Along with that, an estimated 250 motorized water pumping systems have been out of order, and the status of 11,000 hand pumps in rural areas was unknown. Because of this, there has been a heightened risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases and COVID-19.[345]
- In February 2021, GOAL Ethiopia, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), MCMDO, MSF-Spain, and World Vision, found that nearly one in seven children in 16 woredas and town administrations across Tigray were acutely malnourished. While in Enderta, Abi Adi and Shire, GOAL and IRC reported that 16.6% of children screened had acute malnutrition with 3.5% suffering from severe acute malnutrition.[345]
- According to the UN, in March 2021, out of more than 260 health centres in Tigray before the war, only 31 were fully functional, while 7 were partially functional. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), all of the functioning hospitals and health centres in Tigray had a lack of medical supplies, drugs, and equipment. UN partners reported continued looting of health facilities. Only 16% of the health facilities had vaccination services and only 17% had maternal services (antenatal care, birth delivery, etc.).[345]
- On 31 August 2021, USAID's mission director in Ethiopia, Sean Jones said: "We do have proof that several of our warehouses have been looted and completely emptied in the areas, particularly in Amhara, where TPLF soldiers have gone into, I do believe that the TPLF has been very opportunistic," in a televised interview with state broadcaster EBC in Addis Ababa.[346][347] All parties to the conflict have been accused by USAID of looting aid shipments.[346]
- By the summer of 2022, the government blockade of essential services to Tigray was still in place, and the humanitarian situation remained severe, with roughly 13 million people being in need of food aid.[348] According to the World Food Programme, while international aid had technically been allowed into the region during the 2022 ceasefire, in practice, very little aid was reaching the people that needed it most, largely due to fuel not being made available in these area.[349][238] On 25 August (one day after the war resumed), the WFP accused the TPLF of stealing 570,000 liters of fuel meant to transport humanitarian aid.[350][351]
- In late October 2022, it was revealed that the Tigray Region was running out of medical supplies, with the CEO of their largest hospital saying it was "doomed to collapse soon."[352][353] WHO officials stated that childhood vaccination rates had plummeted from 90% (before the war) to under 10%.[354] On 29 October, UNICEF reported that around 29.7 million people in Ethiopia were in need of humanitarian assistance.[41]
- In December 2020, the UN estimated more than one million people had been internally displaced by the fighting.[356] More than 50,000 people have fled to Sudan due to the conflict.[357][309] Communications and travel links were still blocked, and Human Rights Watch warned that "actions that deliberately impede relief supplies" would violate international humanitarian law.[356] Possible COVID-19 outbreaks were feared as refugees fleeing the Tigray conflict sheltered in crowded camps.[358] By March 2021, Shire had become a major centre for internally displaced people and humanitarian aid distribution.[359]
- In September 2021, the humanitarian situation continued to worsen in Tigray, Afar and Amhara Regions, due both to the armed conflict itself and due to bureaucratic obstruction. Two thousand displaced people returned to the Fantí Rasu zone in Afar Region after the ENDF and Afar Special Forces regained control and OCHA partner organisations' access to improved.[360]
- UNICEF stated that by the end of September 2022, around 574,000 more people in Afar, Amhara and Tigray were left displaced after fighting resumed in August 2022; they also reported that over 870,000 had become refugees.[41][361]
- In November 2020, the Amhara Region Special Force[362] and Amhara militias loyal to the Amhara regional government[53] took control of the western zone of Tigray in order to settle a decades-old land dispute. They claim the area was taken from them by force in 1992 after TPLF forces overthrew the communist PDRE government and divided the country into ethnic regional states. They have also claimed the woredas (districts) of Welkait, Tegede, Kafta Humera, Tselemti, and Raya to be theirs.[363]
- Since then, the area has been under the de facto control of Amhara regional authorities. Their control has been marked by reports of ethnically motivated violence and forced displacement. By February 2021, about 45,000 civilians had been forced to leave the zone due to extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, and the disappearances of people, especially young men.[362] One refugee interviewed by Reuters said that if they didn't leave when they did, they would have been killed by Amhara forces. 41 other refugees interviewed have also described attacks, looting, and threats by Amhara forces.[364]
- In March 2021, Mulu Nega, then leader of the federal-government-appointed Transitional Government of Tigray, stated that Amhara de facto administrators of Western Tigray used violence against ethnic Tigrayans and forcibly displaced them. Yabsira Eshetie, the administrator of the area, denied the claims. The Amhara government also denied the reports of forced displacement and asked the Ethiopian government to modify the border between the Amhara and Tigray regions. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that there had been acts of ethnic cleansing in Tigray.[364]
- In November 2020, the UN warned of "very critical" supply shortages for the nearly 100,000 Eritrean refugees who, prior to the war, were registered in four camps in Tigray region.[356][365] Later that same month, the UN reported that people in Tigray were fleeing Mekelle. The federal government had warned of "no mercy" if Tigray forces and residents remained intermingled.[356][366] As of 2 February 2021, 20,000 of the Eritrean refugees in Tigray, mostly from the Hitsats and Shimelba camps, remained unaccounted for, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.[367]
- Claire Wilmot, writing in The Washington Post, found that a significant number of new, single-issue Twitter accounts were opened in the immediate aftermath of the Northern Command attacks. Most appeared to be authentic accounts from people seeking to raise international awareness of the conflict in the midst of a communications blackout in Tigray.[368] The Ethiopian government cited disinformation and hate speech to justify communications blackouts. Researchers suggested that reducing access to information could help to create contexts where misinformation can thrive because it reduces the ability to verify information.[368][369] In late July 2021, a report emerged that there was coordination in social media messaging and media reportage of the conflict in Ethiopia, to an extent it mirrored an earlier Syrian hybrid information campaign designated as Project Basma.[370]
- The Ethiopian government tried to control the information environment by positioning itself as the sole provider of reliable information.[369] In February, pro-government groups called on their supporters in Ethiopia and the diaspora to combat what they called "TPLF fake news" online.[371] Pro-government groups used tactics similar to those of pro-Tigray groups to push their narrative of the conflict, though as of 5 February, pro-government campaigns had produced fewer Tweets overall.[369] Both Agence France-Presse and BBC News have documented examples of old or manipulated photos, which misleadingly endorsed either the federal Ethiopian government or the TPLF.[372][373]
- Researchers found that groups use tactics such as "copy and paste" campaigns hosted on websites, which include instructions for opening new accounts, copying and pasting pre-written tweets, and tagging influencers. Both campaigns produced disinformation and misinformation, though the majority of content produced was activist in nature.[369] Wilmot suggested that the lines between authentic political activity and deliberate manipulation of online content during the conflict were increasingly blurred.[368]
- Facebook has been heavily criticized for its perceived role in fuelling ethnic tensions during the war, and has faced accusations that, in choosing not to crack down on hate speech being spread by Ethiopian users, it is complicit in cases of ethnic cleansing in the country.[374][375][376][377][378]
- The Ethiopian government had engaged in repeated crackdowns on media coverage throughout the war.[379] In November 2021 (during the 2021–2022 state of emergency), the Ethiopian Media Authority (EMA) threatened to cancel the media licences of BBC News, Reuters, CNN and Associated Press, accusing the news organisations of having "consistently disseminated news that sowed seeds of animosity among people and compromised the sovereignty of the country." The EMA cited "reporting the Law enforcement operation as a genocidal campaign" as an example of misleading information aiming to "undermin[e] the [federal] government's efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region."[380]
- On 20 May 2022, Ethiopian law enforcement began arresting journalists en masse, with 4,500 people in the Amhara Region alone being taken into custody. One Amhara law enforcement official described this as a way to maintain "law and order" and "get rid of outside enemies."[381]
- The media restrictions resulted in what has been described  as an "information blackout."[382] Many journalists, both local and international, have noted the difficulty they face in trying to report on the war, as they risk the possibility of getting either killed or imprisoned by government forces.[383][384] By December 2021, the Committee to Protect Journalists described both Ethiopia and Eritrea as the worst "jailers of journalists" in sub-Saharan Africa.[385]
- Several proposals for peace negotiations and mediation were made involving some of the main groups involved in the war. Of these, this includes: an emergency Intergovernmental Authority on Development summit in December 2020;[386] a joint statement by the National Congress of Great Tigray, the Tigray Independence Party, and Salsay Weyane Tigray describing their eight pre-conditions for peace in February 2021;[387] a mediation group called "A3+1," (consisting of three African countries, Kenya, Niger and Tunisia, and one non-African country, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) in July–August 2021;[388] and a March–August 2022 ceasefire wherein Ethiopian and Tigrayan officials attempted to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict.[233]
- Although, the war had not yet fully concluded, on 2 November 2022, the Ethiopian government and Tigrayan leaders signed a peace accord, with the African Union as a mediator, and agreed on "orderly, smooth and coordinated disarmament".[389][390] The agreement was made effective the next day on 3 November, marking the two-year anniversary of the war.[50]
- As part of this process, Prime minister Abiy Ahmed appointed TPLF's Getachew Reda as head of the Interim Regional Administration of Tigray and the Ethiopian parliament removed the TPLF from its terrorism list.[391]
- The Tigray War has been the subject of numerous reactions and protests worldwide.

- 
- The Bayraktar TB2 is a medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) capable of remotely controlled or autonomous flight operations. It is manufactured by the Turkish company Baykar Makina Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş., primarily for the Turkish Armed Forces.[3] The aircraft are monitored and controlled by an aircrew in a ground control station, including weapons employment. The development of the UAV has been largely credited to Selçuk Bayraktar, a former MIT graduate student.[4]
- By November 2021, the TB2 drone had completed 400,000 flight-hours globally.[5][2] The largest operator of TB2 drones is the Turkish military, but an export model has been sold to the militaries of a number of other countries.[6][7] Turkey has used the drone extensively in strikes on Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) targets in Iraq and Syria.[8][9][10][11] Bayraktar drones were later deployed by a number of other nations around the world in various wars, such as by Azerbaijan in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine,[12][13] as well as by the Ethiopian National Defense Force during the Tigray War.[14][15][16]
- The development of the Bayraktar TB2 had been spurred by a U.S. ban on exports of armed unmanned aircraft to Turkey due to concerns they would be used against PKK groups inside and outside Turkey.[11]
- Baykar started developing a new combat tactical aerial vehicle system at the request of the Presidency of Defense Industries, after the experiences of its first tactical UAV, the Bayraktar Çaldıran or Bayraktar TB1, delivered to the Turkish army in 2011.[17] The Bayraktar TB2 made its maiden flight in August 2014.[18] On 18 December 2015, a video was published of a test firing of a missile from the Bayraktar TB2, a result of a collaboration with Roketsan. Roketsan's MAM and TUBITAK-SAGE's BOZOK laser-guided bombs were tested for the first time.[19][20][21][22][excessive citations]
- The aircraft previously relied on imported and regulated components and technologies such as Rotax 912 engines[23] (manufactured in Austria) and optoelectronics (FLIR sensors imported from Wescam in Canada or Hensoldt from Germany). Bombardier Recreational Products, owner of Rotax, suspended delivery of their engines to certain countries in October 2020, after becoming aware of their military use despite being certified for civil use only.[23][24]
- According to British newspaper The Guardian, the arming of the Bayraktar TB2 would not have been possible without the help of the UK Hornet micro-munitions bomb rack by EDO MBM Technology Ltd. The bomb rack was provided to Turkey in 2015, and a variant of it was integrated into the aircraft by EDO MBM and Roketsan.[25] In response to The Guardian newspaper article, Baykar Chief Technical Officer Selçuk Bayraktar denied that the bomb rack came from the UK. "We are not buying it from you, we never did. It not only does not work under any circumstances but is also very expensive", Bayraktar said on Twitter. "We have designed and manufactured a more advanced and cost-effective one ourselves."[26]
- On 19 August 2020 the UK Department for International Trade (DIT) disclosed details of a six-year history of exports of the Hornet bomb rack to Turkey between 2014 and 2020, suggesting that supply of the critical technology to Turkey had continued well beyond the development stage of the Bayraktar TB2 and right up to the publication of the Guardian story in November 2019. 18 Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL) applications were submitted by EDO MBM Technology between 2014 and 2020 for exports of goods 'related to Hornet Bomb Racks / Hornet Missile Launchers' for end-users in Turkey. Of these; 16 of the licences were granted.[27]
- In October 2020 the use of the Canadian Wescam MX-15D system in the drone was disclosed after Armenian officials claimed that remains of a MX-15D system had been recovered from a downed TB2 drone during the nation's conflict with Azerbaijan. That triggered the stopping of MX-15D exports to Turkey while an investigation by Global Affairs Canada evaluates the use of Canadian technology in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.[28][29][30] Turkish industry responded to foreign sales boycotts by announcing provision of domestically manufactured alternatives including TEI PD170 engine (manufactured by TEI),[31][32] fuel valves and the CATS FLIR system (manufactured by Aselsan).[33] Integration tests with that system started on 6 November 2020.[34] Turkish defense industry researcher Kadir Doğan tweeted that cancellation of sales of components to Baykar by foreign companies did not pose a major problem, and that as of January 2021, all of those components have been replaced by locally manufactured alternatives.[35]
- However, the majority of Baykar's customers, including Ukraine, Poland, Morocco, and Kuwait, declined to purchase the Aselsan CATS electro-optical turret and opted to order the Wescam MX-15D through an authorized distributor.[36] Reasons include a weight increase from 45 to 61 kg (99 to 134 lb), general performance, and compatibility with existing fleet.[36]
- The Bayraktar TB2 platform has a blended wing body design with an inverted V-tail structure. Thrust is generated by a variable pitch two-blade propeller in pusher configuration. The propeller is mounted between the tail booms and driven by an internal combustion engine located in the body. The monocoque platform is modular with detachable main items such as wing, tail boom, and V-tails. Fuselage pieces are made mostly of carbon fiber composite with machined aluminum parts at joints. Fuel is stored within bladder tanks and fuel consumption is balanced with solenoid valves.
- The ground control station (GCS) is based on a NATO spec shelter unit which is equipped with cross redundant command and control systems. The mobile unit supports three personnel: pilot, payload operator and mission commander. The GCS is equipped with redundant air conditioners and nuclear, biological and chemical filtration (NBC) filtering unit. All hardware inside the shelter is placed inside racked cabinets. Each operator has dual screens in front along with the operator interface software used for real-time command, control and monitoring.[37]
- While the Turkish Armed Forces describes Bayraktar TB2 as "Tactical UAV Class" to prevent it from being a competitor to the TAI Anka UAV, international standards would classify it as a medium-altitude long-endurance UAV.[38][39]
- Each TB2 is configured with six aerial vehicle platforms,[clarification needed] two ground control stations, three ground data terminals (GDT), two remote video terminals (RVT) and ground support equipment.[citation needed] Each aerial platform is equipped with a triply redundant avionics system. Its ground control system's cross redundant architecture allows for pilot, payload operator and mission commander to command, control and monitor the platform.[40]
- The TB2 has a triple-redundant flight control system with autonomous taxi, takeoff, cruise, landing and parking capability. The computerized flight control system is the primary component, conducting sensor fusion algorithms with the real-time sensor data. Mission-specific controls are handled through the mission control computer system. The aerial platform is guided through various redundant rotary and linear servo actuators. All of the main airborne avionics equipment, software and hardware are under constant development.[41]
- The electronic power supply that powers the onboard systems is supported with triple alternators and balanced, smart lithium-ion battery units. A ruggedized heated camera unit is placed in the tail section of the platform to monitor flight and all payload and telemetry data are recorded to the airborne data recorder. The redundancy architecture of the avionics supports autonomous emergency landings on different airfields if necessary. Sensor fusion algorithms, including an inertial navigation system, allow navigation and auto landing even with loss of global positioning signals.[41]
- The price for a single TB2 unit has been estimated at 5 million US dollars, around one-sixth of the US-built Reaper UAV.[42] Baykar has not stated a price, but has republished on its website several news reports about crowdfunding campaigns launched in 2022 in Europe to buy Bayraktar UAVs for Ukraine, all of them fixing a goal of around US$5–5.5 million for the unit.[43][44]
- The Turkish military's use of the TB2 gained prominence in counterinsurgency operations against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) militants positions across the border in Iraq and Syria.[8][9][10][11]
- On 30 June 2018, one Turkish Air Force Bayraktar TB2 crashed due to technical problems in Hatay province, Turkey.[45][46]
- On 15 August 2018, Turkish Land Forces successfully used Bayraktar TB2 in a joint cross-border operation of the Turkish Armed Forces and the National Intelligence Organization of Turkey to kill the senior (PKK) leader and board member of the Kurdistan Communities Union İsmail Özden in Sinjar District, northwestern Iraq.[47]
- Turkish military used combined UAV and artillery tactics in Syria against the PKK-linked YPG. According to Turkey the number of militant killed or wounded rose to 449 by use of armed TB2 and 680 were indirectly in operations assisted by air support from the UAV.[8]
- On 16 May 2021, one Bayraktar TB2 crashed in Zebari, Northern Iraq, Kurdish militants claimed they shot down the drone.[48]
- A total of 37 Turkish Bayraktar TB2 UAVs successfully flew over 1551 hours in the earthquake zone of the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake.The drones have been instrumental in providing continuous updates and data to the crisis response team for damage detection, search and rescue support, along with coordination activities.[49]
- In June 2019, international news media reported that Libya's UN-recognized[50] Government of National Accord (GNA) used Bayraktar TB2s to strike an airbase held by General Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). Despite the UN embargo on Libya's ongoing civil war, it is suspected that at least 3 Bayraktar TB2 UCAV were being used over Tripoli by the GNA government forces. On 6 June 2019, two GNA TB2 drones are destroyed along an operation room by LNA attacks on Mitiga Airport.[51][52] Video evidence showed at least one TB2 flying over Tripoli[53] about to land at Mitiga's Military section, under control of GNA-allied forces.
- In March 2020 Bayraktar TB2s, Anka-S UAVs, and an array of Koral electronic jammers were deployed and extensively used in coordinated action to strike Syrian Army targets on the ground during the Operation Spring Shield launched by Turkey following losses the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the Russian forces in northwestern Syria at the end of February 2020.[82][83][84] The deployment was assessed by experts to be a success and a tactical game-changer.[85][86][87]
- During the week of fighting, Turkish drones took out 73 Syrian armed vehicles.[88] Russian sources said that the Russian-backed Syrian air defences claimed the destruction of seven Bayraktar TB2 UAVs by 5 March 2020.[89] However, there is only visual evidence for three Bayraktar drones being shot down.[90][91][92][93]
- On 23 August 2020, another Bayraktar TB2 drone was shot down by Syrian Air Defenses near Kafr Nabl, Idlib after being detected spotting targets for Syrian rebels.[94][95]
- On 22 October 2021, Turkey launched a surprise attack using Bayraktar TB2s on the Syrian town of Ayn al-Arab, destroying several vehicles and killing a passenger of a car, a suspected member of a Kurdish rebel group.[96]
- In 2022, Turkish drone strikes killed 50 fighters and 10 civilians.[97]
- In June 2020, the Defence Minister of Azerbaijan, Zakir Hasanov, announced that Azerbaijan had decided to purchase Bayraktar drones from Turkey.[98] During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Bayraktar TB2s were used against Armed Forces of Armenia with great success.[99] Azerbaijan used TB2s to destroy Armenian artillery, infantry positions and military vehicles, including BM-30 Smerch MLRS, T-72 tanks, BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFVs.[100][101] Nine Osa and Strela-10 air defense systems were also destroyed by Azerbaijani drones, likely TB2s.[100]
On 19 October 2020, a Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by air defenses of the Armenian Army over Nagorno-Karabakh.[102][103] On 8 November 2020, another Azerbaijani Bayraktar TB2 was shot down by air defense, in southeastern Nagorno-Karabakh.[104]
- As a part of its military modernization program the Armed Forces of Ukraine purchased 12 Bayraktar TB2s in 2019.[105][106] In January 2019, Baykar signed an agreement with Ukrspetsproject, part of Ukroboronprom, on the purchase of six TB2 and 3 ground control stations worth US$69 million for the Ukrainian army.[107][108] Ukraine received the first batch of the UAVs in March 2019.[109] After successful testing of the aircraft, the Ukrainian Navy placed a separate order for six TB2s, to be delivered in 2021, according to navy officials.[110] Meanwhile, Turkish and Ukrainian officials announced the establishment of a joint venture to produce 48 additional Bayraktar TB2s in Ukraine.[111] The first batch of the Bayraktar TB2 complex was delivered to the Navy in July 2021.[112]
- During a Russian military buildup in Crimea and near Ukraine's borders, a TB2 conducted a reconnaissance flight over the Donbas region on 9 April 2021. This was the first operational use of the aircraft by Ukrainian forces within an active conflict zone.[113][114] In October 2021, a TB2 drone was used for the first time in combat during the war, targeting a Russian separatist artillery position, destroying a D-30 howitzer, and halting the bombardment of Ukrainian troops near Hranitne.[115]
- During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, TB2 drones have been used by Ukraine's armed forces against Russian forces and equipment.[116] In January prior to the invasion, the spokesperson for the air force command Lt. Col. Yuri Ihnat confirmed that "Ukraine has approximately 20 Bayraktar drones, but we will not stop there".[117] On 2 March, Ukrainian defense minister Oleksii Reznikov announced the arrival of additional TB2 drones.[118]
- According to video footage released by the armed forces, TB2 drones have successfully destroyed on different occasions a Russian command post, military vehicles including tanks, IFVs, different types of trucks, surface-to-air missile systems (including Buk and Tor), self-propelled artillery, multiple rocket launcher (MLRS), howitzers and an electronic warfare system.[116][119][120][121][122] The drone also reportedly destroyed two Russian fuel trains, patrol boats and helicopter.[123][124][125]
- On 24 February, the day of invasion, four Bayraktar TB2 drones stationed at Chuhuiv Air base were abandoned and later destroyed in the ground by Ukrainian Forces, amid reported Russian rocket attacks.[126] People's Militia of the Luhansk People's Republic claimed it shot down two TB2 drones near the city of Luhansk.[127] On 27 February, Ukraine's air force confirmed two strikes by TB2 on Russian convoys in the Kherson and Zhytomyr regions.[119]
- The chief of Ukraine's air force Lieutenant General Mykola Oleschuk called the UAV system "life-giving".[128] The popularity of the drone in Ukraine led to a song, "Bayraktar" being written about the drone while throwing insults at the Russian army and the invasion.[129][130][131]
- Ukrainian drones appear to be equipped with anti-jamming antenna. They appear to use MAM-C glide bombs and  MAM-L. Traditional search radars appear to struggle against the TB2 because of its slow speed and size, which give it a low radar cross section. One radar that was destroyed on 7 May appeared to be actively scanning just prior to being supposedly hit. Although this may be helped by reports of Russian units turning off their own radars to reduce their own detection. It also can be deployed within minutes and launched from a normal road.[132]
- On 26 February 2022, two TB2 drones were claimed shot down near Schastia.[133] On 17 March 2022, a Bayraktar TB2 was shot down over Kyiv; Russia published images of the drone wreckage.[134] A second TB2 drone was shot down on 29 March 2022, in eastern Ukraine[135][136] On 2 April a third TB-2 drone was shot down.[137][138]
- On 12 April 2022, one Bayraktar TB2 was claimed to be shot down by Russian frigate Admiral Essen off the coast of Crimea.[139][140]
- On 13 April 2022, Ukrainian sources claimed at least two R-360 Neptune missiles were responsible for the sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva – causing an explosion on one of the ship's exposed deckside missile tubes. Drones, likely TB2s, were alleged to have helped decoy the cruiser's defences.[141][142]
- On 26 and 27 April, three additional TB2 drones were destroyed, two in Kursk Oblast[143][144] and the third in Belgorod Oblast, Russia by a Pantsir-S1.[145][146]
- On 1 May, a TB2 drone with registration S51T was shot down in Kursk region, Russia.[147] TB2 losses amounted to seven units confirmed visually.[124]
- On 2 May, Bayraktar drones operated by Ukraine attacked and destroyed two Russian Raptor-class patrol boats near Snake Island.[124]
- On 7 May, a TB2 drone attacked and destroyed a Russian Mil Mi-8 transport helicopter as it was unloading passengers on Snake Island.[125] In the same deployment, a TB2 drone destroyed a Tor missile launcher on the island, while a second launcher was destroyed as it was being unloaded from a landing craft. This cleared the way for a bombing run by Ukrainian Air Force Sukhoi Su-27 'Flanker' aircraft against buildings on the island.[122]
- On 23 May 2022, the remains of a Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2, tail number 75 were found in Romanian territorial waters by Romanian authorities. The drone was likely shot down during the Snake Island attacks made by Ukraine in May 2022.[148][149]
- On 28 May 2022 Lithuanian citizens fundraised $3.2 million, out of the $5.37 million, to buy a single Bayraktar TB2 drone for Ukraine.[150] On 2 June, Baykar said: "The people of Lithuania have honorably raised funds to buy a Bayraktar TB2 for Ukraine. Upon learning this, Baykar will gift a Bayraktar TB2 to Lithuania free of charge and asks those funds go to Ukraine for humanitarian aid."[151]
- From the beginning of the invasion to late June, Ukraine received over 50 TB2s. On 28 June, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced that Baykar would be devoting all of its capacities to meet the needs of the Ukrainian armed forces, fulfilling its requirement for "dozens more" of the aircraft.[152]
- In July 2022 Haluk Bayraktar, CEO of Baykar, stated in an interview that his company would never supply Russia with its drones as he supports Ukraine's sovereignty and independence.[153]
- On 5 May 2023, the Ukrainian air force said it downed one of its own TB2 drone over Kyiv, after they lost control of it due to a "likely" technical malfunction. No casualties were reported from the incident.[154]
- Although at the start of the invasion Ukrainian drones, including the TB2, were able to be used to harass Russian forces, by summer 2022 they had become less effective in this role. The disorganized Russians were initially slow to set up proper air defenses, but once they did Ukrainian UAVs were downed with increasing frequency. In addition to being shot down, electronic warfare is used to jam and disrupt communication links. This may have caused the Ukrainians to scale back TB2 use.[155] On 25 July, a military expert said to the BBC, that the slow speed and medium altitudes of Bayraktar drones made them easy targets for Russian air defenses, and that many were shot down.[156]
- By late July a TB2 with tail number U139 was reported shot down in Belgorod Oblast, Russia.[157] On 2 August another drone with call sign 409 was shot down in Ukraine.[158] On 2 September 2022, the remains of a Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 drone were discovered in Kherson.[159]
- By July 2022, Bayraktar TB2 losses reached 14 units, confirmed visually.[160]
- The commander of the Russian Air Defense Force Lieutenant General Andrey Demin claimed in April 2023 that Russia had shoot down "more than 100" Bayraktar drones since the war began.[161]
- Ethiopian forces have reportedly been using the TB2 against the TPLF in the Tigray War. Satellite images have shown TB2 drones in Harar Meda airbase, and debris of MAM-L guided munition have been found in Tigray.[162][163][164] On 7 January 2022, a drone strike killed nearly 60 civilians and injured dozens more in a camp of internally displaced people in Dedebit in Tigray; the missile used was a MAM-L exclusively used with the TB2 drone.[165]
- Some parts of Africa face attacks by highly mobile bands of Islamist militants, moving through scrubby terrain by motorbike to attack isolated military and civilian targets. This had largely been in the Sahel, but by 2019 had been spreading. Drones provide countries with aerial surveillance capacity to seek and potentially attack insurgents. Buying from Turkey reduces the dependence of Niger and Togo on former colonial power France.[166]
- In October 2020, Baykar CTO Selçuk Bayraktar showed the new, improved version of TB2, named TB2S. In Selçuk Bayraktar's Twitter post, the TB2S has a protrusion on its body and an antenna on its nose for satellite communication (SATCOM).[167][168] In the basic model of TB2, communication between the aircraft and the control station was via ground-based antenna. Communication via the TÜRKSAT satellite provides a much bigger control range than the 150–300 km range of the basic model. The satellite communication will also make the TB2S more resistant to the jamming of communication by the enemy.[169] The SATCOM-integrated TB2S made its maiden flight on 4 December 2020.[170]

- The Bayraktar UAV or Bayraktar UCAV is a family of unmanned aerial vehicles designed and manufactured by Turkish company Baykar.[2] The UAVs were developed for the Turkish Armed Forces from 2004 until the present. Some models are designed for surveillance and reconnaissance only, others are capable of tactical ground-strike missions. Baykar is also developing drones to counter other aerial systems.[3] The word bayraktar means flag-bearer in Turkish.
- Bayraktar Mini UAV is a miniature UAV and the first UAV produced by Turkish company Baykar.[4][5]
- With the concept of short range day and night aerial reconnaissance and surveillance applications, system design activities started in 2004. An initial prototype Bayraktar Mini A was developed in 2005, and following successful autonomous flight demonstrations, Baykar was awarded a contract to start series production by the Turkish Armed Forces. The first batch was composed of 19 aircraft and they were mainly deployed to the southeast parts of Turkey for use in counterterrorism operations.[6]
- After hundreds of hours of flight trials, the system was subjected to major modifications and improved versions were developed. As a result, Bayraktar Mini B was fielded and became operational in December 2007 to be initially operated by the Turkish Armed Forces.[7][8] Due to its success in the region, the system was also exported to the Qatar Armed Forces in 2012.[9][10] The development of the aircraft is being continued and the most recent version (Bayraktar MINI D) has twice the communication range and 3 times higher maximum altitude of its predecessors.[11][12]
- Bayraktar TB1 (or Bayraktar Çaldıran) is the prototype UAV made for the Tactical UAV program of the Undersecretariat for Defence Industries (Savunma Sanayii Mustesarligi or SSM; now the Presidency of Defense Industries) of Turkey,[13] started in 2007. SSM invited two companies to compete for a prototype demonstration phase of the Tactical UAS Program. In 2009, Kale-Baykar, a joint venture between the Kale Group and Baykar Technologies, demonstrated Block A (named Bayraktar Çaldıran)[14] with its dual redundant avionics system and fully autonomous takeoff and landing capability. The aircraft was selected as the winner of the program.[15][16][17] While the contract was signed with the Presidency of Defense Industries for Bayraktar TB1s, these products were not delivered and remained as prototypes for Bayraktar Block 2s. Instead, serial production commenced with Bayraktar TB2.[18]
- Bayraktar TB2 is the serial production aircraft of the first tactical UAV of Baykar, Bayraktar TB1.
- Baykar started to develop a new combat tactical aerial vehicle system on request of Presidency of Defense Industries, after the experiences of its first tactical UAV Bayraktar Çaldıran (TB1) flown in 2011.[19] The Bayraktar TB2 conducted its maiden flight in August 2014. On 18 December 2015, a video was published for the missile test of Bayraktar TB2 in collaboration with ROKETSAN, testing Roketsan's MAM (Smart Micro Munition)s and TUBITAK-SAGE BOZOK laser-guided bombs for the first time.[20][21][22][23][24]
- The Turkish Armed Forces describe Bayraktar as a "Tactical UAV Class" to avoid competition with the TAI Anka UAV, but international standards would classify it as a medium-altitude long-endurance UAV.[25][26]
- Bayraktar Akıncı is the first High-altitude Long Endurance (HALE) class unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) of Baykar.
- The aircraft has a 5.5+ ton maximum takeoff weight (MTOW), with 1350+ kg of this composed of payload. Akıncı is equipped with two turboprop engines which have two different thrust capabilities: 450 or 750 hp. Akinci is equipped with electronic support and countermeasure systems, dual satellite communication systems, air-to-air radar, collision avoidance radar and national advanced synthetic aperture radar.[27]
- The Bayraktar TB3 is a variant of the TB2 that is capable of landing on a ship deck. In February 2021, chairman of the Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB) Ismail Demir made public a new type of UAV being developed by Baykar that is planned to be stationed to Turkey's first amphibious assault ship, TCG Anadolu.[28] The new aircraft being developed is a naval version of the Bayraktar TB2, powered by an engine developed by Turkish company Tusaş Engine Industries (TEI).[29][30] Demir said that between 30 and 50 folding-winged Bayraktar TB3 UAVs will be able to take off from and land on the deck of Anadolu.[31][32] Baykar's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Selçuk Bayraktar said in 2021 that the initial flight of the Bayraktar TB3 was scheduled for 2022.[33]
- Bayraktar Kızılelma (Bayraktar Red Apple) is a proposed supersonic[34] jet-powered single-engined stealth[35] carrier-capable[36] unmanned combat aircraft in development in 2021, planned to fly for the first time in 2023.[37][36]
- According to data shared by the company, Bayraktar Kızılelma will have an operational altitude of 35,000 feet (11,000 metres), a take-off weight of 5.5 tons, a payload of 1.5 tons, and an ammunition carrying capacity of 1 ton.
- Turkish military use TB-2 gained prominence in counterinsurgency operations against Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) positions across the border in Iraq and Syria.[38][39][40] Turkey considers PKK and YPG to be terrorist organizations.[41]
- In June 2019, international news media reported that the Libyan, UN recognized,[42] Government of National Accord (GNA) used Bayraktar TB2s to strike an airbase held by General Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). Despite the UN embargo on Libya's ongoing civil war, it is suspected that at least three Bayraktar TB2 UCAV were being used over Tripoli by the GNA government forces. On 6 June 2019, two GNA Bayraktar TB2 drones were destroyed along with an operation room by LNA attacks on Mitiga Airport.[43][44] Video evidence shows at least one Bayraktar TB2 flying over Tripoli[45] about to land at Mitiga's Military section, under control of GNA-allied forces.
- In March 2020 Bayraktar TB2s, Anka-S UAVs and an array of Koral electronic jammers were deployed and extensively used in coordinated action to strike Syrian Army targets on the ground during the Operation Spring Shield launched by Turkey following losses the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the Russian forces in northwestern Syria at the end February 2020.[46][47][48] The deployment was assessed by experts to be a success and a tactical game changer.[49][50][51]
- In June 2020 the Defence Minister of Azerbaijan, Zakir Hasanov, announced that Azerbaijan had decided to purchase Bayraktar drones from Turkey.[52] During the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war, Bayraktar TB2s were used against Armed Forces of Armenia with great success.[53] Azerbaijan used TB-2s to destroy Armenian artillery, infantry positions and military vehicles including BM-30 Smerch MLRS, T-72s tanks, BMP-1 and BMP-2 IFVs.[54][55] Several Osa, Strela-10 and 5 S-300 air defense systems were also destroyed by TB2s.[54][56][57][58]
- As a part of its military modernization program, the Armed Forces of Ukraine acquired 12 Bayraktar TB2s in 2019.[59][60] After successful use of the aircraft, the Ukrainian Navy ordered 5 additional Bayraktar TB2s, reportedly delivered in 2020.[61] Meanwhile, Turkish and Ukrainian officials announced the establishment of a joint venture to produce 48 additional Bayraktar TB2s in Ukraine.[62]
- Ukraine's Bayraktar TB2s were used extensively during the 2022 Russian invasion[63] for surveillance of and attacks on Russian ground convoys.[64][65] The drones played a significant role in deterring Russian advances in the early stages of the conflict.[66]
- Ukrainian Chief of General Staff Valery Zaluzhny made available Bayraktar TB2 operation photographs on his Facebook account, including destruction of a Russian-made Buk Air Defense Missile System.[67]
- It has been reported that Baykar has exported its drones to at least 30 countries.[68] Only 16 of these user countries are publicly known, while the others countries are unknown:[69][70]

- For months rumors have been circulating that Turkish Bayraktar TB-2 armed drones are being deployed by the Ethiopian government in their fight against the Tigray Defence Forces, an armed resistance group that took up weapons in 2020.  In December 2021, the New York Times quoted anonymous Western diplomats who raised concerns over Turkish drone sales and subsequent use. However, verifiable visual identification of Turkish drones in Ethiopia was still lacking.
- Now new Planet Skysat high-resolution imagery confirms the presence of the TB-2 at the Harar Meda military airport at Bishoftu, just south of Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa. This makes it the third type of armed drone that has been spotted in the ongoing conflict, after the Iranian Mohajer-6 and the Chinese Wing Loong drones, as demonstrated by earlier Bellingcat and PAX investigations. The growing deployment of armed drones is also linked with an increase of allegations that these drones were used in attacks that killed dozens of civilians, wounding many more, with remnants of drone missiles found at strike locations.
- The new satellite image, dated 9 December 2021, shows the drone at a hangar at the center of the airbase. Both the wingspan (12m) and length (6.5m) match that of the TB-2.
- Below the drone, there are three  green container-like structures placed, with two of those having the same measurement. Using known information of the size of the TB-2 Ground Control Station, namely 2.2 x 5.9m, we see a match of those containers with the size of a TB2 GCS.  It should be noted that these sizes are fairly standard for shipping containers, making it difficult to clearly identify them as the TB-2 GCS, but the similarities and location make it very likely. There was initially one such container, but from 22 November 2021, two more were placed there, which could indicate an extension of the amount of TB-2 drones at this airbase.
- And lastly, a source from Ethiopia that wished to remain anonymous, shared a video with PAX that was allegedly filmed in Karakore, a town in north east Ethiopia on November 11. Though we can not verify the location nor the date, the video does indeed seem to show a  TB-2 drone.  Using video enhancement, with credit to Timmi Allen from Bellingcat, the outline corresponds with that of a TB-2 as seen in the video below, with the characteristic double tail-wing and rounded fuselage around the wings.
- To be certain it is indeed a TB-2, and not a similar looking drone, for example a Iranian Mohajer-6, experts consulted f made ratio comparison of known measurements of the wingspan and lengths of the  TB-2 compared with the pixel size of the image, this indeed corresponds with a TB-2.
- Enhanced video screenshot from the footage
- A drone operating from the shadows
- Since the summer of 2021, there have been indications that the TB-2 drone was used, yet these were not conclusive. A photo of fragments of a MAM-L air-to-surface missile, known to be used by TB-2 drones, was shared by Tigrayans with a journalist in October 2021. However, it couldn’t be independently verified where the photo was taken. The next hint was a video shared with Twitter user @Gerjon_, who scans air traffic going in and out of Ethiopia. The video was allegedly shot near Harar Meda airbase. Image analysis and comparison indeed show a convincing match with a TB-2.
- Nevertheless, while the similarities were clear, this source also could not be verified, nor were there any recognizable features visible in the video that could be helpful for geolocation, making it difficult to say for certain this was in Ethiopia.
- The second clue came in early December from a Planet Skysat image posted by the geospatial analyst Chris Biggers, who spotted an object in October with a possible similar measurement of a TB-2 at Harar Meda airport. However, the satellite image quality wasn’t high enough to be conclusive.
- The current confirmed presence based on new satellite imagery of the TB-2 at Harar Meda makes this airbase Ethiopia’s main drone hub. Satellite imagery now shows the presence of Chinese Wing Loong armed drones, and recently satellite imagery published by PAX also showed the Iranian Mohajer-6 drones located at this airfield. These drones were previously spotted at the Semera airbase in the east of the country.
- Armed drones and arms export control
- The rapid advancement of Tigray forces towards Ethiopia’s capital surprised observers, in particular as Ethiopia has a capable air force with fighter jets and attack helicopters. Yet these were often limited due to a lack of sufficient precision munitions. The arrival of Iranian, Chinese and now Turkish armed drones seems to have turned the tide in favor of the Ethiopian government, putting the Tigrayans on the defensive and forcing them to the negotiating table. The use of armed drones in this conflict seems like a double-edged sword: airstrikes with Mig-23 and Sukhoi Su-27 jet fighters and attack helicopters using unguided missiles and bombs increased the risk of killing civilians, and there are mounting reports on civilian casualties from airstrikes, whereas drones with guided missiles could avert civilian casualties. However, there are strong indications based on eye-witness accounts and munition remnants found in the field that armed drones also have been involved in attacks against civilians or civilian objects.
- The numerous human rights violations, some amounting to war crimes, conducted by both the Ethiopian government and the Tigrayan forces, is sufficient reason to halt all arms sales to the country.  In 2013, Turkey signed the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), an international treaty that regulates the trade in conventional weapons, including armed drones. Though Turkey did not ratify the ATT yet, it stated in September 2021 to work towards completing this process.   Article 23 of the ATT stipulated that “Any State may at the time of signature or the deposit of instrument of its of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, declare that it will apply provisionally Article 6 and Article 7 pending the entry into force of this Treaty for that State.” , hence it can be expected of Turkey to adhere to assess its arms export in case it could lead to violation of international humantarian or human rights law.  The current approval of sales of TB-2 drones to Ethiopia is out of touch with the human rights situation on ground, which should be sufficient grounds for denial of an export license.
- With new arms export contracts for Turkish drones concluded all over Africa, it is expected that the growing deployment of armed drones will soon see an increase in use as well. Already armed drones, either Chinese or Israeli, have been implicated in various strikes by Morocco against separatist groups in 2021 and the country now also operates TB-2 drones. In its 2021 Remote Horizons report, PAX documented the rapid advance of military drones across Africa. Their growing popularity and increased deployment in opaque military operations on the African continent comes accompanied with a general failure to address international calls for transparency and accountability of armed drone strikes, both by African and third states,  in particular in counter-terrorism operations. The current developments should warrant for rapid international action to strengthen international legal principles over the use of lethal force and rethink arms export controls and risk assessments around the sale of armed drones.

- Turkey’s drone exports are giving the country greater geopolitical sway but Ankara is coming under pressure over their use in Ethiopia’s war.
- Press play to listen to this article
- Voiced by artificial intelligence.
- NAIROBI — Newly obtained photographs of missile fragments provide the first material evidence that Ethiopia used a Turkish drone this month in an attack that killed 58 civilians sheltering in a school.
- Turkey’s growing prowess as a drone exporter is styled as a point of national pride by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but any indication that a Turkish aircraft targeted civilians in Ethiopia’s 15-month-long war will intensify international pressure on the NATO country to stop arming Addis Ababa.
- Drones are rapidly turning into the decisive weapon of the conflict and have helped Ethiopian government forces turn the tide against rebels from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, which governed the country for nearly three decades before 2018. Military experts say Ethiopia is buying unmanned aerial vehicles not only from Turkey, but also from Iran, the United Arab Emirates and China.
- Aid workers in the northern Tigray region provided POLITICO with photographs that show exploded shards of a laser-guided bomb used in a strike on the town of Dedebit late on the night of January 7. The attack hit a school holding internally displaced people, including children, according to aid workers and Tigrayan leaders.
- Studying those photographs, military experts from the Dutch nongovernmental organization PAX and Amnesty International identified the weapon used as a MAM-L bomb that is fitted to a Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drone. The photographs were taken on January 13 after the aid workers extracted the missile fragments from the debris. The Bayraktar drones are made by a company in which Erdoğan’s son-in-law is a senior executive.
- Turkish diplomats posted to Ethiopia did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Questions on the use of the MAM-L munition put to Turkish government spokespeople in Ankara also went unanswered. Billene Seyoum, a spokeswoman for Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, and Ethiopia’s military spokesman Colonel Getnet Adane did not reply to requests for comment sent by email and text message.
- Ethiopia’s use of drones in its war with the Tigray region has killed more than 300 civilians, according to data compiled by aid workers in the Tigray region who requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information. The U.N. reported a series of drone strikes as recently as January 15 in the Tigrayan towns of Maychew, Korem and Samre, reportedly killing 12 more civilians and injuring several others.
- Unlike the Ethiopian government forces, the Tigrayan fighters do not have drones.
- The attacks have drawn criticism from U.S. President Joe Biden and a warning from the United Nations that they may constitute a grave violation of international law.
- Turkey’s role is gaining increased global attention. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said its former special envoy to the Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Feltman, raised reports of armed drone use in Ethiopia and the “attendant risk of civilian harm” during visits to the United Arab Emirates and Turkey in December.
- “He underscored that the U.S. is making clear to all external parties engaged on all sides of the conflict that now is the time for all outside actors to press for negotiation and end the war,” the spokesperson said.
- Wim Zwijnenburg, project leader of humanitarian disarmament at PAX, which identified the MAM-L weapon, said Turkey could not wash its hands of the matter.
- “There is a very strong case to make that these drones should never have been exported at all,” he said, noting that Turkey is a signatory to the U.N.’s arms trade treaty, which stipulates a risk assessment should be done on the potential of human harm before a sale is carried out. (While Turkey signed the pact in 2013, it has not ratified it.)
- Zwijnenburg also stressed the need for information on the potential involvement of Turkish personnel in the deployment of the weapons.
- “Because this is technology that requires a lot of maintenance and piloting, Turkey could be made directly responsible if there is a consistent pattern of drone strikes used against civilians and Turkish crew is on the ground doing maintenance on the drones,” he said.
- Spokespeople for the Turkish presidency and foreign ministry did not respond to questions from POLITICO on whether Turkish citizens were involved in piloting the drones or whether they were helping train people to use drones.
- While Ankara had no comment on the use of Turkish drones, Zwijnenburg said that satellite imagery his organization had acquired identified a TB2 drone in Bahir Dar in the region bordering Tigray on December 16 last year. The identification was possible thanks to the unique dimensions of the wingspan and length of the aircraft. That location would enable the unmanned aircraft to reach several targets in Tigray, including Dedebit.
- Brian Castner, a weapons adviser for Amnesty International’s Crisis Team, agreed a Turkish drone and missile had been used. “The wing bolts are distinctive on many of these drone-launched munitions, and this is definitely a MAM-L,” he said.
- Questions regarding the attack in Dedebit sent to Baykar, the maker of the TB2 drone, and Roketsan, the Turkish manufacturer of the MAM-L missile identified in the images, went unanswered.
- Drone exports have become a mainstay of Turkey’s foreign policy strategy. In 2020, during a 44-day war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, Azerbaijan gained the upper hand thanks to drones supplied by Turkey and Israel.
- Military analysts saw the conflict as an example of Turkey flexing its geopolitical muscle at Russia. Indeed, President Vladimir Putin last month criticized Turkey’s decision to arm Ukraine with attack drones, according to a Kremlin statement.
- In August, Abiy and Erdoğan signed cooperation deals in the water, financial and military sectors.
- The drones are manufactured by the company Baykar where Selçuk Bayraktar, the son-in-law of President Erdoğan, works as chief technology officer. Africa has become a key export market for Baykar following sales to Morocco and Tunisia in September last year. Baykar did not respond to a list of questions about the strike in Ethiopia.
- Somalia, where Ankara already has a military base, Nigeria and Angola have also expressed an interest in doing a deal for the drones, according to two European diplomats speaking on the condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak publicly.
- “Everywhere I go in Africa, everyone asks about UAVs,” Erdoğan said in remarks carried by the Anadolu news agency after a visit to Angola, Nigeria and Togo in October, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles.
- More broadly, Turkey has repeatedly expressed concerns regarding the conflict in Ethiopia, with Ankara officially calling for “an immediate ceasefire for the urgent cessation of the violence” and reiterating support for establishing dialogue between all parties in a press release issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry on November 5.
- Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu echoed Turkey’s willingness to provide support and encouraged talks in a conversation with his Ethiopian counterpart Demeke Mekonnen later in the month, according to reports made to the state-run Anadolu Agency.
- “Turkey will continue to support efforts towards preserving peace, serenity and stability in Ethiopia,” the country said the statement on November 5.

- Dozens of people have been killed in airstrikes in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray in recent months.
- Some of the attacks have involved the use of armed drones, and there's growing concern about the number of civilian casualties.
- The government, which has been fighting rebels for over a year, says it has the right to use whatever arms it sees fit.
- It denies that it has targeted civilians.
- An air attack on a camp for internally displaced people in Dedebit in Tigray on 8 January, killed more than 50 people and left more than a hundred injured.
- Images of the aftermath  - supplied to Politico by aid workers - have led open-source investigators to believe one weapon used in this incident could have been a missile fired from a Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drone.
- Fragments - including wing pieces - appear to match those of a type fitted to these drones, according to researchers from the Netherlands-based Pax peace group and Amnesty International.
- The presence of Turkish drones in Ethiopia was revealed in December by Wim Zwijnenburg, an investigator who works with Pax.
- He highlighted satellite imagery showing Turkish drones parked at a government air base south of the Tigray region.
- They can be identified by comparing the dimensions, including the wingspan and length, from satellite images.

- We don't know if these particular drones were used in this incident, and the Ethiopian government has not confirmed their use.
- Turkey signed a defence co-operation agreement with Ethiopia last year, although the details were not made public.
- Reuters reported in December that the US had voiced its concern to the Turkish government over drone sales to Ethiopia.
- An attack in early January was carried out on rebels in the Oromia region, who have made common cause with rebels in Tigray.
- Few details have emerged, and it is not clear if there were casualties.
- However, the air strike in the Gidami area did leave some evidence - missile fragments - which according to one investigation, suggested the use of Iranian munitions.
- Satellite imagery from last December revealed the presence of an Iranian drone at Harar Meda airport, identified by its dimensions and other features.
- A flight-tracking investigator has identified about 15 cargo flights from Iran to Harar Meda and Bole airports in August 2021. What they were carrying is not known.
- However, last October, the US authorities publicly condemned Iran for its drone exports and named Ethiopia as one of the recipients of Iranian drone technology.
- In mid-December 2021, a series of air attacks led to the deaths of 28 civilians in a market place in Alamata in southern Tigray.
- The main Tigray rebel group, the TPLF, alleged that government jets and drones were responsible.
- Video footage was aired on a Tigrayan TV station, showing the remains of a missile said to have been used in this incident.
- The missile motor tailpipe, which tends to survive impact, can be identified from the footage.
- One open-source investigation - using publicly available information to try to establish exactly what happened - concluded that, based on these images, the fragments looked identical to a Chinese-made Blue Arrow 7 missile that can be mounted on a drone.
- Satellite imagery revealed that Chinese-manufactured Wing Loong drones were parked at Ethiopia's Harar Meda military airbase on 15 December  - the day before the Alamata attack.
- Open-source investigators believe China was the original source for Ethiopia's Wing Loong drones, initially intended for surveillance use.
- Data from flight-tracking apps shows cargo shipments from Chengdu in China, home of state-owned drone manufacturer Chengdu Aircraft Industry, to Ethiopia in September and October last year.
- But there's another country with both Wing Loong drones and Blue Arrow missiles which has also sent supplies to Ethiopia - the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
- Going by an arms database maintained by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the UAE has both Wing Loong drones, and Blue Arrow missiles.
- And flight data research shows 119 cargo flights over a period of five months last year from UAE military airports to the Harar Meda air base (south-east of Addis Ababa) and Bole, the main international airport in the capital. Again, we can't be sure what these flights carried.
- Ethiopian government spokesperson Legesse Tulu would not go into details about the above incidents.
- He told the BBC: "I will not say where, but the government has used them [drones] in different times and places." He also insisted they were not used against civilians.
- We don't know for certain when these drones were supplied.
- The BBC contacted the governments concerned about reports that armed drones from their countries have been used in Ethiopia - but they have not responded.
- We also approached the Turkish defence company which makes the Bayraktar drone, but did not get a response.
- There is no arms embargo on Ethiopia currently, and the export of armed drones is a grey area in terms of international regulation and treaties.
- But their use in conflict zones around the world appears to be on the rise.
- Wim Zwijnenburg, from the Pax group, believes the example of Ethiopia "raises serious questions, considering the many allegations of violations of international law".

- An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the Turkish government did not respond to queries. A government spokesman declined to comment. Also, the munition manufacturer, not the drone manufacturer, did not respond to requests for comment. Those items were corrected Feb. 7. Based on information that emerged after publication, the article was further corrected Feb. 17 to reflect that multiple munitions, rather than a single bomb, were dropped by drone on the school and the surrounding area.
- Shortly after midnight one month ago, hundreds of hungry people made homeless by the war in Ethiopia — mostly women, children and elderly men — slept on a cramped floor in an empty school with a tin roof.
- With a flash in the dark, the building and the grounds around it were struck by drone-delivered bombs, killing at least 59 people and gravely injuring dozens more, according to an aid worker whose organization worked at the camp for internally displaced people in Dedebit and analyses of satellite images of the impact sites. He and other aid workers at the camp, located in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray, were adamant: The people killed and wounded were civilians fleeing the war, not combatants in it.
- The Washington Post analyzed photos of shrapnel and satellite imagery and cross-referenced video of the aftermath to confirm that Turkish-made precision-guided munitions were used in the strike, which took place in the early hours of Jan. 7. The Ethiopian military is the only party in the conflict known to have access to armed drones.
- The emergence of armed drones in Ethiopia reflects a proliferation of unmanned aircraft that has transformed conflicts around the world, from Libya to Ukraine, as weapons that were once the province of superpowers become widely available and employed to deadly purpose by governments and rebel groups. In Ethiopia, the government’s use of armed drones has turned the 16-month conflict against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in its favor.
- The use of a precision-guided weapon in the strike in Dedebit raises questions about the Ethiopian government’s targets, which internal documents at aid organizations say have hit not just this camp, but also other locations far from the battlefield, including a flour mill, a public bus, farms, hotels and busy markets.
- Those documents, which were shared with The Washington Post, say more than 300 civilians have been killed by drone and airstrikes since last September, including more than 100 since the start of this year. Those deaths represent a fraction of the thousands who are estimated to have died in the conflict and more than 4 million others, in Tigray and neighboring regions, who face a humanitarian crisis.
- The Ethiopian government has not acknowledged the strike and did not respond to multiple requests for comment on how the target was chosen. A Turkish government spokesman declined to comment. The Turkish manufacturer of the drone’s munition did not respond to The Post’s queries about the use of their product in the conflict. An ongoing communications blackout and government restrictions on access have made assessing ground realities in Tigray exceptionally challenging.
- Local aid workers and Tigrai Television, a local media outlet linked to the TPLF, filmed the aftermath of the strike. The Post verified the videos by locating the structures in the footage in satellite imagery of the camp and by comparing the clips to each other.
- In the videos, bodies are lined up in rows near the targeted school, surrounded by a grieving crowd. Entire limbs are torn off, faces disfigured beyond recognition. At least five women and seven children are visible among the dead. A priest sprinkles holy water, and a man gently covers up a child’s body with cloth.
- One woman collapses to the ground. “Why did you leave me behind?” she asks. “Whom did you leave me with?”
- “The world has forsaken us,” another onlooker cries. “The world has betrayed us.”
- Weapon remnants recovered from the site of the strike by aid workers showed internal components and screw configurations that matched images of Turkish-made MAM-L munitions released by the weapons manufacturer. The MAM-L pairs exclusively with the Turkish-made TB-2 drone.
- “On a lot of these new drone-dropped weapons, the bodies and internal electronics can appear similar, but each manufacturer uses different screw configurations to attach the wings to the fuselage of the munition,” said Brian Castner, a weapons investigator for Amnesty International. The MAM-Ls have a four-screw pattern, he said.
- Other images of shrapnel, which reveal different components of the laser-guided munition’s wings, corroborated this analysis.
- The nearly 50-pound weapon used in Dedebit can travel roughly nine miles from the time it is released until its impact. It is meant for targets such as tanks, light armored vehicles or personnel, according to the manufacturer’s website.
- A comparison of high-resolution satellite imagery taken before and after the strike reveals a four-by-three meter hole in the roof of the primary school.
- “The damage to the red roof and interior of the building looks consistent with a weapon of this size,” Castner told The Post. He cautioned that this did not necessarily mean the primary school had indeed been the intended target.
- For much of the conflict, definitive open-source evidence showed the Ethiopian government had a small number of Chinese commercial drones that had been used by the country’s police, and a cadre of unarmed Israeli-made drones.
- By late 2021, Ethiopia had dramatically expanded its fleet of drones. Turkey sold drones to Ethiopia as recently as October, Reuters reported, citing officials with knowledge of the agreement, well into a war marked by rounds of atrocities against civilians.
- Open-source researchers confirmed the presence of Chinese-made Wing Loong drones in Ethiopia in November and Iranian-made drones in Ethiopia in August. Flight data from aircraft originating in the United Arab Emirates has led to speculation that the UAE — which has been a staunch government ally — provided Chinese-made Wing Loong drones and may have also provided modified, commercially made armed drones to the government.
- Satellite imagery from November first revealed a Turkish-made TB-2 drone stationed at Harar Meda, a key Ethiopian military air base outside of Addis Ababa, according to Wim Zwijnenburg, a project leader for humanitarian disarmament at the Netherlands-based organization Pax, which focuses on protecting civilians from acts of war and ending violence globally.
- Zwijnenburg used satellite imagery, news reports and open-source reports to track weapons remnants and collaborated with plane spotters who monitor the flow of military cargo to track the Ethiopian military’s buildup of foreign-made drones in recent months.
- 
- Open-source investigators recorded Turkish-, Chinese-, and Iranian-built drones at four Ethiopian air bases as early as August 2021.
- Of those, only Bahir Dar, which serves as both a civilian and military airport, would have been within the 300-kilometer (roughly 186-mile) range where the Turkish TB-2 could deliver the munition and return to base.
- A drone that matches the measurements and description of the Turkish TB-2 was spotted on the tarmac of Bahir Dar Airport, according to Zwijnenburg and The Post’s examination of available satellite imagery the day before the strike and again on Jan. 26.
- “The military drones made a significant difference to the Ethiopian air force and their ability to push back the advances from the Tigray Defense Forces,” Zwijnenburg told The Post. “This is likely going to stay for a while.”
- Remnants of the MAM-L munitions at other recent strikes in the Tigray region and elsewhere suggest the TB-2 continues to be used widely.
- Relations between Ethiopia and Western governments have soured during the conflict, in part due to concerns over atrocities committed by government and government-aligned troops, as well as Ethiopia’s purchase of armed drones from not just Turkey but also Iran and China.
- Reports over the past two months suggest U.S. officials are increasingly anxious about the role Turkish-made drones continue to play in the ongoing war. In September, the White House announced sanctions for people involved with the humanitarian and human rights crisis in Ethiopia. There has been no evidence that the administration has made this kind of move against Turkish companies or citizens.
- “The United States has profound humanitarian concerns regarding the consequences of any military sales to Ethiopia,” a State Department spokesman, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of agency protocol, told The Post. “We have raised reports of drone use in Ethiopia with both the UAE and Turkey, and have made clear to all external parties engaged on all sides of the conflict that now is the time for all outside actors to press for negotiations and end the war.”
- Casualties from drone strikes make up just a sliver of war-related civilian deaths, aid workers said. A blockade that has stayed mostly in place since last summer’s TPLF offensive means that very little humanitarian aid — food, medicine or fuel — enters Tigray.
- Both the Ethiopian government and its allies as well as the TPLF have accused each other of looting and destroying food stores and hospitals as battle lines have shifted over the course of the conflict. The World Health Organization conducted a survey that found only 3 percent of clinics in Tigray remained functional.
- “It’s actually a wave of death. Far more in Tigray have died of birth complications, heart attacks, diabetes, effects of malnutrition, lack of medicines, or no fuel to move people toward care,” said Ilham Abdelhai, a senior World Health Organization emergency official with experience in Tigray. “Yes, the drone strike was horrific, but even before that, there is a daily reality of destitution and lack of basic health care. The supplies we may be able to bring in now are just a drop in the ocean.”

- ISTANBUL/ADDIS ABABA, Dec 22 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities have taken issue with Turkey over its sales of armed drones to Ethiopia, where two sources familiar with the matter said there was mounting evidence the government had used the weapons against rebel fighters.
- Washington has "profound humanitarian concerns" over the sales, which could contravene U.S. restrictions on arms to Addis Ababa, a senior Western official said.
- The year-long war between Ethiopia's government and the leadership of the northern Tigray region, among Africa's bloodiest conflicts, has killed thousands of civilians and displaced millions.
- A State Department spokesman said U.S. Horn of Africa envoy Jeffrey Feltman "raised reports of armed drone use in Ethiopia and the attendant risk of civilian harm" during a visit to Turkey last week.
- A senior Turkish official said Washington conveyed its discomfort at a few meetings, while Ethiopia's military and government did not respond to detailed requests for comment.
- Turkey, which is selling drones to several countries in Europe, Africa and Asia, has dismissed criticism that it plays a destabilising role in Africa and has said it is in touch with all sides in Ethiopia to urge negotiations.
- Last week the United Nations agreed to set up an independent investigation into rights abuses in Ethiopia, a move strongly opposed by its government.  read more
- Tigrayan rebel forces said on Monday they were withdrawing from some northern regions after government advances and, in a letter to the UN, called for a no-fly zone for drones and other hostile aircraft over Tigray.  read more
- The U.S. State Department clamped down in May on exports of defence products for Ethiopia's armed forces.
- In September, the White House authorised sanctions on those engaged, even indirectly, in policies that threaten stability, expand the crisis or disrupt humanitarian assistance there, though there has been no indication of any such imminent action against Turkey.
- The U.S. Treasury, which has broad economic sanctions authority under that executive order, declined to comment on whether sanctions could apply to Turkey.
- The senior Turkish official said the foreign ministry examined how the drone sales might impact U.S. foreign policy as part of 2022 budget planning.
- "The United States has conveyed its discomfort with Turkey's drone sales ...but Turkey will continue to follow the policies it set in this area," the person told Reuters.
- A second senior Turkish official, from the defence ministry, said Ankara had no intention of meddling in any country's domestic affairs.
- Turkish defence exports to Ethiopia surged to almost $95 million in the first 11 months of 2021, from virtually nothing last year, according to Exporters' Assembly data.
- Ethiopian government soldiers interviewed by Reuters near Gashena, a hillside town close to the war's front, said a recent government offensive succeeded following an influx of reinforcements and the use of drones and airstrikes to target Tigrayan positions.  read more
- A Reuters team spotted destroyed tanks and armoured anti-aircraft trucks there.  read more
- A foreign military official based in Ethiopia said satellite imagery and other evidence gave "clear indications" that drones were being used, and estimated up to 20 were operating. It was unclear how many might be Turkish-made.
- "Surveillance drones are having a greater impact ...and being very helpful," the person said, adding the guerrilla-warfare nature of the conflict made armed drones less useful.
- Asked whether foreign countries had also supplied drone operators, the official said: "I know Turkish personnel were here at one point."
- Turkish and Ethiopian officials have not publicly confirmed the drones sale, which Reuters first reported in October, and Turkey's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for further details.  read more
- It said last week that U.S. envoy Feltman and Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Onal had discussed developments in Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan.
- Ethiopia has also bought drones from the United Arab Emirates, which did not respond to a request for comment about possible U.S. concerns. Feltman was also scheduled to visit the UAE earlier this month.
- Under President Tayyip Erdogan, Ankara has poured military equipment into Africa and the Middle East, including training of armed forces in Somalia, where it has a base.
- The Turkish military used its Bayraktar TB2 drones last year with success in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, prompting interest from buyers globally in a market led by U.S., Chinese and Israeli manufacturers.  read more
- In October, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said Ethiopia was free to procure drones from anywhere. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week that engagement with Africa was based on mutual benefit.
- NATO allies Washington and Ankara have strained ties over several issues including the Turkish purchase of Russian missile defences, and U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in northern Syria.
- The State Department spokesperson said Feltman had underscored that "now is the time for all outside actors to press for negotiations and end the war" in Ethiopia.
- The Western official, who requested anonymity, said Ankara had responded to U.S. concerns by saying it attaches humanitarian provisions to the Ethiopia deal and requires signed undertakings outlining how drones will be used.

URL: https://stockholmcf.org/turkish-drone-used-by-ethiopia-killed-59-civilians-sheltering-in-a-school-in-tigray-report/
- The Washington Post has analyzed photos of shrapnel and satellite imagery and cross-referenced video to confirm that Ethiopia used a Turkish drone in January in an attack that killed at least 59 civilians sheltering in a school in Tigray, according to an analysis by the paper published on Monday.
- On January 7, a school was struck by a drone-delivered bomb, killing at least 59 people and gravely injuring dozens more, according to aid workers whose organizations worked at the camp for internally displaced people in Dedebit, located in the northern Ethiopian region of Tigray.
- According to The Washington Post, more than 300 civilians have been killed by drone and air strikes since September, including more than 100 since the start of this year.
- Weapon remnants recovered from the site of the strike by aid workers showed internal components and screw configurations that matched images of Turkish-made MAM-L munitions released by the weapons manufacturer. The MAM-L pairs exclusively with the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB-2 drone.
- Military experts from the Dutch nongovernmental organization PAX and Amnesty International also identifiedthe weapon used as a MAM-L bomb that is fitted to a TB2 drone, Politico earlier reported.
- The attacks have drawn criticism from US President Joe Biden and a warning from the United Nations that they may constitute a grave violation of international law, Politico said.
- Drones are rapidly turning into the decisive weapon of the conflict and have helped Ethiopian government forces turn the tide against rebels from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, which governed the country for nearly three decades before 2018.
- Turkey has exported Bayraktar armed drones manufactured by defense contractor Baykar Makina Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Şirketi (Baykar), which is run by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s son-in-law Selçuk Bayraktar. Ukraine, Poland, Qatar, Libya, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia and Azerbaijan have all taken delivery of the armed drones.
- According to Turkey’s 2021 export figures announced by the Turkish Exporters Assembly in early December, Turkey’s arms sales reached a record level, with the biggest increase to African countries.
- In the first 11 months of 2021, Turkey exported $2.793 billion worth of defense products, an increase of 39.7 percent compared to the same period of the previous year. The Turkish defense industry, which set an export record of $2.7 billion in 2019, is preparing to set a new record by closing this year with exports of more than $3 billion. For the first time the defense sector had a 1.8 percent share of Turkey’s total exports in November 2021.

URL: https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/aid-workers-say-ethiopia-air-strike-northwest-tigray-killed-56-people-2022-01-08/
- ADDIS ABABA, Jan 8 (Reuters) - An air strike in Ethiopia's Tigray region killed 56 people and injured 30, including children, in a camp for displaced people, two aid workers told Reuters on Saturday, citing local authorities and eyewitness accounts.
- Military spokesman Colonel Getnet Adane and government spokesman Legesse Tulu did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's spokeswoman Billene Seyoum did not respond to a request for comment.
- The government has previously denied targeting civilians in the 14-month conflict with rebellious Tigrayan forces.
- The spokesman for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) that has been fighting the central government, Getachew Reda, said in a tweet that "Another callous drone attack by Abiy Ahmed in an IDP (Internally Displaced People) camp in Dedebit has claimed the lives of 56 innocent civilians so far."
- The strike in the town of Dedebit, in the northwest of the region near the border with Eritrea, occurred late on Friday night, said the aid workers, who asked not to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
- Earlier on Friday, the government had freed several opposition leaders from prison and said it would begin dialogue with political opponents in order to foster reconciliation.  read more
- Both aid workers said the number of dead was confirmed by the local authorities. The aid workers sent Reuters pictures they said they had taken of the wounded in hospital, who included many children.
- One of the aid workers, who visited Shire Suhul General Hospital where the injured were brought for treatment, said the camp hosts many old women and children.
- "They told me the bombs came at midnight. It was completely dark and they couldn't escape," the aid worker said.
- Ethiopian federal troops went to war with rebellious Tigrayan forces in November 2020. Since the war erupted, Reuters has reported atrocities by all sides, which the parties to the fighting have denied.
- One of the aid workers said that one of the wounded in Friday's strike, Asefa Gebrehaworia, 75, burst into tears as he recounted how his friend was killed. He was being treated for injuries to his left leg and hand.

- Fighting had forced Asefa out of his home and now the air strike had destroyed the camp, where even though he was facing hunger at least he had shelter, he told the aid worker. He had arrived in the camp for displaced people from the border town of Humera.
- Before the latest strike, at least 146 people have been killed and 213 injured in air strikes in Tigray since Oct. 18, according to a document prepared by aid agencies and shared with Reuters this week.
- In Friday's reconciliation move, the government freed opposition leaders from several ethnic groups. They included some leaders of the TPLF.
- The U.S. government said Abiy had outlined the steps he is taking towards national reconciliation to its outgoing special envoy for the region, Jeffrey Feltman, when he visited Ethiopia this week.
- "We welcome the release of prisoners as a positive move in that context," said a spokesperson for the State Department.
- The European Union said that while the release of opposition leaders was a positive move, it was concerned by the ongoing conflict in Tigray, citing the latest air strike.
- "All parties must seize the moment to swiftly end the conflict and enter into dialogue," the bloc said in a statement issued by its high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell.
- The TPLF expressed scepticism about Abiy's call for national reconciliation.
- "His daily routine of denying medication to helpless children and of sending drones targeting civilians flies in the face of his self-righteous claims," its spokesman Getachew tweeted on Friday.
- The TPLF accuses federal authorities of imposing an aid blockade on the region, leading to hunger and shortages of essentials like fuel and medicines. The government denies blocking the passage of aid convoys.
