- Sensitive photographs used to train iRobot vacuum cleaners, including of a young woman sitting on the toilet, have been shared on social media. The discovery prompted privacy advocates to question the effectiveness of iRobot data protection practices, and shed light on the data training industry supply chain.
- MIT Technology Review writes that the images were taken by development versions of iRobot’s Roomba J7 series robot vacuum, and were posted online by Venezuelan contractors to San Francisco-based Scale AI, a start-up that uses low-cost gig workers to annotate audio, photo, and video data used to train artificial intelligence systems.
- According to iRobot, the photos came from 'special development robots with hardware and software modifications that are not and never were present on iRobot consumer products for purchase.' The images, the company says, were 'shared in violation of a written non-disclosure agreement between iRobot and an image annotation service provider.'
- iRobot declined to share the consent agreements with Technology Review, nor make any of its paid collectors or employees available to discuss their understanding of the terms. However, a follow-up article cites iRobot beta testers has 'failed spectacularly' to mention that personal images of their homes and children will be seen and analysed by other humans.
- iRobot CEO Colin Angle later confirmed the company terminated its relationship with Scale AI as a result of the incident.

- 
- Roomba is a series of autonomous robotic vacuum cleaners made by the company iRobot. Introduced in September 2002,[1] they have a set of sensors that enable them to navigate the floor area of a home. These sensors can detect the presence of obstacles, particularly dirty spots on the floor, and steep drops (e.g., to avoid falling down stairs).
- As of 2022, iRobot markets models of their 600, i, j, Combo and s9 series, while continuing to provide support and sell accessories for their previous series.[2] Various models have different features, including tangle-free brushes, separate sweep canisters, more powerful vacuums, obstacle avoidance, and performance maps displayed via smartphone apps. Newer high-end models also have a camera, which works in conjunction with onboard mapping and navigation software to systematically cover all floor area, move from room to room, avoid obstacles such as pet waste and charging cables, and find recharging bases and beacons.[3]
- Roombas allow some customizability and reprogramming. Parts of some models are interchangeable, allowing owners to mix and match features, or switch to other units for longer battery operation. Additionally, some units can be adapted to perform more creative tasks using an embedded computer in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.
- Most Roomba models are of a disk shape, measuring 338–353 millimetres (13.3–13.9 in) in diameter and 86–94 millimetres (3.4–3.7 in) high depending on the model. The S9 and S9+ robots are D-shaped rather than circular, with the flat part of the D at the front, and are narrower at 311 millimetres (12.2 in) wide. A large contact-sensing mechanical bumper is mounted on the front half of all models, with an omnidirectional infrared sensor at its top front center. Most models also have a recessed handle on top.[4]
- First- and second-generation Roombas were not compatible with the Virtual Wall, an accessory used to prevent them from entering an area. It projects a pattern of infrared light,[5] which the vacuum detects and treats as a physical wall, prompting it to stop and turn around. Third-generation and newer models are compatible with the Dual Mode Virtual Wall, which, in addition to simulating a straight wall, can create a circular barrier roughly 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter. Some 500-, 700- and 800-series models are compatible with the Virtual Wall Lighthouse.[6][7] It initially confines the vacuum to one area to be cleaned; then, once the vacuum reports the area has been sufficiently cleaned (based on its estimated area), it directs it to proceed to the next space to be cleaned, and contains it there.[8]
- All Roomba models can be operated by pressing the "Clean" button on the top while the Roomba is on the charging base, causing it to reverse off of the base and begin cleaning; or by manually carrying the Roomba to the room to be cleaned and pressing the button. Later models introduced several additional operating modes, such as "Spot", which cleans an area of a few feet, and "Max", which cleans endlessly until the battery is depleted; this mode was only available on older Roombas. "Dock" mode, introduced with the third generation, instructs the Roomba to seek a charging base for recharging. The availability of the modes varies by model. Many second- and third-generation Roombas, and certain newer models (such as the 880),[9] come packaged with infrared remote controls or special control panels, allowing a human operator to "drive" the Roomba to areas to be specially cleaned. Subsequent Roomba models can be controlled with the iRobot HOME app, where users can start and pause the Roomba, send it back to the charging base, choose time limits for it to run before returning home, and view details about each cleaning job (such as how long the Roomba ran for and how the job ended, such as being completed, canceled or the battery dying.)
- Roombas are driven by two independently-operating side wheels, which can drive the Roomba forwards and backwards as well as perform turns of any radius, including 360° turns in place. Rotary encoders on the wheels can detect the rate at which the wheels are spinning so it can determine if they're slipping or stuck, and drop sensors detect if a wheel is too low (such as getting stuck in a vent). An undriven swivel caster (located at the front of most models, and at the back of the D-shaped S series) is used not for steering, as is often believed, but as an additional sensor. It too is a rotary encoder; the caster's wheel is half black and half white, and optical sensors detect the change in color as it rotates. This helps detect if the Roomba is stuck or beached (i.e., the drive wheels are spinning but the Roomba isn't moving).
- The cleaning head (brushes and suction area) on Roombas is relatively small. On most models, it is between the two side wheels, and is around 5–8 inches (13–20 cm) wide; on the S series, it is moved to the flat square part of the D shape near the front where it is wider, but still does not extend the full width of the vehicle. To compensate for this, Roombas have a rotating multi-pronged brush on one side which sweeps debris towards the path of the cleaning head, helping to clean a wider path and to reach into edges and corners.
- Roombas before the seventh-generation models do not map out the rooms they are cleaning. Instead, iRobot developed a technology called iAdapt Responsive Cleaning Technology.[10] This relies on a few simple algorithms, such as spiraling, room crossing, wall following, and random walk angle changing after bumping into an object or wall. This design is based on MIT researcher and iRobot CTO Rodney Brooks's philosophy that robots should be like insects, equipped with simple control mechanisms tuned to their environments. The result is that although Roombas are effective at cleaning rooms, they take several times longer to do the job than a human would. The Roomba may cover some areas many times, other areas only once or twice, and may miss some areas. However, the random algorithm has been shown to effectively cover rooms of various sizes and configurations, particularly when used repeatedly for maintenance cleaning. (Some users have used long-exposure photography or compositing to create images showing Roombas' coverage of the floor,[11] and have even attached light sources to Roombas to create art using light painting.[12][13] Some have also noted that doubts about the effectiveness of the random algorithms have been assuaged by multiple reports of Roombas rolling over dog feces and spreading it through the room, which rather unpleasantly illustrate how well the Roomba can cover the floor's area.[14][15]) Roombas have become a common example of how randomized algorithms can probabilistically succeed even though they cannot absolutely guarantee success on any single run or even after many repeated runs. Compared to competing products available when Roombas were first introduced such as the Electrolux Trilobite, the effectiveness of Roombas' random navigation was on par with (or even more effective than) robotic mapping technology available at the time, and being cheaper to develop and produce, could be offered at a significantly lower price.[16]
- Starting with the seventh generation, Roombas have an upwards-facing camera and a downward facing infrared floor-tracking sensor which are used to create a map of the floor.[17] This enables them to use a more efficient back-and-forth cleaning pattern, which is faster and more efficient as it ensures more complete coverage without needing to cover an area multiple times. The floor-tracking sensor operates like an optical mouse and can provide precise movement data over small distances, but suffers from integration drift: small errors in measurement which accumulate over time. To rectify this, the upwards-facing camera is used periodically to identify waypoints or "landmarks", coarse points that are used to correct the Roombas' position and map.[17][18] Some algorithms such as wall following are still used, partly to assist in mapping the floor and also simply to make sure the floor is cleaned along the edge and around obstacles. Unlike other mapping systems like lidar which can operate in complete darkness, Roombas' camera requires some light in the room in order to be able to map it. Starting with the eighth generation, Roombas retain the map after each run, and use subsequent runs to improve the map. Multiple maps can be stored, and users can edit maps to separate and label regions (such as rooms), which can be used to have the Roomba clean only a selected room.
- The Roombas' bumper allows them to sense when they have bumped into an obstacle, after which they will reverse or change paths. Infrared "cliff sensors" on the bottom of Roombas similarly prevent them from falling off ledges such as stairways. (These may also trigger a false positive on dark or black colored surfaces such as some carpets, preventing Roombas from entering or being able to clean those areas.) Third-generation and newer models have additional forward-looking infrared sensors to detect obstacles. These slow down the Roomba when nearing obstacles, to reduce its force of impact.[19] It's also used to clean alongside walls without bumping into the wall repeatedly. This technology is also able to distinguish between hard and soft obstacles.[citation needed]
- Most second- and third-generation models and all newer ones have internal acoustic-based dirt sensors that allow them to detect particularly dirty spots and focus on those areas accordingly. Fourth-generation and newer models have an optical sensor located in front of the vacuum bin, allowing detection of wider and smaller messes.[20]
- The cleaning time depends on room size and, for models equipped with dirt sensors, volume of dirt. First-generation models must be told the room size, while subsequent models either estimate room size by measuring the longest straight-line run they can perform without bumping into an object or create an accurate map of the room. When finished cleaning, or when the battery is nearly depleted, Roombas except for first-generation models will try to return to a base if one is detected. Roombas with mapping capability can also recharge and resume a cleaning job, enabling them to clean large areas that take more than one full battery of charge to complete. Roombas except for first-generation models also support scheduling, allowing cleaning to start at the time of day and on days of the week that the owner desires. Most 500-series models support scheduling through buttons on the unit itself, and higher-end models allow the use of a remote control, smartphone app, or smart-home automation integration to program schedules.
- Roombas are not designed for deep-pile carpet.[citation needed] Also, the first- and second-generation Roombas can get stuck on rug tassels and electrical cords.[citation needed] Third-generation and newer models are able to reverse their brushes to escape entangled cords and tassels. All models are designed to be low enough to go under a bed or most other items of furniture. If at any time the unit senses that it has become stuck,[21] is unable to turn its main brushes, no longer senses the floor beneath it, or decides that it has worked its way into a narrow area from which it is unable to escape, it stops and sounds an error to help someone find it. Early models use only flashing lights or a number of beeps to indicate specific problems, while later models use a synthesized voice to announce a problem and a suggested solution.[22] The voice is available in several languages.
- Roombas require regular cleaning and maintenance. Because they are smaller and less powerful than large upright vacuums, the dustbin must be emptied frequently (sometimes as often as every single use), and hair and other obstructions must be removed from rollers and brushes more frequently. Some reviewers have complained about this necessity compared to traditional upright vacuums that only need infrequent cleaning and almost no maintenance; however others have countered that the chore is not difficult, and that it takes significantly less time to clean a Roomba than it does to vacuum by hand.
- iRobot has been praised for the availability of replacement parts for Roombas, with official parts still being sold for every model including the first-generation Roombas, almost 20 years after their release.[23]
- Roombas are powered by a user-replaceable rechargeable battery; older models used NiMH batteries, while newer models use lithium-ion batteries, and a few models support both. First-generation models must be recharged from a wall power adapter, while all subsequent models have a self-charging homebase that the unit seeks out at the end of a cleaning session via infrared beacons. Charging takes about three hours.[24]
- As opposed to hacking and extending Roomba, non Desktop users[25] can use the iRobot HOME App,[26] although only certain models support 5 GHz.[27] Wi-Fi connected Roombas can also connect to Alexa, Google Home, and other smart home platforms for voice control or use in automations.[28]
- Battery reliability is a frequently mentioned complaint on customer review websites.[29] Battery replacements from iRobot cost a significant fraction of the purchase price of a new Roomba, though compatible third-party batteries are available at a lower price. The iRobot customer support website offers advice on maximizing battery performance and longevity.[30]
- As of 2022,[update] there have been ten generations of Roomba units.[31] All models have a patented design using pair of brushes or rollers, rotating in opposite directions, to pick up debris from the floor.[23] In some models, the brushes are followed by a squeegee vacuum, which directs the airflow through a narrow slit to increase its speed in order to collect fine dust. A horizontally mounted "side spinner" brush on the right side of the unit sweeps against walls to reach debris not accessible by the main brushes and vacuum. In the first generation, the dirty air passes through the fan before reaching the filter, while later models use a fan-bypass vacuum.
- The early generation models were noted for using a random algorithm for achieving a total room coverage.[32]
A small vacuum empties into a removable dustbin, which has rotation brushes to aid collection.[32] The robot is propelled by two knobby rubber wheels at the edges.[32] It has several sensors including a bumper that detects collision and an infrared sensor on top to respond to a "virtual wall".[32] The robot is powered by a rechargeable battery contained in the unit.[32]
- Introduced in September 2002, the first-generation Roomba had three buttons for room size. The first-generation units comprised the original silver-colored Roomba, the blue Roomba Pro, and the maroon Roomba Pro Elite. The later two models included additional accessories, but all three used the same core robot and cleaning system.
- An original roomba model robotic vacuum is in the collection of the National Museum of American History, which they note as the first successful domestic robot.[33] The robot vacuum is described as being able to change direction when it encounters an obstacle or infrared beam, and is powered by a battery.[33]
- The second-generation Roombas ("Discovery", later called 400 series) replaced their predecessors in July 2004, added a larger dust bin, improved software that calculates room size, dirt detection, and fast charging in the home base. Room size is detected automatically based on the longest straight-line path that can be driven; instead of buttons for room size, their buttons are "Clean", "Spot", and "Max".
- Roomba budget models (Dirt Dog and Model 401) used a simplified interface (a single "Clean" button) and lacked some of the software-controlled flexibility of other versions. They were less expensive models intended for first-time purchasers. The Roomba Dirt Dog contained sweeping brushes and a larger dust bin, but lacked the vacuum motor, using the space that would be required for the vacuum for additional dust bin volume. It was designed for a home shop or garage environment.[6] The Roomba Model 401 was similar but had a standard-size dust bin and vacuum system. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in 2010.
- The 500 series was introduced in August 2007[6] and featured a forward-looking infrared sensor to detect obstacles and reduce speed, a docking command button, improved mechanical components, smoother operation, and a modular design to facilitate part replacement.[6][34] The Roombas' speed is also increased, which is possible in part because of the sensors to avoid bumping into obstacles too hard. It also introduced customizable decorative face plates.[6] The Roomba 530 included two virtual walls and a charging dock.[6]
- This model also included a newer version of the navigation software, now called iAdapt.
- There are several types of dust and debris collection bins for the 500 series models. The standard vacuum bin incorporates a squeegee vacuum.  The high-capacity sweeper bin does not include a vacuum, but has greater debris capacity. The AeroVac Bin directs suction airflow through the main brushes instead of using a squeegee, which is thought to keep the brushes cleaner.
- In August 2012, the 500 series was superseded by the 600 series, which added the AeroVac Bin and advanced cleaning head as standard features. In 2017, iRobot released the 690, which has Wi-Fi connectivity, so it can be started with an app and some personal-assistant software.[35] As of 2023, iRobot continues to market some 600 series models as budget models, with Wi-Fi connectivity.
- The 700 series, introduced in May 2011, though largely similar to the 500 and 600 series, included a more robust cleaning system, improved AeroVac Bin with HEPA filter, and improved battery life. Like the 500 series, the 700 series had models with different technologies and accessories. The Roomba 760 was the simplest model, and the Roombas 780 and 790[36] were the most advanced with both scheduling and a large range of accessories including lighthouses, wireless command center (also compatible with select retrofitted 500-series models), and extra brushes and filters. Besides these two models, Roomba 770 and 782e were available, with scheduling, Dirt Detect, and full bin indicator.
- The 800 series, introduced in 2013, is similar to the 700 series and its predecessors, but contains updated technology. The AeroForce Performance Cleaning System, which is five times more powerful than older series,[46] and the iRobot XLife battery are some of the new features. The AeroForce system does away with the large rotating brush, and pulls air between two rubber rollers, thereby getting the vacuum suction closer to the floor. In 2017 iRobot released the 890 with Wi-Fi connectivity that can be started with an app and various personal-assistant software.[35]
- The Roomba 980 was released in September 2015, and contains a new visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) navigation system, which allows it to clean an entire level of a home more efficiently. The 980 also features Wi-Fi connectivity and an iPhone and Android app.[60] The Roomba 960 was released on August 4, 2016.[61] As of March 29, 2017, 900 series users can receive detailed cleaning maps of their Roomba through the app. The maps show exact areas of clean and dirty spots in the home, allowing the Roomba to know where it needs to spend more time cleaning. However, the maps are not retained between cleaning runs, and each time the Roomba is run it builds a new map from scratch. Push notifications of when the Roomba is finished cleaning is also a new feature. Integration to Amazon's Echo was also announced, launching in spring 2017.[62]
- In September 2018, iRobot introduced a new Roomba series with three models: the premium i7, the less expensive i3, and the more basic e5.[72] Each of these models also having a "plus" version that featured an automatic dirt disposing station which could be emptied. Similarly to the 900 series, the i7 uses vSLAM navigation. This feature retains the map after the Roomba has run, and uses subsequent runs to improve the map. This lets users select which room for Roomba to clean from the iRobot Home app. In September 2020, iRobot released the i3, which is a lower cost robot similar to the i7. The i3 does not use vSLAM navigation but relies on a downward optical encoder and gyroscopes;[73] in addition it does not allow selecting specific rooms.[74] The i7 and i3 are compatible with the Clean Base, a base that empties the Roomba's bin into the Clean Base's internal disposable bag when it docks using a powerful vacuum. iRobot claims that the base can empty the Roomba's bin up to 30 cleaning cycles.[75] The + in some models indicates that it includes the Clean Base. The basic e5 Roomba replaces the 800 series with an improved battery life from 60 to 90 minutes of run time on hardwood floors using a lithium-ion battery.[76] It navigates in random patterns similar to the 6th generation and older robots.[77]
- In late May 2019, iRobot introduced the Roomba s9 and s9+ as the "smartest, most powerful robot vacuum yet".[98] The S series features a newly designed "D" shape and corner brush for optimized edge cleaning deep into corners and along edges. Other new features include an anti-allergen system that traps 99% of pollen, mold and allergens, 40 times the suction compared to the 600 series, 30% wider rubber brushes, and the most advanced navigation system to date.[98] Similar to the I series, the s9+ comes with the self-emptying Clean Base. The S series also includes linking technology that allows the Roomba to communicate wirelessly with other iRobot products, where the Braava Jet M6 can automatically be set to mop after the s9 has finished vacuuming.
- The j7 and j7+ models went on sale in September 2021, debuted Precision Vision: the navigation system that detects and avoids obstacles like power cords and pet waste. The j7 is a direct upgrade to the Roomba i7, with the same overall body design and rated ten times the suction compared to the standard model.[99] iRobot simultaneously removed the i7 from its website.
- In September 2022, iRobot announced the Roomba Combo j7+, which is a Roomba j7+ that includes mopping capabilities with a lifting mop. Shipping began on October 4.[100]
- From the earliest models on, Roomba vacuum cleaning robots have been hacked to extend their functionality. The first adaptations were based on a microcontroller that was directly connected to the motor drivers and sensors.[106] Versions manufactured after October 2005 contain an electronic and software interface that allows hackers to more easily control or modify behavior and remotely monitor its sensors.[107] One early application was using the device to map a room.[108] The native code for Roomba is written in a dialect of Lisp.[109]
- Models with an interface (400 series since October 2007 plus 500 and 700 series) come with a Mini-DIN connector supporting a serial interface, which is electrically and physically incompatible with standard PC/Mac serial ports and cables. However, third-party adapters are available to access the Roomba's computer via Bluetooth, USB, or RS-232 (PC/Mac serial).[110]  Roombas pre-October 2005 upgraded with the OSMO hacker[111] device allow monitoring many sensors and modifying the unit's behavior. The Roomba Open Interface (OI, formerly Roomba Serial Command Interface) allows programmers and roboticists to create their own enhancements.[112] Several projects are described on Roomba hacking sites.[113]
- In response to the growing interest of hackers in their product, the company developed the iRobot Create. In this model the vacuum cleaner motor is replaced by a "cargo bay" for mounting devices like TV cameras, lasers and other robotic parts.  It provides a greatly enhanced 25-pin interface providing both analog and digital bidirectional communication with the hosted device allowing use as the mobile base for completely new robots. Together with a computing platform like a netbook or handheld device with wireless networking, it can be remotely controlled through a network.[114]

- It has long been my goal to build robots that help people in their daily lives by fitting into their routines seamlessly – robots that know what job to do, and just do it. Since the launch of Roomba two decades ago, iRobot has been doing that, and since then we’ve worked continuously to make our robots smarter, more capable and more helpful.
- Our aim is to deliver a truly personalized experience, allowing people to clean when, where and how they want. Today, Roomba is smart enough to know how to clean specific rooms or particularly messy areas like “around the couch.” Robots like the Roomba j7 Series can recognize and avoid obstacles (shoes, socks, cables, pet bowls and more) to make sure the job gets done. Our robots can understand their environment, recognize more than 80 common objects in the home and react accordingly to provide the best cleaning experience possible.
- How do our robots get so smart? It starts during the development process, and as part of that, through the collection of data to train machine learning algorithms. Collecting this data enables us to build the intelligence inside our products that powers features like object recognition and avoidance, room identification and customized cleaning suggestions.
- Creating and enhancing this amazing partnership between people and robots will always require the collection of real-world data, and we strive to do that securely.
- If you read an article about images from iRobot development robots and have questions, I hope this blog will shed some light. The images included in a recent MIT Technology Review article are from iRobot development robots used by paid data collectors and employees in 2020. They were leaked externally by an image annotation service provider. iRobot is terminating its relationship with the service provider, is actively investigating the matter and taking measures to help prevent a similar leak by any service provider in the future.
- We asked that MIT Technology Review withhold publication of the sensitive images, particularly the image with a child and the image of the person in the bathroom, due to the fact that they were improperly shared. Despite our request, they moved forward with including the images in the story. We deeply regret these images were shared in this manner and have alerted the employee and other data collector impacted by the leak.
- It’s very important to note that:
- You may be aware that our newest robot vacuums, the Roomba j7 series, allow customers to opt-in to choose and submit images for machine learning purposes. While those images will be used to train machine learning algorithms in the future, they are not currently being used to do so. These images are only collected when a customer chooses to submit them.
- We take data privacy and security very seriously – not only with our customers but in every aspect of our business, including research and development. iRobot has stringent measures in place governing how we manage the data collected from research development robots, and we take precautions to ensure that personal data is processed securely and in accordance with applicable law.
- Our customers invite us into their most personal spaces – their homes – because they trust that our products will help them do more. iRobot takes that trust seriously. That’s why security and privacy features are built into our products from the beginning of the development process.
- You can learn more about iRobot’s commitment to privacy here: https://about.irobot.com/en-us/legal/privacy-principles.
- There is always a solution, always.
- Colin Angle it is irrelevant if the pictures came from a regular robot or from a dev unit. 

YOU are responsible.

Blaming contractors, blaming Tech Review and blaming your testers just confirms your ignorance concerning data privacy. It was your fault that these pictures were shared unpixelated with externals, that you have not implemented DLP and so on.

Your statement "We take data privacy and security very seriously – not only with our customers but in every aspect of our business, including research and development." is a joke because when smth happens (and it happened. Not just once.) You do not feel responsible.

Am happy that had the right gut feeling and decided AGAINST a iRobot.

- Is it true that you shared pictures of minors without explicit consent from their parents, with 3rd party contractors?

- The linked Privacy Principles on transparency it states "We’re clear about what information we collect and why we collect it, always proactively communicating with you." Do you think this instance was handled proactively? It also states "The data we collect is kept safe using the highest industry standards—and used to improve your experience and your robot’s performance." The standards in place should be the same standards your testing community experiences.  Why was this breach not communicated to the broader tester community when the breach itself implies your governance over third parties is insufficient?  It's clear from the article that data is not only going to third parties but is being sent outside of the countries the data was collected in, where laws and regulations differ & loosen controls that iRobot should have in place.  Essentially... why should a customer think that their privacy will be respected when this breach proves there is a lack of transparency, that proactive communications are not happening, that there is a lax policy and enforcement by iRobot for governance and auditing of its vendor relationships?  There are multiple failures here that your article does not address. This is not responsible development.

- So what happens if an account holder opts in to sharing the images without informing anyone else? Does the robot have a 'recording light' when the images are gathered? Let's say I'm a house guest or someone who can't/didn't consent, will I know that I'm being recorded? I don't own one so I'm not sure how the image submission process works.

- Robot vacuum companies say your images are safe, but a sprawling global supply chain for data from our devices creates risk.
- In the fall of 2020, gig workers in Venezuela posted a series of images to online forums where they gathered to talk shop. The photos were mundane, if sometimes intimate, household scenes captured from low angles—including some you really wouldn’t want shared on the Internet.
- In one particularly revealing shot, a young woman in a lavender T-shirt sits on the toilet, her shorts pulled down to mid-thigh.
- The images were not taken by a person, but by development versions of iRobot’s Roomba J7 series robot vacuum. They were then sent to Scale AI, a startup that contracts workers around the world to label audio, photo, and video data used to train artificial intelligence.
- They were the sorts of scenes that internet-connected devices regularly capture and send back to the cloud—though usually with stricter storage and access controls. Yet earlier this year, MIT Technology Review obtained 15 screenshots of these private photos, which had been posted to closed social media groups.
- The photos vary in type and in sensitivity. The most intimate image we saw was the series of video stills featuring the young woman on the toilet, her face blocked in the lead image but unobscured in the grainy scroll of shots below. In another image, a boy who appears to be eight or nine years old, and whose face is clearly visible, is sprawled on his stomach across a hallway floor. A triangular flop of hair spills across his forehead as he stares, with apparent amusement, at the object recording him from just below eye level.
- The other shots show rooms from homes around the world, some occupied by humans, one by a dog. Furniture, décor, and objects located high on the walls and ceilings are outlined by rectangular boxes and accompanied by labels like “tv,” “plant_or_flower,” and “ceiling light.”
- iRobot—the world’s largest vendor of robotic vacuums, which Amazon recently acquired for $1.7 billion in a pending deal—confirmed that these images were captured by its Roombas in 2020. All of them came from “special development robots with hardware and software modifications that are not and never were present on iRobot consumer products for purchase,” the company said in a statement. They were given to “paid collectors and employees” who signed written agreements acknowledging that they were sending data streams, including video, back to the company for training purposes. According to iRobot, the devices were labeled with a bright green sticker that read “video recording in progress,” and it was up to those paid data collectors to “remove anything they deem sensitive from any space the robot operates in, including children.”
- Did you participate in iRobot's data collection efforts? We'd love to hear from you. Please reach out at tips@technologyreview.com.
- In other words, by iRobot’s estimation, anyone whose photos or video appeared in the streams had agreed to let their Roombas monitor them. iRobot declined to let MIT Technology Review view the consent agreements and did not make any of its paid collectors or employees available to discuss their understanding of the terms.
- While the images shared with us did not come from iRobot customers, consumers regularly consent to having our data monitored to varying degrees on devices ranging from iPhones to washing machines. It’s a practice that has only grown more common over the past decade, as data-hungry artificial intelligence has been increasingly integrated into a whole new array of products and services. Much of this technology is based on machine learning, a technique that uses large troves of data—including our voices, faces, homes, and other personal information—to train algorithms to recognize patterns. The most useful data sets are the most realistic, making data sourced from real environments, like homes, especially valuable. Often, we opt in simply by using the product, as noted in privacy policies with vague language that gives companies broad discretion in how they disseminate and analyze consumer information.
- The data collected by robot vacuums can be particularly invasive. They have “powerful hardware, powerful sensors,” says Dennis Giese, a PhD candidate at Northeastern University who studies the security vulnerabilities of Internet of Things devices, including robot vacuums. “And they can drive around in your home—and you have no way to control that.” This is especially true, he adds, of devices with advanced cameras and artificial intelligence—like iRobot’s Roomba J7 series.
- An MIT Technology Review investigation recently revealed how images of a minor and a tester on the toilet ended up on social media. iRobot said it had consent to collect this kind of data from inside homes—but participants say otherwise.
- This data is then used to build smarter robots whose purpose may one day go far beyond vacuuming. But to make these data sets useful for machine learning, individual humans must first view, categorize, label, and otherwise add context to each bit of data. This process is called data annotation.
- “There’s always a group of humans sitting somewhere—usually in a windowless room, just doing a bunch of point-and-click: ‘Yes, that is an object or not an object,’” explains Matt Beane, an assistant professor in the technology management program at  the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies the human work behind robotics.
- The 15 images shared with MIT Technology Review are just a tiny slice of a sweeping data ecosystem. iRobot has said that it has shared over 2 million images with Scale AI and an unknown quantity more with other data annotation platforms; the company has confirmed that Scale is just one of the data annotators it has used.
- James Baussmann, iRobot’s spokesperson, said in an email the company had “taken every precaution to ensure that personal data is processed securely and in accordance with applicable law,” and that the images shared with MIT Technology Review were “shared in violation of a written non-disclosure agreement between iRobot and an image annotation service provider.” In an emailed statement a few weeks after we shared the images with the company, iRobot CEO Colin Angle said that “iRobot is terminating its relationship with the service provider who leaked the images, is actively investigating the matter, and [is] taking measures to help prevent a similar leak by any service provider in the future.” The company did not respond to additional questions about what those measures were.
- Ultimately, though, this set of images represents something bigger than any one individual company’s actions. They speak to the widespread, and growing, practice of sharing potentially sensitive data to train algorithms, as well as the surprising, globe-spanning journey that a single image can take—in this case, from homes in North America, Europe, and Asia to the servers of Massachusetts-based iRobot, from there to San Francisco–based Scale AI, and finally to Scale’s contracted data workers around the world (including, in this instance, Venezuelan gig workers who posted the images to private groups on Facebook, Discord, and elsewhere).
- Together, the images reveal a whole data supply chain—and new points where personal information could leak out—that few consumers are even aware of.
- “It’s not expected that human beings are going to be reviewing the raw footage,” emphasizes Justin Brookman, director of tech policy at Consumer Reports and former policy director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Office of Technology Research and Investigation. iRobot would not say whether data collectors were aware that humans, in particular, would be viewing these images, though the company said the consent form made clear that “service providers” would be.
- “It’s not expected that human beings are going to be reviewing the raw footage.”
- “We literally treat machines differently than we treat humans,” adds Jessica Vitak, an information scientist and professor at the University of Maryland’s communication department and its College of Information Studies. “It’s much easier for me to accept a cute little vacuum, you know, moving around my space [than] somebody walking around my house with a camera.”
- And yet, that’s essentially what is happening. It’s not just a robot vacuum watching you on the toilet—a person may be looking too.
- Robot vacuums weren’t always so smart.
- The earliest model, the Swedish-made Electrolux Trilobite, came to market in 2001. It used ultrasonic sensors to locate walls and plot cleaning patterns; additional bump sensors on its sides and cliff sensors at the bottom helped it avoid running into objects or falling off stairs. But these sensors were glitchy, leading the robot to miss certain areas or repeat others. The result was unfinished and unsatisfactory cleaning jobs.
- The next year, iRobot released the first-generation Roomba, which relied on similar basic bump sensors and turn sensors. Much cheaper than its competitor, it became the first commercially successful robot vacuum.
- The most basic models today still operate similarly, while midrange cleaners incorporate better sensors and other navigational techniques like simultaneous localization and mapping to find their place in a room and chart out better cleaning paths.
- Higher-end devices have moved on to computer vision, a subset of artificial intelligence that approximates human sight by training algorithms to extract information from images and videos, and/or lidar, a laser-based sensing technique used by NASA and widely considered the most accurate—but most expensive—navigational technology on the market today.
- Computer vision depends on high-definition cameras, and by our count, around a dozen companies have incorporated front-facing cameras into their robot vacuums for navigation and object recognition—as well as, increasingly, home monitoring. This includes the top three robot vacuum makers by market share: iRobot, which has 30% of the market and has sold over 40 million devices since 2002; Ecovacs, with about 15%; and Roborock, which has about another 15%, according to the market intelligence firm Strategy Analytics. It also includes familiar household appliance makers like Samsung, LG, and Dyson, among others. In all, some 23.4 million robot vacuums were sold in Europe and the Americas in 2021 alone, according to Strategy Analytics.
- From the start, iRobot went all in on computer vision, and its first device with such capabilities, the Roomba 980, debuted in 2015. It was also the first of iRobot’s Wi-Fi-enabled devices, as well as its first that could map a home, adjust its cleaning strategy on the basis of room size, and identify basic obstacles to avoid.
- Computer vision “allows the robot to … see the full richness of the world around it,” says Chris Jones, iRobot’s chief technology officer. It allows iRobot’s devices to “avoid cords on the floor or understand that that’s a couch.”
- But for computer vision in robot vacuums to truly work as intended, manufacturers need to train it on high-quality, diverse data sets that reflect the huge range of what they might see. “The variety of the home environment is a very difficult task,” says Wu Erqi, the senior R&D director of Beijing-based Roborock. Road systems “are quite standard,” he says, so for makers of self-driving cars, “you’ll know how the lane looks … [and] how the traffic sign looks.” But each home interior is vastly different.
- “The furniture is not standardized,” he adds. “You cannot expect what will be on your ground. Sometimes there’s a sock there, maybe some cables”—and the cables may look different in the US and China.
- MIT Technology Review spoke with or sent questions to 12 companies selling robot vacuums and found that they respond to the challenge of gathering training data differently.
- In iRobot’s case, over 95% of its image data set comes from real homes, whose residents are either iRobot employees or volunteers recruited by third-party data vendors (which iRobot declined to identify). People using development devices agree to allow iRobot to collect data, including video streams, as the devices are running, often in exchange for “incentives for participation,” according to a statement from iRobot. The company declined to specify what these incentives were, saying only that they varied “based on the length and complexity of the data collection.”
- The remaining training data comes from what iRobot calls “staged data collection,” in which the company builds models that it then records.
- iRobot has also begun offering regular consumers the opportunity to opt in to contributing training data through its app, where people can choose to send specific images of obstacles to company servers to improve its algorithms. iRobot says that if a customer participates in this “user-in-the-loop” training, as it is known, the company receives only these specific images, and no others. Baussmann, the company representative, said in an email that such images have not yet been used to train any algorithms.
- In contrast to iRobot, Roborock said that it either “produce[s] [its] own images in [its] labs” or “work[s] with third-party vendors in China who are specifically asked to capture & provide images of objects on floors for our training purposes.” Meanwhile, Dyson, which sells two high-end robot vacuum models, said that it gathers data from two main sources: “home trialists within Dyson’s research & development department with a security clearance” and, increasingly, synthetic, or AI-generated, training data.
- Most robot vacuum companies MIT Technology Review spoke with explicitly said they don’t use customer data to train their machine-learning algorithms. Samsung did not respond to questions about how it sources its data (though it wrote that it does not use Scale AI for data annotation), while Ecovacs calls the source of its training data “confidential.” LG and Bosch did not respond to requests for comment.
- “You have to assume that people … ask each other for help. The policy always says that you’re not supposed to, but it’s very hard to control.”
- Some clues about other methods of data collection come from Giese, the IoT hacker, whose office at Northeastern is piled high with robot vacuums that he has reverse-engineered, giving him access to their machine-learning models. Some are produced by Dreame, a relatively new Chinese company based in Shenzhen that sells affordable, feature-rich devices.
- Giese found that Dreame vacuums have a folder labeled “AI server,” as well as image upload functions. Companies often say that “camera data is never sent to the cloud and whatever,” Giese says, but “when I had access to the device, I was basically able to prove that it's not true.” Even if they didn’t actually upload any photos, he adds, “[the function] is always there.”
- As the demand for data labeling exploded, an economic catastrophe turned Venezuela into ground zero for a new model of labor exploitation.
- Dreame manufactures robot vacuums that are also rebranded and sold by other companies—an indication that this practice could be employed by other brands as well, says Giese.
- Dreame did not respond to emailed questions about the data collected from customer devices, but in the days following MIT Technology Review’s initial outreach, the company began changing its privacy policies, including those related to how it collects personal information, and pushing out multiple firmware updates.
- But without either an explanation from companies themselves or a way, besides hacking, to test their assertions, it’s hard to know for sure what they’re collecting from customers for training purposes.
- With the raw data required for machine-learning algorithms comes the need for labor, and lots of it. That’s where data annotation comes in. A young but growing industry, data annotation is projected to reach $13.3 billion in market value by 2030.
- The field took off largely to meet the huge need for labeled data to train the algorithms used in self-driving vehicles. Today, data labelers, who are often low-paid contract workers in the developing world, help power much of what we take for granted as “automated” online. They keep the worst of the Internet out of our social media feeds by manually categorizing and flagging posts, improve voice recognition software by transcribing low-quality audio, and help robot vacuums recognize objects in their environments by tagging photos and videos.
- Among the myriad companies that have popped up over the past decade, Scale AI has become the market leader. Founded in 2016, it built a business model around contracting with remote workers in less-wealthy nations at cheap project- or task-based rates on Remotasks, its proprietary crowdsourcing platform.
- In 2020, Scale posted a new assignment there: Project IO. It featured images captured from the ground and angled upwards at roughly 45 degrees, and showed the walls, ceilings, and floors of homes around the world, as well as whatever happened to be in or on them—including people, whose faces were clearly visible to the labelers.
- Labelers discussed Project IO in Facebook, Discord, and other groups that they had set up to share advice on handling delayed payments, talk about the best-paying assignments, or request assistance in labeling tricky objects.
- iRobot confirmed that the 15 images posted in these groups and subsequently sent to MIT Technology Review came from its devices, sharing a spreadsheet listing the specific dates they were made (between June and November 2020), the countries they came from (the United States, Japan, France, Germany, and Spain), and the serial numbers of the devices that produced the images, as well as a column indicating that a consent form had been signed by each device’s user. (Scale AI confirmed that 13 of the 15 images came from “an R&D project [it] worked on with iRobot over two years ago,” though it declined to clarify the origins of or offer additional information on the other two images.)
- iRobot says that sharing images in social media groups violates Scale’s agreements with it, and Scale says that contract workers sharing these images breached their own agreements.
- “The underlying problem is that your face is like a password you can’t change. Once somebody has recorded the ‘signature’ of your face, they can use it forever to find you in photos or video.”
- But such actions are nearly impossible to police on crowdsourcing platforms.
- When I ask Kevin Guo, the CEO of Hive, a Scale competitor that also depends on contract workers, if he is aware of data labelers sharing content on social media, he is blunt. “These are distributed workers,” he says. “You have to assume that people … ask each other for help. The policy always says that you’re not supposed to, but it’s very hard to control.”
- That means that it’s up to the service provider to decide whether or not to take on certain work. For Hive, Guo says, “we don’t think we have the right controls in place given our workforce” to effectively protect sensitive data. Hive does not work with any robot vacuum companies, he adds.
- “It’s sort of surprising to me that [the images] got shared on a crowdsourcing platform,” says Olga Russakovsky, the principal investigator at Princeton University’s Visual AI Lab and a cofounder of the group AI4All. Keeping the labeling in house, where “folks are under strict NDAs” and “on company computers,” would keep the data far more secure, she points out.
- In other words, relying on far-flung data annotators is simply not a secure way to protect data. “When you have data that you’ve gotten from customers, it would normally reside in a database with access protection,” says Pete Warden, a leading computer vision researcher and a PhD student at Stanford University. But with machine-learning training, customer data is all combined “in a big batch,” widening the “circle of people” who get access to it.
- For its part, iRobot says that it shares only a subset of training images with data annotation partners, flags any image with sensitive information, and notifies the company’s chief privacy officer if sensitive information is detected. Baussmann calls this situation “rare,” and adds that when it does happen, “the entire video log, including the image, is deleted from iRobot servers.”
- The company specified, “When an image is discovered where a user is in a compromising position, including nudity, partial nudity, or sexual interaction, it is deleted—in addition to ALL other images from that log.” It did not clarify whether this flagging would be done automatically by algorithm or manually by a person, or why that did not happen in the case of the woman on the toilet.
- iRobot policy, however, does not deem faces sensitive, even if the people are minors.
- “In order to teach the robots to avoid humans and images of humans”—a feature that it has promoted to privacy-wary customers—the company “first needs to teach the robot what a human is,” Baussmann explained. “In this sense, it is necessary to first collect data of humans to train a model.” The implication is that faces must be part of that data.
- But facial images may not actually be necessary for algorithms to detect humans, according to William Beksi, a computer science professor who runs the Robotic Vision Laboratory at the University of Texas at Arlington: human detector models can recognize people based “just [on] the outline (silhouette) of a human.”
- “If you were a big company, and you were concerned about privacy, you could preprocess these images,” Beksi says. For example, you could blur human faces before they even leave the device and “before giving them to someone to annotate.”
- “It does seem to be a bit sloppy,” he concludes, “especially to have minors recorded in the videos.”
- In the case of the woman on the toilet, a data labeler made an effort to preserve her privacy, by placing a black circle over her face. But in no other images featuring people were identities obscured, either by the data labelers themselves, by Scale AI, or by iRobot. That includes the image of the young boy sprawled on the floor.
- Baussmann explained that iRobot protected “the identity of these humans” by “decoupling all identifying information from the images … so if an image is acquired by a bad actor, they cannot map backwards to identify the person in the image.”
- But capturing faces is inherently privacy-violating, argues Warden. “The underlying problem is that your face is like a password you can’t change,” he says. “Once somebody has recorded the ‘signature’ of your face, they can use it forever to find you in photos or video.”
- Additionally, “lawmakers and enforcers in privacy would view biometrics, including faces, as sensitive information,” says Jessica Rich, a privacy lawyer who served as director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection between 2013 and 2017. This is especially the case if any minors are captured on camera, she adds: “Getting consent from the employee [or testers] isn’t the same as getting consent from the child. The employee doesn’t have the capacity to consent to data collection about other individuals—let alone the children that appear to be implicated.” Rich says she wasn’t referring to any specific company in these comments.
- In the end, the real problem is arguably not that the data labelers shared the images on social media. Rather, it’s that this type of AI training set—specifically, one depicting faces—is far more common than most people understand, notes Milagros Miceli, a sociologist and computer scientist who has been interviewing distributed workers contracted by data annotation companies for years. Miceli was part of a research team that has spoken to multiple labelers who have seen similar images, taken from the same low vantage points and sometimes showing people in various stages of undress.
- The data labelers found this work “really uncomfortable,” she adds.
- Robot vacuum manufacturers themselves recognize the heightened privacy risks presented by on-device cameras. “When you’ve made the decision to invest in computer vision, you do have to be very careful with privacy and security,” says Jones, iRobot’s CTO. “You’re giving this benefit to the product and the consumer, but you also have to be treating privacy and security as a top-order priority.”
- In fact, iRobot tells MIT Technology Review it has implemented many privacy- and security-protecting measures in its customer devices, including using encryption, regularly patching security vulnerabilities, limiting and monitoring internal employee access to information, and providing customers with detailed information on the data that it collects.
- But there is a wide gap between the way companies talk about privacy and the way consumers understand it.
- It’s easy, for instance, to conflate privacy with security, says Jen Caltrider, the lead researcher behind Mozilla’s “*Privacy Not Included” project, which reviews consumer devices for both privacy and security. Data security refers to a product’s physical and cyber security, or how vulnerable it is to a hack or intrusion, while data privacy is about transparency—knowing and being able to control the data that companies have, how it is used, why it is shared, whether and for how long it’s retained, and how much a company is collecting to start with.
- Conflating the two is convenient, Caltrider adds, because “security has gotten better, while privacy has gotten way worse” since she began tracking products in 2017. “The devices and apps now collect so much more personal information,” she says.
- Company representatives also sometimes use subtle differences, like the distinction between “sharing” data and selling it, that make how they handle privacy particularly hard for non-experts to parse. When a company says it will never sell your data, that doesn’t mean it won’t use it or share it with others for analysis.
- These expansive definitions of data collection are often acceptable under companies’ vaguely worded privacy policies, virtually all of which contain some language permitting the use of data for the purposes of “improving products and services”—language that Rich calls so broad as to “permit basically anything.”
- “Developers are not traditionally very good [at] security stuff.” Their attitude becomes “Try to get the functionality, and if the functionality is working, ship the product. And then the scandals come out.”
- Indeed, MIT Technology Review reviewed 12 robot vacuum privacy policies, and all of them, including iRobot’s, contained similar language on “improving products and services.” Most of the companies to which MIT Technology Review reached out for comment did not respond to questions on whether “product improvement” would include machine-learning algorithms. But Roborock and iRobot say it would.
- And because the United States lacks a comprehensive data privacy law—instead relying on a mishmash of state laws, most notably the California Consumer Privacy Act—these privacy policies are what shape companies’ legal responsibilities, says Brookman. “A lot of privacy policies will say, you know, we reserve the right to share your data with select partners or service providers,” he notes. That means consumers are likely agreeing to have their data shared with additional companies, whether they are familiar with them or not.
- Brookman explains that the legal barriers companies must clear to collect data directly from consumers are fairly low. The FTC, or state attorneys general, may step in if there are either “unfair” or “deceptive” practices, he notes, but these are narrowly defined: unless a privacy policy specifically says “Hey, we’re not going to let contractors look at your data” and they share it anyway, Brookman says, companies are “probably okay on deception, which is the main way” for the FTC to “enforce privacy historically.” Proving that a practice is unfair, meanwhile, carries additional burdens—including proving harm. “The courts have never really ruled on it,” he adds.
- Most companies’ privacy policies do not even mention the audiovisual data being captured, with a few exceptions. iRobot’s privacy policy notes that it collects audiovisual data only if an individual shares images via its mobile app. LG’s privacy policy for the camera- and AI-enabled Hom-Bot Turbo+ explains that its app collects audiovisual data, including “audio, electronic, visual, or similar information, such as profile photos, voice recordings, and video recordings.” And the privacy policy for Samsung’s Jet Bot AI+ Robot Vacuum with lidar and Powerbot R7070, both of which have cameras, will collect “information you store on your device, such as photos, contacts, text logs, touch interactions, settings, and calendar information” and “recordings of your voice when you use voice commands to control a Service or contact our Customer Service team.” Meanwhile, Roborock’s privacy policy makes no mention of audiovisual data, though company representatives tell MIT Technology Review that consumers in China have the option to share it.
- iRobot cofounder Helen Greiner, who now runs a startup called Tertill that sells a garden-weeding robot, emphasizes that in collecting all this data, companies are not trying to violate their customers’ privacy. They’re just trying to build better products—or, in iRobot’s case, “make a better clean,” she says.
- Still, even the best efforts of companies like iRobot clearly leave gaps in privacy protection. “It’s less like a maliciousness thing, but just incompetence,” says Giese, the IoT hacker. “Developers are not traditionally very good [at] security stuff.” Their attitude becomes “Try to get the functionality, and if the functionality is working, ship the product.”
- “And then the scandals come out,” he adds.
- The appetite for data will only increase in the years ahead. Vacuums are just a tiny subset of the connected devices that are proliferating across our lives, and the biggest names in robot vacuums—including iRobot, Samsung, Roborock, and Dyson—are vocal about ambitions much grander than automated floor cleaning. Robotics, including home robotics, has long been the real prize.
- Consider how Mario Munich, then the senior vice president of technology at iRobot, explained the company’s goals back in 2018. In a presentation on the Roomba 980, the company’s first computer-vision vacuum, he showed images from the device’s vantage point—including one of a kitchen with a table, chairs, and stools—next to how they would be labeled and perceived by the robot’s algorithms. “The challenge is not with the vacuuming. The challenge is with the robot,” Munich explained. “We would like to know the environment so we can change the operation of the robot.”
- This bigger mission is evident in what Scale’s data annotators were asked to label—not items on the floor that should be avoided (a feature that iRobot promotes), but items like “cabinet,” “kitchen countertop,” and “shelf,” which together help the Roomba J series device recognize the entire space in which it operates.
- The companies making robot vacuums are already investing in other features and devices that will bring us closer to a robotics-enabled future. The latest Roombas can be voice controlled through Nest and Alexa, and they recognize over 80 different objects around the home. Meanwhile, Ecovacs’s Deebot X1 robot vacuum has integrated the company’s proprietary voice assistance, while Samsung is one of several companies developing “companion robots” to keep humans company. Miele, which sells the RX2 Scout Home Vision, has turned its focus toward other smart appliances, like its camera-enabled smart oven.
- And if iRobot’s $1.7 billion acquisition by Amazon moves forward—pending approval by the FTC, which is considering the merger’s effect on competition in the smart-home marketplace—Roombas are likely to become even more integrated into Amazon’s vision for the always-on smart home of the future.
- Perhaps unsurprisingly, public policy is starting to reflect the growing public concern with data privacy. From 2018 to 2022, there has been a marked increase in states considering and passing privacy protections, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. At the federal level, the FTC is considering new rules to crack down on harmful commercial surveillance and lax data security practices—including those used in training data. In two cases, the FTC has taken action against the undisclosed use of customer data to train artificial intelligence, ultimately forcing the companies, Weight Watchers International and the photo app developer Everalbum, to delete both the data collected and the algorithms built from it.
- Still, none of these piecemeal efforts address the growing data annotation market and its proliferation of companies based around the world or contracting with global gig workers, who operate with little oversight, often in countries with even fewer data protection laws.
- When I spoke this summer to Greiner, she said that she personally was not worried about iRobot’s implications for privacy—though she understood why some people might feel differently. Ultimately, she framed privacy in terms of consumer choice: anyone with real concerns could simply not buy that device.
- “Everybody needs to make their own privacy decisions,” she told me. “And I can tell you, overwhelmingly, people make the decision to have the features as long as they are delivered at a cost-effective price point.”
- But not everyone agrees with this framework, in part because it is so challenging for consumers to make fully informed choices. Consent should be more than just “a piece of paper” to sign or a privacy policy to glance through, says Vitak, the University of Maryland information scientist.
- True informed consent means “that the person fully understands the procedure, they fully understand the risks … how those risks will be mitigated, and … what their rights are,” she explains. But this rarely happens in a comprehensive way—especially when companies market adorable robot helpers promising clean floors at the click of a button.

- An MIT Technology Review investigation recently revealed how images of a minor and a tester on the toilet ended up on social media. iRobot said it had consent to collect this kind of data from inside homes—but participants say otherwise.
- When Greg unboxed a new Roomba robot vacuum cleaner in December 2019, he thought he knew what he was getting into.
- He would allow the preproduction test version of iRobot’s Roomba J series device to roam around his house, let it collect all sorts of data to help improve its artificial intelligence, and provide feedback to iRobot about his user experience.
- He had done this all before. Outside of his day job as an engineer at a software company, Greg had been beta-testing products for the past decade. He estimates that he’s tested over 50 products in that time—everything from sneakers to smart home cameras.
- “I really enjoy it,” he says. “The whole idea is that you get to learn about something new, and hopefully be involved in shaping the product, whether it’s making a better-quality release or actually defining features and functionality.”
- But what Greg didn’t know—and does not believe he consented to—was that iRobot would share test users’ data in a sprawling, global data supply chain, where everything (and every person) captured by the devices’ front-facing cameras could be seen, and perhaps annotated, by low-paid contractors outside the United States who could screenshot and share images at their will.
- Greg, who asked that we identify him only by his first name because he signed a nondisclosure agreement with iRobot, is not the only test user who feels dismayed and betrayed.
- Robot vacuum companies say your images are safe, but a sprawling global supply chain for data from our devices creates risk.
- Nearly a dozen people who participated in iRobot’s data collection efforts between 2019 and 2022 have come forward in the weeks since MIT Technology Review published an investigation into how the company uses images captured from inside real homes to train its artificial intelligence. The participants have shared similar concerns about how iRobot handled their data—and whether those practices conform with the company's own data protection promises. After all, the agreements go both ways, and whether or not the company legally violated its promises, the participants feel misled.
- “There is a real concern about whether the company is being deceptive if people are signing up for this sort of highly invasive type of surveillance and never fully understand … what they’re agreeing to,” says Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project.
- The company’s failure to adequately protect test user data feels like “a clear breach of the agreement on their side,” Greg says. It’s “a failure … [and] also a violation of trust.”
- Now, he wonders, “where is the accountability?”
- Last month MIT Technology Review revealed how iRobot collects photos and videos from the homes of test users and employees and shares them with data annotation companies, including San Francisco–based Scale AI, which hire far-flung contractors to label the data that trains the company’s artificial-intelligence algorithms.
- We found that in one 2020 project, gig workers in Venezuela were asked to label objects in a series of images of home interiors, some of which included individuals—their faces visible to the data annotators. These workers then shared at least 15 images—including shots of a minor and of a woman sitting on the toilet—to social media groups where they gathered to talk shop. We know about these particular images because the screenshots were subsequently shared with us, but our interviews with data annotators and researchers who study data annotation suggest they are unlikely to be the only ones that made their way online; it’s not uncommon for sensitive images, videos, and audio to be shared with labelers.
- Shortly after MIT Technology Review contacted iRobot for comment on the photos last fall, the company terminated its contract with Scale AI.
- Nevertheless, in a LinkedIn post in response to our story, iRobot CEO Colin Angle did not acknowledge the mere fact that these images, and the faces of test users, were visible to human gig workers was a reason for concern. Rather, he wrote, making such images available was actually necessary to train iRobot’s object recognition algorithms: “How do our robots get so smart? It starts during the development process, and as part of that, through the collection of data to train machine learning algorithms.” Besides, he pointed out, the images came not from customers but from “paid data collectors and employees” who had signed consent agreements.
- In the LinkedIn post and in statements to MIT Technology Review, Angle and iRobot have repeatedly emphasized that no customer data was shared and that “participants are informed and acknowledge how the data will be collected.”
- This attempt to clearly delineate between customers and beta testers—and how those people’s data will be treated—has been confounding to many testers, who say they consider themselves part of iRobot’s broader community and feel that the company’s comments are dismissive. Greg and the other testers who reached out also strongly dispute any implication that by volunteering to test a product, they have signed away all their privacy.
- What’s more, the line between tester and consumer is not so clear cut. At least one of the testers we spoke with enjoyed his test Roomba so much that he later purchased the device.
- This is not an anomaly; rather, converting beta testers to customers and evangelists for the product is something Centercode, the company that recruited the participants on behalf of iRobot, actively tries to promote: “It’s hard to find better potential brand ambassadors than in your beta tester community. They’re a great pool of free, authentic voices that can talk about your launched product to the world, and their (likely techie) friends,” it wrote in a marketing blog post.
- To Greg, iRobot has “failed spectacularly” in its treatment of the testing community, particularly in its silence over the privacy breach. iRobot says it has notified individuals whose photos appeared in the set of 15 images, but it did not respond to a question about whether it would notify other individuals who had taken part in its data collection. The participants who reached out to us said they have not received any kind of notice from the company.
- “If your credit card information … was stolen at Target, Target doesn’t notify the one person who has the breach,” he adds. “They send out a notification that there was a breach, this is what happened, [and] this is how they’re handling it.”
- The journey of iRobot’s AI-powering data points starts on testing platforms like Betabound, which is run by Centercode. The technology company, based in Laguna Hills, California, recruits volunteers to test out products and services for its clients—primarily consumer tech companies. (iRobot spokesperson James Baussmann confirmed that the company has used Betabound but said that “not all of the paid data collectors were recruited via Betabound.” Centercode did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)
- “If your credit card information … was stolen at Target, Target doesn’t notify the one person who has the breach.”
- As early adopters, beta testers are often more tech savvy than the average consumer. They are enthusiastic about gadgets and, like Greg, sometimes work in the technology sector themselves—so they are often well aware of the standards around data protection.
- A review of all 6,200 test opportunities listed on Betabound’s website as of late December shows that iRobot has been testing on the platform since at least 2017. The latest project, which is specifically recruiting German testers, started just last month.
- Need some help with your household chores? Our friends at iRobot have a new opportunity for German testers to try out a robotic cleaning device. To sign up with iRobot and apply, click here: https://t.co/YJbVoeSKPp#newbetatest #testing #irobot #smarthome
- iRobot’s vacuums are far from the only devices in its category. There are over 300 tests listed for other “smart” devices powered by AI, including “a smart microwave with Alexa support,” as well as multiple other robot vacuums.
- The first step for potential testers is to fill out a profile on the Betabound website. They can then apply for specific opportunities as they’re announced. If accepted by the company running the test, testers sign numerous agreements before they are sent the devices.
- Betabound testers are not paid, as the platform’s FAQ for testers notes: “Companies cannot expect your feedback to be honest and reliable if you’re being paid to give it.” Rather, testers might receive gift cards, a chance to keep their test devices free of charge, or complimentary production versions delivered after the device they tested goes to market.
- iRobot, however, did not allow testers to keep their devices, nor did they receive final products. Instead, the beta testers told us that they received gift cards in amounts ranging from $30 to $120 for running the robot vacuums multiple times a week over multiple weeks. (Baussmann says that “with respect to the amount paid to participants, it varies depending upon the work involved.”)
- For some testers, this compensation was disappointing—“even before considering … my naked ass could now be on the Internet,” as B, a tester we’re identifying only by his first initial, wrote in an email. He called iRobot “cheap bastards” for the $30 gift card that he received for his data, collected daily over three months.
- When MIT Technology Review reached out to iRobot for comment on the set of 15 images last fall, the company emphasized that each image had a corresponding consent agreement. It would not, however, share the agreements with us, citing “legal reasons.” Instead, the company said the agreement required an “acknowledgment that video and images are being captured during cleaning jobs” and that “the agreement encourages paid data collectors to remove anything they deem sensitive from any space the robot operates in, including children.”
- Test users have since shared with MIT Technology Review copies of their agreement with iRobot. These include several different forms—including a general Betabound agreement and a “global test agreement for development robots,” as well as agreements on nondisclosure, test participation, and product loan. There are also agreements for some of the specific tests being run.
- The forms do contain the language iRobot previously laid out, while also spelling out the company’s own commitments on data protection for test users. But they provide little clarity on what exactly that means, especially how the company will handle user data after it’s collected and whom the data will be shared with.
- The “global test agreement for development robots,” similar versions of which were independently shared by a half-dozen individuals who signed them between 2019 and 2022, contains the bulk of the information on privacy and consent.
- In the short document of roughly 1,300 words, iRobot notes that it is the controller of information, which comes with legal responsibilities under the EU’s GDPR to ensure that data is collected for legitimate purposes and securely stored and processed. Additionally, it states, “iRobot agrees that third-party vendors and service providers selected to process [personal information] will be vetted for privacy and data security, will be bound by strict confidentiality, and will be governed by the terms of a Data Processing Agreement,” and that users “may be entitled to additional rights under applicable privacy laws where [they] reside.”
- It’s this section of the agreement that Greg believes iRobot breached. “Where in that statement is the accountability that iRobot is proposing to the testers?” he asks. “I completely disagree with how offhandedly this is being responded to.”
- “A lot of this language seems to be designed to exempt the company from applicable privacy laws, but none of it reflects the reality of how the product operates.”
- What’s more, all test participants had to agree that their data could be used for machine learning and object detection training. Specifically, the global test agreement’s section on “use of research information” required an acknowledgment that “text, video, images, or audio … may be used by iRobot to analyze statistics and usage data, diagnose technology problems, enhance product performance, product and feature innovation, market research, trade presentations, and internal training, including machine learning and object detection.”
- What isn’t spelled out here is that iRobot carries out the machine-learning training through human data labelers who teach the algorithms, click by click, to recognize the individual elements captured in the raw data. In other words, the agreements shared with us never explicitly mention that personal images will be seen and analyzed by other humans.
- Baussmann, iRobot’s spokesperson, said that the language we highlighted “covers a variety of testing scenarios” and is not specific to images sent for data annotation. “For example, sometimes testers are asked to take photos or videos of a robot’s behavior, such as when it gets stuck on a certain object or won’t completely dock itself, and send those photos or videos to iRobot,” he wrote, adding that “for tests in which images will be captured for annotation purposes, there are specific terms that are outlined in the agreement pertaining to that test.”
- He also wrote that “we cannot be sure the people you have spoken with were part of the development work that related to your article,” though he notably did not dispute the veracity of the global test agreement, which ultimately allows all test users’ data to be collected and used for machine learning.
- When we asked privacy lawyers and scholars to review the consent agreements and shared with them the test users’ concerns, they saw the documents and the privacy violations that ensued as emblematic of a broken consent framework that affects us all—whether we are beta testers or regular consumers.
- Experts say companies are well aware that people rarely read privacy policies closely, if we read them at all. But what iRobot’s global test agreement attests to, says Ben Winters, a lawyer with the Electronic Privacy Information Center who focuses on AI and human rights, is that “even if you do read it, you still don’t get clarity.”
- Rather, “a lot of this language seems to be designed to exempt the company from applicable privacy laws, but none of it reflects the reality of how the product operates,” says Cahn, pointing to the robot vacuums’ mobility and the impossibility of controlling where potentially sensitive people or objects—in particular children—are at all times in their own home.
- Ultimately, that “place[s] much of the responsibility … on the end user,” notes Jessica Vitak, an information scientist at the University of Maryland’s College of Information Studies who studies best practices in research and consent policies. Yet it doesn’t give them a true accounting of “how things might go wrong,” she says—“which would be very valuable information when deciding whether to participate.”
- Not only does it put the onus on the user; it also leaves it to that single person to “unilaterally affirm the consent of every person within the home,” explains Cahn, even though “everyone who lives in a house that uses one of these devices will potentially be put at risk.”
- All of this lets the company shirk its true responsibility as a data controller, adds Deirdre Mulligan, a professor in the School of Information at UC Berkeley. “A device manufacturer that is a data controller” can’t simply “offload all responsibility for the privacy implications of the device's presence in the home to an employee” or other volunteer data collectors.
- Some participants did admit that they hadn’t read the consent agreement closely. “I skimmed the [terms and conditions] but didn't notice the part about sharing *video and images* with a third party—that would’ve given me pause,” one tester, who used the vacuum for three months last year, wrote in an email.
- Before testing his Roomba, B said, he had “perused” the consent agreement and “figured it was a standard boilerplate: ‘We can do whatever the hell we want with what we collect, and if you don’t like that, don't participate [or] use our product.’” He added, “Admittedly, I just wanted a free product.”
- Still, B expected that iRobot would offer some level of data protection—not that the “company that made us swear up and down with NDAs that we wouldn't share any information” about the tests would “basically subcontract their most intimate work to the lowest bidder.”
- Notably, many of the test users who reached out—even those who say they did read the full global test agreement, as well as myriad other agreements, including ones applicable to all consumers—still say they lacked a clear understanding of what collecting their data actually meant or how exactly that data would be processed and used.
- What they did understand often depended more on their own awareness of how artificial intelligence is trained than on anything communicated by iRobot.
- One tester, Igor, who asked to be identified only by his first name, works in IT for a bank; he considers himself to have “above average training in cybersecurity” and has built his own internet infrastructure at home, allowing him to self-host sensitive information on his own servers and monitor network traffic. He said he did understand that videos would be taken from inside his home and that they would be tagged. “I felt that the company handled the disclosure of the data collection responsibly,” he wrote in an email, pointing to both the consent agreement and the device’s prominently placed sticker reading “video recording in process.” But, he emphasized, “I’m not an average internet user.”
- For many testers, the greatest shock from our story was how the data would be handled after collection—including just how much humans would be involved. “I assumed it [the video recording] was only for internal validation if there was an issue as is common practice (I thought),” another tester who asked to be anonymous wrote in an email. And as B put it, “It definitely crossed my mind that these photos would probably be viewed for tagging within a company, but the idea that they were leaked online is disconcerting.”
- “Human review didn't surprise me,” Greg adds, but “the level of human review did … the idea, generally, is that AI should be able to improve the system 80% of the way … and the remainder of it, I think, is just on the exception … that [humans] have to look at it.”
- Even the participants who were comfortable with having their images viewed and annotated, like Igor, said they were uncomfortable with how iRobot processed the data after the fact. The consent agreement, Igor wrote, “doesn’t excuse the poor data handling” and “the overall storage and control that allowed a contractor to export the data.”
- Multiple US-based participants, meanwhile, expressed concerns about their data being transferred out of the country. The global agreement, they noted, had language for participants “based outside of the US” saying that “iRobot may process Research Data on servers not in my home country … including those whose laws may not offer the same level of data protection as my home country”—but the agreement did not have any corresponding information for US-based participants on how their data would be processed.
- “I had no idea that the data was going overseas,” one US-based participant wrote to MIT Technology Review—a sentiment repeated by many.
- Once data is collected, whether from test users or from customers, people ultimately have little to no control over what the company does with it next—including, for US users, sharing their data overseas.
- US users, in fact, have few privacy protections even in their home country, notes Cahn, which is why the EU has laws to protect data from being transferred outside the EU—and to the US specifically. “Member states have to take such extensive steps to protect data being stored in that country. Whereas in the US, it’s largely the Wild West,” he says. “Americans have no equivalent protection against their data being stored in other countries.”
- For some testers, this compensation was disappointing—“even before considering … my naked ass could now be on the Internet.”
- Many testers themselves are aware of the broader issues around data protection in the US, which is why they chose to speak out.
- “Outside of regulated industries like banking and health care, the best thing we can probably do is create significant liability for data protection failure, as only hard economic incentives will make companies focus on this,” wrote Igor, the tester who works in IT at a bank. “Sadly the political climate doesn’t seem like anything could pass here in the US. The best we have is the public shaming … but that is often only reactionary and catches just a small percentage of what’s out there.”
- In the meantime, in the absence of change and accountability—whether from iRobot itself or pushed by regulators—Greg has a message for potential Roomba buyers. “I just wouldn’t buy one, flat out,” he says, because he feels “iRobot is not handling their data security model well.”
- And on top of that, he warns, they’re “really dismissing their responsibility as vendors to … notify [or] protect customers—which in this case include the testers of these products.”

- A total of 15 screenshots from sensitive video recordings captured by robot cleaners used by testers appeared on private Facebook and Discord groups
- Roomba robot vacuum cleaner maker iRobot said the sharing of images on social media recorded by special test versions of its devices was in violation of its agreements
- ntimate images captured by robot vacuum cleaners during testing were shared on social media, according to a report. The sensitive photos included several images of a woman seated on the toilet with her shorts pulled down to her thighs. Another shows a child lying on the floor with his face clearly visible.
- The pictures were among 15 screenshots taken from recordings made by special development versions of Roomba J7 series robot vacuum cleaners in 2020, which were obtained by MIT Technology Review. These images were reportedly shared on private groups on Facebook and chat app Discord by gig workers in countries such as Venezuela, whose job it is to label audio, photo and video data used to train artificial intelligence (AI).
- Roomba maker iRobot – which Amazon is in the process of acquiring – said the recordings originated from robots with hardware and software tweaks that aren’t sold to the public. These devices are given to testers and staff who must explicitly agree to share their data, including video recordings, with iRobot.
- The images are intended to be used to improve the robots’ artificial intelligence
- However, the incident demonstrates the cracks in a system in which troves of data are exchanged between tech manufacturers and the firms that help to improve their AI algorithms. This info, including pics and videos, can sometimes end up in the hands of low-cost contracted workers employed in far-flung destinations around the world. These workers handle everything from keeping harmful posts off social media to transcribing audio recordings designed to enhance voice assistants.
- SPONSORED
- In iRobot’s case, the company works with Scale AI, a startup based in San Francisco that relies on gig workers to review and tag audio, photo and video data used to train artificial intelligence. iRobot has previously said that it has shared over 2 million images with Scale AI, and an unknown quantity with other data annotation platforms.
- Both iRobot and Scale AI said the sharing of screenshots on social media violated their agreements. The images in question included a mix of personal photos and everyday pics from inside homes, including furniture, decor and objects located on walls and ceilings. They also contained descriptive labels like “tv”, “plant_or_flower” and “ceiling light”.
- Labellers had discussed the images in Facebook, Discord and other online groups that they had created to share advice on handling payments and labeling tricky objects, according to MIT Technology Review. iRobot told the publication that the images came from its devices in countries including France, Germany, Spain, the US and Japan.
- This process of recording and labelling images is used to improve a robot vacuum cleaner’s computer vision, which allows the devices to accurately map their surroundings using high-definition cameras and an array of laser-based sensors. The tech helps them determine the size of a room, avoid obstacles like furniture and cables, and adjust its cleaning regimen.
- Computer vision is limited to only the most high-end robots on the market, including the Roomba J7, a device that currently costs £459.
- iRobot said that it collects the vast majority of its image data sets from real homes occupied by either its employees or volunteers recruited by third-parties, with the latter offered incentives for participation. The rest of the training data comes from “staged data collection” that the company uses to build models it then records. Its consumer devices capture mapping and navigation information and share some usage data on functionality to the cloud, although this does not include images, according to the company’s support page.
- iRobot said that it had terminated its relationship with the “service provider who leaked the images” and is actively investigating the matter, and “taking measures to help prevent a similar leak by any service provider in the future”.

- Roomba robot vacuums captured sensitive pictures that were later leaked on social media — including one of a woman sitting on the toilet — but the maker of the machines says they were taken by test models, not consumer units, MIT Tech Review first reported.
- iRobot, which makes Roomba, said the self-driving vacuums were used by "paid data collectors and employees" as test units that would help the company develop its machine-learning capabilities. The disclosure comes as Amazon is working to close a $1.7 billion agreement to buy iRobot, raising questions about how tech companies use and protect the data they hoover up.
- Data from these test units was marked by a contractor — noting things like whether the robot successfully made its way around an obstacle, like a coffee table. But images from that data got leaked to Facebook, Discord and other social sites, MIT Tech Review reported and iRobot confirmed to Insider.
- The images included woman in a purple shirt, face blurred, sitting on the toilet, the Tech Review reported, and a child laying on his stomach as he stares at the object recording him.
- The images were leaked by paid Venezuelan contractors at data startup Scale AI who posted them to private groups on Facebook, Discord, and other platforms in 2020, MIT Tech Review reported.
- Even though the images did not come from Roomba customers, consumers often opt into getting their data monitored once they purchase "smart" devices as part of company privacy policies. Smart-device makers sometimes analyze the data, which can sometimes include personal or sensitive details, to train algorithms to improve their products.
- James Baussmann, an iRobot spokesperson, confirmed the photo leak to Insider. When asked for further comment, Baussman referred Insider to a blog post from iRobot chairman and CEO Colin Angle.
- Angle wrote that the test robots contained hardware and software modifications that were never available on the market to consumers. And Baussmann told Insider that "iRobot has strict data processing agreements in place with our service providers that require sensitive data be treated as confidential information."
- In this case, the Scale AI contractors — also known as data labelers — worked on a project for iRobot to tag photos so the robot vacuums could better recognize objects in their surroundings, according to MIT Tech Review.
- The data labelers are low-paid contract workers outside of the US. Experts who have spoken to labelers told MIT Tech Review that they found the work "really uncomfortable."
- iRobot told Insider that sharing internal images to social media groups violate Scale AI's privacy agreements and that it is ending its relationship with San Francisco-based Scale AI. Scale AI told the Review that its data labelers who shared the images broke their own agreements. Insider reached out to Scale AI for additional comment.
- Meanwhile, more than 95% of iRobot's image data set comes from the homes of iRobot employees or volunteers at other third-party data vendors who agree to use development devices in exchange for undisclosed rewards, according to the Review.
- Advanced devices such as iRobot's Roomba J7 series drive around homes and contain built-in front-facing cameras for navigation, object recognition, and home monitoring.

- Your robot vacuums are watching you — and the resulting imagery of your most private moments can, horrifically, get leaked online.
- As the MIT Technology Review reports, the aptly-named company iRobot, behind the uber-popular Roomba vacuums, confirmed that gig workers outside of the US broke a non-disclosure agreement when sharing intimate photos, including one of a woman on the toilet, to social media.
- As the report warns, however, those few images posted privately to contract worker shop talk groups may just be the tip of the privacy iceberg when it comes to robot vacuums and other smart home products that collect a ton of invasive data.
- The images in question, some of which MIT Tech shared — though thankfully not the bathroom one — were snapped by the vacuums for the purpose of data annotation, the process in which humans confirm or deny whether AI has accurately labeled things correctly. For Roombas, data annotation is a necessary part of the vacuums' efficiency — these human gig workers, most of whom live abroad, tell the robots' large AI database whether the thing in front of it is indeed a chair or if it's, say, a dog.
- While the data annotation process is integral to Roomba-style vacuums and other AI-enabled robotics, most people are unaware of the process, though iRobot claimed in its responses to MIT Tech that the leaked images came from development robots that had a bright green label that said "video recording in process."
- Still, the fact remains not only that these machines we bring into our homes are recording us, but also that there are humans out there who see the images and videos they capture — a creepy concept even for those who shrug over consumer privacy concerns.

- Featured Image Credit: iRobot’s Roomba J7
- Robot vacuum cleaner maker iRobot has confirmed that personal images of a woman which ended up being shared on Facebook were taken by one of their Roombas.
- Images of the woman, who was on the toilet at the time the photos were taken of her by a Roomba, came from one of their test units, not a purchased device, the company have said.
- MIT Technology Review says iRobot were using some Roombas as test units to collect information for 'paid data collectors and employees' to help the company work on their machine-learning.

- The pictures were taken by a Roomba J7 in 2020 and sent to Scale AI, a company which labels sounds and images in data to train artificial intelligence to better recognise what it is looking at.
- They include pictures of household interiors, some of them with people and their pets in the frame of the pictures taken by the Roomba.
- However, they say that one of the images which they obtained was of a woman on the toilet and the picture had then been posted to closed social media groups by employees meant to look through the data.
- Incidents such as these have caused concern over how personal data can be passed along without the knowledge of the subject, to the point that it can result in images of a person being shared on social media.
- In this instance a woman was filmed in a private moment during testing of a Roomba and images from that footage were ultimately shared in closed groups on social media.
- iRobot says their retail models are designed to immediately delete any image which contains a picture of a person, and that other images are stored in the cloud for 30 days before being deleted.
- They say these pictures can only be accessed by users via an app, and that iRobot cannot access images taken by Roombas sold to the public.
- iRobot told us that the Roombas involved in this situation were all research and development devices, not ones which the general public could buy off the shelves.
- These robots contain modifications which allow them to collect data, these modifications are not included on Roombas available for purchase by the public, they were also labelled with green stickers saying 'video recording in progress'.
- iRobot CEO Colin Angle released a statement on the matter saying their products ensured 'best in class product security and consumer privacy'.
- He said: "The iRobot-related images in question were from development robots used by paid data collectors and employees in 2020 for machine learning purposes.
- "The images are not from production robots in consumers' homes."
- "iRobot is terminating its relationship with the service provider who leaked the images, is actively investigating the matter, and taking measures to help prevent a similar leak by any service provider in the future."
- UNILAD has contacted Scale AI for comment.

- Some people feel uncomfortable getting dressed or using the bathroom in front of their pet dog. But most of us don't give a second thought to what we do in front of the little robo-butler zipping around our homes.
- But a recent investigation might change all that. MIT Technology Review's Eileen Guoarchive wrote a story that might have you commanding your Roomba to knock before it comes into your room.
- In 2020, an image of a woman sitting on a toilet, as well as several others capturing intimate moments, that were collected by Roombas found their way into closed social media groups.

- Now, there is an explanation for how this happened, which is simultaneously relieving and upsetting.
- iRobot confirmed to MIT Technology Review that the images were, in fact, captured by Roombas. But it wasn't a hack or anything nefarious. It was part of a program to develop their high-end Roomba J7's AI capabilities. iRobot broke down the details in a statement, highlighted here:
- But how, exactly, did the photos get posted on social media?
- The images and video were sent by iRobot to a startup called Scale AI, which uses a global workforce to label audio, photo, and video for a process called data annotation. An investigation revealed that Venezuelan gig workers posted the toilet bowl pic and other images to private groups on Facebook, Discord, and other platforms to collaborate on their work.

- After MIT Technology contacted iRobot about this incident, they received an email from iRobot CEO Colin Angle, stating: "iRobot is terminating its relationship with the service provider who leaked the images, is actively investigating the matter, and [is] taking measures to help prevent a similar leak by any service provider in the future."
- Feel better about that little motorized guy who just swept up your Cheetos crumbs? Didn't think so. Our advice? Keep your bathroom door closed when you are using it. And, honestly, that goes for whether you have a Roomba or not.

- Twenty years after the introduction of the very first Roomba, robot vacuums have moved on from being a niche luxury to being relatively common. And its creator, iRobot, is not done adding capabilities.
- The latest version expands on the robot vacuum toolset with a few new impressive tricks and smarts, but also widens the kinds of data your automated friend may scoop up alongside the dust and dirt as it moves around your home. Which is sure to be of particular concern to privacy advocates, as iRobot may soon be acquired by renowned information hoarder Amazon.
- The Roomba Combo J7+ vacuums and mops, with its mop pad able to be stored on top of the unit when not needed.
- At $2200 the Roomba Combo J7+ is a big investment as far as robot cleaners go, but it also pulls out all the stops. It has a retractable mop pad so it can automatically transition from vacuuming and mopping on hard floors to only vacuuming on carpets, removing the need for human intervention and ensuring your carpets stay dry. It returns to its “clean base” of its own initiative to charge, and to eject dirt into a bag so you hardly ever have to empty anything out into the bin manually. And it maintains a map of your floor that you can mark up with room names, no-go zones and extra dirty places that need special attention, for a customised clean.
- All this stuff together makes for a pretty comprehensive robo-vac. You can of course just press its button and let it clean the whole floor, like you’ve always been able to with Roombas. But you can also create lists of specific cleaning jobs using the app, and activate them with a button, on a schedule or with a spoken word to Alexa or Google. So you could set it to clean under the kitchen table at 8pm every night, while you’re putting the kids to bed. Or if you happen to dump half a box of Rice Bubbles on the floor — to take a random example — you can call out and have the robot just vac that specific spot.
- The Roomba wants to know if these speakers and cables will always be hidden here.
- If you allow the app to monitor your location, you can even have the robot do its daily cleaning only when you’re out of the house, putting itself away when you’re home, so it seems like you just magically have clean floors.
- In practice there are of course some hiccups. You still need to declutter the floor before the vacuum does its thing, because it’s better but not perfect at avoiding debris it’s not expecting to be there. It also does not have a way of replenishing its own water supply for the mop, so if you don’t remember to fill it you might get halfway to the shops and then get a notification on your phone pleading for a top-up.
- And speaking of notifications, the Combo has a camera and a light on the front that it uses to detect objects it might need to avoid, but it also uses it to send you photos of stuff it’s not sure about.
- That’s pretty weird for a robot vacuum (and it’s also a bit confronting to see what the deep underneath of my entertainment centre looks like), but by giving feedback on these pictures you can help it learn new kinds of temporary obstacles it might find around your home, or identify places it just shouldn’t try to go.
- If an automated and Wi-Fi connected robot covered in cameras and sensors roaming your house and taking photos sounds scary to you, you’re probably not alone. But then iRobot’s always had excellent privacy credentials compared to other makers of smart home gear. It doesn’t sell your data, doesn’t send anything to iRobot without your express consent, all the tracking and mapping features are easy to turn off, and there’s a quick option to purge any information your bots have collected.
- The ‘clean base’ serves as a charger and a way for the robot to transfer collected dirt to a bag.
- The new robots with cameras seem to be doing things the right way as well; all images are encrypted at all times and only you can view them, unless you specifically opt to share them with iRobot via the app. The robots also get rid of any images with people in them immediately. Or you can turn its ability to capture and send you images off entirely.
- Earlier this year Amazon signalled its intention to buy iRobot for $US1.7 billion ($2.5 billion), in a deal that’s currently being scrutinised by US regulators.
- It remains to be seen how the data collection and privacy policies at the company would change over time assuming the transaction goes through, but the worst case scenario is obviously that Amazon would somehow use data collected by its robots to draw insights into your home life in order to sell you things.
- But Barry Schliesmann, iRobot senior vice president, said the company’s commitment to transparency and security isn’t going anywhere.
- “Our customers invite us into their most personal spaces — their homes — because they trust that our products will help them do more. iRobot takes that trust seriously,” he said.
- “As such, security and privacy features are built into our products from the beginning of the development process. iRobot has also taken substantial measures to enhance security and privacy to ensure the company meets and exceeds regulatory requirements. None of this changes as a result of Amazon’s planned acquisition of iRobot.”
