- An AI system in the Chinese city of Ningbo has mistakenly accused a woman pictured on the side of a bus of jaywalking.
- The system had reacted to an advert on the side of a bus that showed the face of Dong Mingzhu, CEO of Gree Electric Appliances, China's biggest air-conditioner maker.
- Ms Dong's face had subsequently been shown on a large display on a roadside in an effort to shame her. Meantime, the real jaywalker walked free.
- Ningbo police said they had deleted the photo of Ms Mong and would update the AI system so that it could differentiate between ads and people.

- Cities across China have debuted crime-fighting facial recognition technology to much fanfare over the past year. But some of these jaywalker-busting devices aren’t as impressive as they seem.
- A facial recognition system in the city of Ningbo caught Dong Mingzhu, the chair of appliance-making giant Gree Electric, running a red light. Only it turned out not to be Dong, but rather an advertisement featuring her face on the side of a bus, local police said on Weibo Wednesday.
- The police said they have upgraded their tech to avoid issues like this in the future. The real Dong, meanwhile, is embroiled in drama with an electric vehicle company.

- If you're caught jaywalking in China, your photo could be put on display as punishment. Just like a woman whose face was on a bus ad when it went by the camera. Police are fixing the technology.
- DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Good morning. I'm David Greene. If you are jaywalking in China, you might be caught on camera, and your face could be plastered on a huge screen. According to the South China Morning Post, police in the city of Ningbo have been doing this to crack down on jaywalking. It happened to Dong Mingzhu - only she didn't jaywalk. Her face just went by the cameras on a bus. It was an ad for the appliance company she runs. The police say they're fixing this technology so it just targets actual people. It's MORNING EDITION.

- Over-zealous AI systems in China have accused a woman pictured on the side of a bus of jaywalking.
- The face of Dong Mingzhu, who heads China's biggest air-conditioner maker, was briefly shown on a billboard used to shame those who flout traffic laws.
- But the AI-based spotting system in Ningbo had reacted to the bus advert rather than Ms Dong herself.
- Police said they had deleted the photo and would update the jaywalker-spotting system to avoid similar mistakes.
- Traffic police in many Chinese cities have started using a variety of methods to stop people crossing streets unlawfully.
- Many now rely on automatic camera-based systems that take pictures of people as they cross roads or mingle with traffic.
- The images and names of jaywalkers are featured on large displays and warn people about the legal consequences of their actions.
- Police in Ningbo said its public shaming of Ms Dong was a mistake as the AI system had spotted her face in an advert for Gree Electric Appliances - the business she runs.
- Local police acknowledged the mistake in a Sina Weibo blog and said the snap of Ms Dong had been deleted, reported the South China Morning Post.
- Work was now taking place to ensure the AI-system could differentiate between ads and people, it added.
- Gree Electric reacted by thanking the police for their hard work, the paper said.

- There are many criticisms you can level at China's growing reliance on facial recognition, including its absolute faith in technology: what happens if there's a false positive?  Unfortunately, we just saw an example of that in action.  Police in the city of Ningbo have taken corrective action after the facial recognition system at a crosswalk mistakenly accused famous businesswoman Dong Mingzhu of jaywalking because she appeared in an ad on a passing bus.  As with any other detected offender in the area, it posted both Dong's name (incorrectly displaying her surname as "Ju") and government ID.
- The police have since deleted the infraction and claim they've upgraded the facial recognition technology to "reduce the false recognition rate," although it's unclear just what they could have done to address this specific issue.
- While commentators joked about the case of mistaken identity, it illustrates just what can go wrong with facial recognition technology even if you tolerate constant public surveillance.  If there's a false hit, it can tarnish an innocent person's record -- and not everyone has the luxury of bus ads or an easily recognizable face to help clear their name.

- Facepalm: China is well known for embracing facial recognition tech to catch lawbreakers, but these systems don't always get it right. Earlier this week, one camera captured the image of a famous businesswoman and publicly shamed her, but she wasn't even there at the time.
- As reported by Abacus, a camera at an intersection in the eastern city of Ningbo, located in east China's Zhejiang province, filmed what was assumed to be a jaywalker. The facial recognition tech identified her as Dong Mingzhu, a famous businesswoman, who, as noted by The Verge, topped Forbes' 100 outstanding businesswomen in China list last year.
- But it turned out that Dong wasn't even present. The camera had seen her face on the side of a bus advertisement for Gree Electric and mistakenly thought she was crossing during a red light.
- Whenever the system identifies jaywalkers, it posts their photo onto a large public screen to 'name and shame' the perpetrators. It showed Dong's face and name, though it incorrectly spelled her surname as "Ju," along with her government ID. There was also text that said she had broken the law.
- Ningbo's traffic police wrote on Chinese microblogging site Weibo that the system had made a mistake and all record of the violation was being deleted. They also claimed that an upgrade had been carried out to reduce the chances of such an error happening again.
- We've heard reports of China using facial recognition in several ways, from analyzing students' emotions in schools to scanning for suspects via special glasses. Back in April, the system reportedly identified a suspected criminal from a crowd of 50,000 people, which sounds impressive, but in a country with a poor reputation when it comes to privacy and human rights, and the prospect of more false positives, such technology is a concern.

- So the system picked up her face on the bus ad and reported her as jaywalking.
- Whenever the system identifies jaywalkers, it posts their photo onto a large public screen to ‘name and shame’ the perpetrators. It showed Dong’s face and name, though it incorrectly spelled her surname as “Ju,” along with her government ID. There was also text that said she had broken the law.

- By  Shannon Liao
- China’s facial recognition systems are used to catch all types of criminals, from thieves to jaywalkers, in real time. This week, one facial recognition camera publicly shamed a famous business woman for jaywalking after its systems caught her face crossing an intersection. The problem? She was never physically there.
- As first reported by Abacus, it all took place in the Zhejiang province, south of Shanghai. The face of Dong Mingzhu, a president of China’s top air-conditioning company, flashed on a large screen displayed to the public listing nearby jaywalkers caught by cameras. A line of text captioned her photo, saying she had broken the law. It also listed part of her government ID number and her name, but misidentified her surname as “Ju.”
- But what the camera actually saw was an ad featuring Dong’s face on the side of a bus. Local police soon admitted in a statement on microblogging site Weibo that identifying Dong as a jaywalker was an error made by the facial recognition system, and claimed that the problem had now been fixed by an upgrade.
- Dong Mingzhu made first place on the Forbes list of the top 100 outstanding businesswomen in China last year and has made headlines for having never taken a day off in 26 years, at the cost of her personal life. A photo of the display screen has gone viral on Weibo, as people pointed out that despite the hype surrounding facial recognition, it turned out the system could still make mistakes. “Be careful of being sued by Dong Mingzhu,” one netizen mocked.
- Chinese traffic police have increasingly relied on facial recognition systems to catch those who violate the rules. The systems have come to major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, and have captured tens of thousands of jaywalkers since installation. Officials have also talked to WeChat and Weibo about potentially fining offenders via text messages. While the systems are often a talking point for officials discussing their accomplishments and work to bring down crime, but as this incident proves, the systems still aren’t infallible.
