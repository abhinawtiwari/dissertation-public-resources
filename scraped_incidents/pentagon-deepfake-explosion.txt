- A deepfake photograph and accompanying report of an explosion near to the Pentagon outside Washington DC led to a 0.26% fall in the US stock market in four minutes. The report was quickly rebutted as false by Arlington authorities.
- A verified Twitter account called @BloombergFeed impersonating a Bloomberg profile had shared a photo of plumes of smoke billowing over a large white building with the words 'Large explosion near The Pentagon Complex in Washington D.C - Initial Report'.
- As noted by the Insider, the photograph featured 'some of the hallmarks of AI-generated images'. The columns on the supposed building in the hoax photo varied in size and the fence appeared to blend into the sidewalk in some places.
- The photograph and report, which have since been deleted, had quickly gone viral on Twitter and were retweeted by high-profile Twitter Russian news account @RT and @DeItaone.

- A fake image of an explosion near the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., may have been created by artificial-intelligence tools.
- But that didn't stop it from being spread by dozens of accounts on social media — and the stock market briefly dipped as the fake news spread.
- An image appearing to show a massive cloud of smoke near a building and claims that there had been an explosion near the Pentagon started circulating on Twitter early Monday.
- But the image and associated claims were fake, the Arlington Police Department said.
- "There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public," the Arlington PD tweeted Monday.
- While it hasn't been confirmed whether the image was made using AI tools, it does feature some of the hallmarks of AI-generated images. The columns on the supposed building in the hoax photo vary in size, for example, and the fence appears to blend into the sidewalk in some places.
- The photo was spread by dozens of accounts on social media, including RT, a Russian state-media Twitter account with more than 3 million followers — but the post has since been deleted. Most other accounts that retweeted the image appear to be affiliated with conspiracies or the war in Ukraine.
- Information about the purported explosion was shared by the Twitter account @DeItaone at 10:06 a.m. ET. By 10:10, the market had fallen 0.26% but quickly bounced back.
- DeItaone later posted that news of the explosion was fake.

- An aerial view of The Pentagon on May 10, 2023. Images that purported to show smoke rising from the headquarters of the U.S. armed forces appear to have been generated by artificial intelligence tools.
- A false report of an explosion at the Pentagon, accompanied by an apparently AI-generated image, spread on Twitter on Monday morning, sparking a brief dip in the stock market.
- "There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public," the Department of Defense's Pentagon Force Protection Agency and the Arlington County fire department said in a joint statement on Twitter.
- The fake image circulating on Twitter showed a black cloud of smoke near a building. The accounts posting it claimed it depicted the Pentagon.
- But the image was likely generated by artificial intelligence, experts said, in an example of potential for misuse of the increasingly popular and prevalent technology that they have been worried about.
- "Check out the frontage of the building, and the way the fence melds into the crowd barriers. There's also no other images, videos or people posting as first hand witnesses," Nick Waters of the open-source investigations group Bellingcat wrote on Twitter.

- Soon, other apparently fake AI images purporting to show an explosion at the White House popped up.
- Major stock market indices briefly dipped on the false reports before recovering.
- Many of the Twitter accounts that spread the hoax carried blue checks, which used to signify that the social network had verified the account is who or what it claims to be. But under new owner Elon Musk, the company now gives a blue check to any account that pays for a monthly Twitter Blue subscription.
- Among the blue-check accounts that shared the false Pentagon image were an one impersonating Bloomberg News and the real account of the Kremlin-linked Russian news service RT.
- RT later deleted its post. The fake Bloomberg account has been suspended by Twitter.
- Twitter responded to a request for comment with an auto-reply containing a poop emoji.

- Opinion
- A fake image of an explosion at the Pentagon seems to have proven the ability of cheap AI apps to move global financial markets, and nobody seems to know what to do about it.
- When you report on the cut and thrust of breakneck developments, big money deals, mind-bending hype, and multi-billionaire egos in the technology world, it can be easy to get caught up in the game and ignore the fact that the winners are not always the good guys.
- Take your pick of fun, child-focused movies. The Mitchells vs. the Machines, Ron’s Gone Wrong, Big Hero 6, even Pixar’s WALL-E 15 years ago, and it is a common theme. Big tech bros invent AI-based cool developments which humanity goes mad for, before learning that things were way better without them, and an unlikely hero saves the day with derring-do.
- A fake image of an explosion, supposedly at the Pentagon, seems to have proven the ability of cheap AI apps to move global financial markets.
- But parents know there is no final act miracle in the non-animated world. And investors learnt about the dangers of AI this week after financial markets were briefly wobbled by what they thought was an explosion at the Pentagon in the US.
- A verified Twitter account (thanks Elon) purporting to be related to the well-respected Bloomberg news empire, shared a photo of plumes of smoke billowing over a large white building with the words, “Large explosion near The Pentagon Complex in Washington D.C - Initial Report”.
- The image and Twitter account was fake. The image was likely generated by an artificial intelligence app, but it was not debunked until after the Dow Jones Industrial Index dropped 85 points (0.3 per cent) in four minutes.
- It is arguable that the images had no impact on that, of course, but that would seem foolhardy ignorance given the fake Bloomberg tweet had been circulated by accounts with large followings, such as Russia Today, the country’s national broadcaster.
- Smart fakery is a pending problem that has vexed the minds of academics and technologists for years, but is rapidly becoming a real-world dilemma in the era of generative AI.
- The potential for markets to be manipulated, societal unrest to be fomented, and individuals to be targeted by all kinds of horrible online hoaxes has arrived, and we are nowhere near prepared to deal with it.
- Back in 2004 (yes, I was a child prodigy, honest), I interviewed an expert from US research firm Gartner called Daryl Plummer about a concept he was already warning about called “counterfeit reality”, whereby technology that was then being used to create convincing virtual worlds in movies, would be used to cause real-world havoc.
- At the time there were already examples that had occurred. The previous year Piers Morgan had been forced to resign as editor of The Daily Mirror after splashing fake photographs of British soldiers torturing an Iraqi prisoner on its front page.
- Meanwhile, photographs of Democrat Presidential candidate John Kerry speaking alongside Jane Fonda at an anti-Vietnam rally in 1970 appeared in the run-up to his tilt at the US presidential election.
- Veterans called the image a “slap in the face” and, despite being proved fake, it succeeded in portraying Kerry as an anti-military service candidate, ahead of his very narrow loss to George W. Bush.
- “Fake reality for sale will be the norm in the next decade and its growth will not be about technology, but society’s propensity for allowing the deviant to become the norm,” Plummer told me in 2004.
- “As people come to expect the use of virtual technology instead of real-time human interaction, the psychological outrage expected with counterfeit reality will be diminished ... I suspect there will be some very notable situations where we are fooled and a lot of noise will happen. The existing examples are just the tip of the iceberg.”
- While he got his timings wrong, we are now in the counterfeit reality era, whether we believe it or not.
- Voice cloning technology is advanced enough to generate unique speech that sounds like the intended person, from just a few short samples of their genuine audio, and the ability to align this with faked video will weaponise it.
- In the newsroom of a financial newspaper we will have to be more diligent than ever in vetting anonymous tips that come in. Leaked audio of the CEOs of Qantas and Virgin discussing a merger may sound like a huge scoop, but what if it is just a shareholder with an AI app trying to pump up the shares?
- The conundrums for other industries will also be obvious to the people working within them.
- Voice cloning currently has limitations in that it works far more effectively in a short burst of audio, and falls short of being convincing in a live scenario where a human may seek to interrogate it, but that is still a pretty big scope for skulduggery.
- Earlier this year AI speech start-up ElevenLabs had to issue new terms and conditions after “an increasing number of misuse cases” emerged when it opened access to its voice-cloning platform.
- Fake speeches by US President Joe Biden spread like wildfire, and it is all funny and good fun ... until it isn’t, of course. (Bad language warning for the end of the video in this tweet.)
- Executive impersonation is something cybersecurity firms are already trying to sell related services to mitigate against to businesses, but there is an existential problem looming in financial markets, and society more broadly.
- Is it the market operators responsibility to put shares in a halt because a tweet is going viral? What does Commonwealth Bank do when a video of Matt Comyn’s resignation speech goes up online, when he is really just on holiday in Byron Bay?
- I certainly have no idea, but the worrying thing is, I suspect they don’t either.

- A deepfake of an explosion at the Pentagon that caused the stock market to dip exemplified the misinformation risks of generative AI.
- On Monday, a seemingly AI-generated image of what looked like an explosion outside of the Pentagon circulated on Twitter. The Arlington Police Department quickly debunked the image tweeting, "There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public."
- But not before the stock market dipped by 0.26 percent before bouncing back, according to Insider(opens in a new tab).
- It's unclear how the image was created, but it has the telltale signs of an AI-generated image. The fencing in front of the building is blurred and the columns appear to be different widths. Any social media sleuth accustomed to spotting photoshopped images of celebrities and influencers would have noticed this, but as generative AI continues to improve, deepfakes will be harder to spot.
- Even with Arlington PD's quick response, Twitter's mess of a verification system compounded the issue. One of the accounts that tweeted the image was a verified account impersonating a Bloomberg news feed. That account, called @BloombergFeed, has since been suspended.
- Other accounts that tweeted the image were @DeItaone and the account Russian state-media owned site RT. Now that anyone can pay to become verified on Twitter, situations like this are the perfect storm of misinformation.
- A fake Twitter account shares a fake image that leads to real consequences. Welcome to 2023.

- A purportedly AI-generated photo of a fake explosion at the Pentagon spread rapidly on social media on Monday – prompting mass confusion among users and a brief selloff in the US stock market.
- The fake photo, which showed smoke billowing outside the Pentagon, was shared by Russian state media outlet and other accounts alongside claims that an explosion has occurred at the complex. RT later deleted the image.
- The Arlington County Fire Department quickly tweeted a message debunking the hoax photo.
- “@PFPAOfficial and the ACFD are aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon,” the tweet said. “There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.”
- The Post has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment.

- US stocks appeared to briefly dip as the photo circulated, but quickly rebounded after the picture was exposed as a hoax.
- The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 50 points as of noon ET, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the broad-based S&P 500 were both trading slightly higher.
- Some users pointed out that the fake Pentagon photo showed clear signs of AI manipulation, including warped sections of fence.

- The social media scare will add fuel to concerns among critics who say that advanced AI systems will allow bad actors around the world to spread misinformation and sow chaos online.
- Previously, social media users were tricked by viral AI-generated images of Pope Francis wearing a Balenciaga puffer jacket and of former President Donald Trump clashing with the NYPD while being arrested.
- This morning, an AI generated image of an explosion at the US Pentagon surfaced.With multiple news sources reporting it as real, the S&P 500 fell 30 points in minutes.This resulted in a $500 billion market cap swing on a fake image.It then rebounded once the image was… pic.twitter.com/DpHgflkMXP
- In March, Elon Musk and more than 1,000 experts cited the spread of misinformation as a key motivation in their call for a six-month pause on the development of advanced AI until proper safety guidelines were in place.
- The experts cited risks including the spread of “propaganda and untruth,” job losses, the development of “nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us,” and the risk of “loss of control of our civilization.”
- Dr. Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “Godfather of AI,” grew so concerned by the technology’s potential risks that he quit his job at Google last month so that he could speak out without hurting his former employer.
- Hinton warned that AI will become more dangerous in the future — with “bad actors” potentially exploiting advanced systems “for bad things” that will be hard to prevent.

- A fake image purporting to show an explosion near the Pentagon was shared by multiple verified Twitter accounts on Monday, causing confusion and leading to a brief dip in the stock market. Local officials later confirmed no such incident had occurred.
- The image, which bears all the hallmarks of being generated by artificial intelligence, was shared by numerous verified accounts with blue check marks, including one that falsely claimed it was associated with Bloomberg News.
- “Large explosion near the Pentagon complex in Washington DC. – initial report,” the account posted, along with an image purporting to show black smoke rising near a large building.
- The account has since been suspended by Twitter. It was unclear who was behind the account or where the image originated. A spokesperson for Bloomberg News said the account is not affiliated with the news organization.
- Under owner Elon Musk, Twitter has allowed anyone to obtain a verified account in exchange for a monthly payment. As a result, Twitter verification is no longer an indicator that an account represents who it claims to represent.
- Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.
- The false reports of the explosion also made their way to air on a major Indian television network. Republic TV reported that an explosion had taken place, showing the fake image on its air and citing reports from the Russian news outlet RT. It later retracted the report when it became clear the incident had not taken place.
- “Republic had aired news of a possible explosion near the Pentagon citing a post & picture tweeted by RT,” the outlet later posted on its Twitter account. “RT has deleted the post and Republic has pulled back the newsbreak.”
- In a statement Tuesday, the RT press office said, “As with fast-paced news verification, we made the public aware of reports circulating and once provenance and veracity were ascertained, we took appropriate steps to correct the reporting.”
- In a post on the Russian social media platform VKontakte Tuesday, RT tried to make light of its apparent error.
- “Is the Pentagon on fire? Look, there’s a picture and everything. It’s not real, it’s just an AI generated image. Still, this picture managed to fool several major news outlets full of clever and attractive people, allegedly,” a post from RT read.
- In the moments after the image began circulating on Twitter, the US stock market took a noticeable dip. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 80 points between 10:06 a.m. and 10:10 a.m., fully recovering by 10:13 a.m. Similarly, the broader S&P 500 went from up 0.02% at 10:06 a.m. to down 0.15% at 10:09 a.m.. By 10:11 a.m., the index was positive again.
- The building in the image does not closely resemble the Pentagon and, according to experts, shows signs it may have been created using AI.
- “This image shows typical signs of being AI-synthesized: there are structural mistakes on the building and fence that you would not see if, for example, someone added smoke to an existing photo,” Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and digital forensic expert told CNN.
- The fire department in Arlington, Virginia, later responded in a tweet, stating that it and the Pentagon Force Protection Agency were “aware of a social media report circulating online about an explosion near the Pentagon. There is NO explosion or incident taking place at or near the Pentagon reservation, and there is no immediate danger or hazards to the public.”
