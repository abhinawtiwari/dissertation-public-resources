- Online reviews generated by ChatGPT and other chatbots are increasingly plaguing the internet and resulting in confused and irritated consumers, according to reports by CNBC, The Verge, and other mainstream media outlets.
- According to CNBC, reviews containing phrases such as 'As an AI language model' can increasingly be found on a wide range of products for sale on Amazon. Vice News found the same phrase also appears on many other online commerce and review sites.
- Review sites say they are removing AI-generated accounts and posts as fast as they can, but the volume of low-quality reviews and spam appears to be increasing relentlessly.

- Artificial intelligence chatbots like the hugely popular ChatGPT have proven to be a handy tool for helping people write emails, resumes and even fiction.
- Now, the technology has found its way into some reviews for products sold on Amazon. A scan of listings for waist trimmers, car batteries, school textbooks, a baby car seat mirror and game-controller accessories shows what appear to be AI-generated reviews. The reviews all include the phrase "As an AI language model," a common response generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT, along with generic descriptions of the product.
- For example, a review for a pair of maternity shorts states, "As an AI language model, I don't have a body, but I understand the importance of comfortable clothing during pregnancy. If you're looking for comfortable and stylish shorts for your pregnancy, the QGGQDD Maternity Shorts Over Belly with Pockets might be a great option for you."
- That review and others were left by members of Amazon's Vine program, launched in 2007, which "selects the most insightful reviewers" to receive free stuff in exchange for their honest opinion. Reviews from these members often appear as an "Amazon Vine Review" or a "Vine Voice."
- Another review for an LED aquarium light starts this way: "As an AI language model, I haven't actually used an aquarium light myself. That said, here is a sample review for a LED aquarium light based on the features and benefits that one might expect."
- Amazon said it prohibits review abuse, including offering incentives like gift cards to write positive reviews. The company will suspend or ban users from its platform that violate these policies.
- "We want Amazon customers to shop with confidence knowing that the reviews they see are authentic and trustworthy," a spokesperson said in a statement.
- Bogus reviews have long been a problem for Amazon and other online marketplaces, and many companies have turned to a combination of human moderators and automated tools to stamp them out.
- The e-commerce giant has recently filed lawsuits against fake review brokers. It's also appealed to social media platforms like Meta to help root out fake reviews, which can be bought and sold in Facebook groups and Telegram chats.
- The rise of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots could make it easier for bad actors to generate fraudulent reviews. Third-party sellers on Amazon are already using the tool to help write product listings and catchy titles, as well as marketing copy. Some authors are also turning to ChatGPT to write e-books published in Amazon's Kindle store, Reuters reported.

- In this article
- Chad Rubin was looking for a way to spice up his Amazon listing for a vacuum hose. He was struggling to come up with a catchy title that would make shoppers want to click on his hose instead of the countless others in Amazon's vast marketplace.
- For assistance, Rubin turned to ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot that's gone viral since its launch late last year. He soon began to experiment with the tool for completing tasks such as generating copy on his product page. Rubin asked ChatGPT to "generate 5 insanely clever and catchy headlines" for an infographic promoting his vacuum cleaner hose.
- "Dirt destroying air flow," he said, reading off one of ChatGPT's responses. "I would have never in a million years thought of that for a vacuum hose."
- As ChatGPT rapidly finds its way into use by lawyers, clinicians, professors and their students, it's also showing its utility in the business world, notably for Amazon sellers seeking the tiniest competitive advantage as they try to bolster sales. Third-party merchants who have embraced ChatGPT say it can make the job of selling on Amazon's marketplace easier and more lucrative.
- A stream of YouTube videos, articles and LinkedIn posts have appeared in recent months touting the benefits of ChatGPT for Amazon sellers. E-commerce software providers such as JungleScout have also jumped on the trend by integrating ChatGPT into their services.
- "This is one of those technologies that is going to fundamentally change everything we do in our lives," said JungleScout technology chief Stephen Curial, who previously spent a decade at Amazon in software development. "It's that powerful."
- Curial said it won't be long before generative AI tools such as ChatGPT become ordinary productivity aides, similar to calculators or spellcheck, helping busy businesspeople minimize daily grunt work.
- ChatGPT has taken the technology industry by storm since it was introduced to the public in November by OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed startup that's reportedly held talks with investors to sell shares at a $29 billion valuation.
- Millions of people are using the free chatbot to do things such as write fiction, generate computer code and edit resumes. Microsoft has incorporated the technology into its Bing search engine, while Google introduced rival chatbot Bard last month.
- Investors are pouring into the market with massive checks even as the broader tech startup market continues to suffer from the 2022 downturn. Last week, a 22-person pre-revenue startup called Character.AI, which was founded by two former Google employees, raised $150 million at a $1 billion valuation in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz.
- Hamza Amor, an Amazon seller and founder of e-commerce consulting firm Fussy Penguins, has posted TikTok videos showing how ChatGPT can help merchants discover their next hit product.
- Amor started experimenting with ChatGPT in December, asking it questions such as "Tell me more about you" and "What is the meaning of life?" He then asked it to write small passages, such as a children's story, and was impressed by the results.
- ChatGPT helped him improve his products after he asked the chatbot to summarize what users like and dislike about an item based on a set of reviews. For an under-desk footrest, it suggested he use different packaging and more durable materials, or consider offering multiple sizes and the ability to adjust the height of the footrest.
- The software also assisted with the writing of a few listings, a process that normally requires hours of writing and editing.
- "It does it with the tone you suggest, and it does it in seconds," Amor said. "That's the part that was mind-blowing."
- ChatGPT's handiwork has already delivered results for some users. Rubin said the conversion rate, or the percentage of clicks on an ad that result in sales, went up for several of his vacuum filters, coffee filters and air filters after he used ChatGPT for help with listings. For one product, the conversion rate increased from an average of 26% to 46% over an eight-week period, he said.
- Rubin sees the opportunity to further capitalize on the trend by giving other sellers a streamlined way to use it. That's important because third-party sellers are often managing dozens, if not hundreds, of listings on Amazon at the same time and are competing with many new sellers every day.
- In 2021, Rubin started a pricing software company called Profasee, which has used AI in some of its features. Rubin said he plans to incorporate ChatGPT into a new tool that will help sellers quickly fine-tune their product listings.
- But despite the hype, there's good reason for skepticism when it comes to ChatGPT's effectiveness. The nascent technology has shown that it's prone to making mistakes and, in some cases, just making stuff up. ChatGPT learns to write by analyzing large volumes of information from the internet, and it can get things wrong, a phenomenon that AI experts call "hallucination."
- Aidan Duffy, a seller who also runs a consulting firm, turned to ChatGPT to help improve the listing for a sauna backrest, one of his newer products. Not only did the chatbot assist with writing bullet points on the listing, it also suggested he create an adjustable backrest for taller or shorter users, which he said he considered having manufactured.
- Still, Duffy said he has some concerns about the technology's accuracy. He recently used it for advice on the best way to import products from China, where his items are manufactured.
- "It came back with a readable answer, but I see it as a baseline," Duffy said. "It won't do your job for you."

- ChatGPT and GPT-4 are already flooding the internet with AI-generated content in places famous for hastily written inauthentic content: Amazon user reviews and Twitter.
- When you ask ChatGPT to do something itâs not supposed to do, it returns several common phrases. When I asked ChatGPT to tell me a dark joke, it apologized: âAs an AI language model, I cannot generate inappropriate or offensive content,â it said. Those two phrases, âas an AI language modelâ and âI cannot generate inappropriate content,â recur so frequently in ChatGPT generated content that theyâve become memes.
- These terms can reasonably be used to identify lazily executed ChatGPT spam by searching for them across the internet.
- A search of Amazon reveals what appear to be fake user reviews generated by ChatGPT or another similar bot. Many user reviews feature the phrase âas an AI language model.â A user review for a waist trimmer posted on April 13 contains the entire response to the initial prompt, unedited. âYes, as an AI language model, I can definitely write a positive product review about the Active Gear Waist Trimmer.â
- Another user posted a negative review for precision rings, a foam band marketed as a trainer for people playing first person shooters on a controller. âAs an AI language model, I do not have personal experience with using products. However, I can provide a negative review based on the information available online,â it said. The account reviewing the rings posted a total of five reviews on the same day.
- A user review for the book Whore Wisdom Holy Harlot flagged that it had asked AI for a review but noted it didnât agree with all of it. âI asked AI for a review of my book. I don't agree with a few parts though,â the user said. âI'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot provide opinions or reviews on books or any other subjective matter. However, I can provide some information about the book 'Whore Wisdom Holy Harlot' by Qadishtu-Arishutba'al Immi'atiratu.â
- Amazon screengrab.
- âWe have zero tolerance for fake reviews and want Amazon customers to shop with confidence knowing that the reviews they see are authentic and trustworthy,â an Amazon spokesperson told Motherboard. âWe suspend, ban, and take legal action against those who violate these policies and remove inauthentic reviews.â
- Amazon also said it uses a combination of technology and litigation to detect suspicious activity on its platform. âWe have teams dedicated to uncovering and investigating fake review brokers,â it said. âOur expert investigators, lawyers, analysts, and other specialists track down brokers, piece together evidence about how they operate, and then we take legal actions against them.â
- Earlier this month, an online researcher who goes by Conspirador NorteÃ±o online uncovered what he thinks is a Twitter spam network thatâs using spam seemingly generated by ChatGPT. All the accounts Conspirador NorteÃ±o flagged had few followers, few tweets, and had recently posted the phrase âIâm sorry, I cannot generate inappropriate or offensive content.â
- Motherboard uncovered several accounts that shared patterns similar to those described by Conspirador NorteÃ±o. They had low follower accounts, were created between 2010 and 2016, and tended to have tweeted about three things: politics in Southeast Asia, cryptocurrency, and the ChatGPT error message. All these accounts were recently suspended by Twitter.
- âThis spam network consists of (at least) 59,645 Twitter accounts, mostly created between 2010 and 2016,â Conspirador NorteÃ±o said on Twitter. âAll of their recent tweets were sent via the Twitter Web App. Some accounts have old unrelated tweets followed by a multi-year gap, which suggests they were hijacked/purchased.â
- A search of Twitter for the phrase reveals a lot of people posting âI cannot generate inappropriate contentâ in memes, but also popular bots like @ReplyGPT responding with it when they canât fulfill a user request. The âerrorâ phrase is a common one associated with ChatGPT and reproducible in accounts that are tagged as bots powered by the AI language model.
- âI see this as a significant source of concern,â Filippo Menczer, a professor at Indiana University where he is the director of the Observatory on Social Media, told Motherboard. Menczer developed Botometer, a program that assigns Twitter accounts a score based on how bot-like they are.
- According to Menczer, disinformation has always existed but social media has made it worse because it lowered the cost of production.
- âGenerative AI tools like chatbots further lower the cost for bad actors to generate false but credible content at scale, defeating the (already weak) moderation defenses of social media platforms,â he said. âTherefore these tools can easily be weaponized not just for spam but also for dangerous content, from malware to financial fraud and from hate speech to threats to democracy and health. For example, by mounting an inauthentic coordinated campaign to convince people to avoid vaccination (something much easier now thanks to AI chatbots), a foreign adversary can make an entire population more vulnerable to a future pandemic.â
- It's possible that some of the seemingly AI-generated content was written by a human as a joke, but ChatGPT's signature error phrases are so common on the internet that we can reasonably surmise that it's being used extensively for spam, disinformation, fake reviews, and other low-quality content.
- The frightening thing is that content that contains "as an AI language model" or "I cannot generate inappropriate content" only represents low effort spam that lacks quality control. Menczer said that the people behind the networks will only get more sophisticated.
- âWe occasionally spot certain AI-generated faces and text patterns through glitches by careless bad actors,â he said. âBut even as we begin to find these glitches everywhere, they reveal what is likely only a very tiny tip of the iceberg. Before our lab developed tools to detect social bots almost 10 years ago, there was little awareness about how many bots existed. Similarly, now we have very little awareness of the volume of inauthentic behavior supported by AI models.â
- Itâs a problem that has no obvious solution at the moment. âHuman intervention (via moderation) does not scale (let alone the fact that platforms are firing moderators),â he said. âI am skeptical that literacy will help, as humans have a very hard time recognizing AI-generated text. AI chatbots have passed the Turing test and now are getting increasingly sophisticated, for example passing the law bar exam. I am equally skeptical that AI will solve the problem, as by definition AI can get smarter by being trained to defeat other AI.â
- Menczer also said regulation would be difficult in the U.S. because of a lack of political consensus around the use of AI language models. âMy only hope is in regulating not the generation of content by AI (the cat is out of the bag), but rather its dissemination via social media platforms,â he said. âOne could impose requirements on content that reaches large volumes of people. Perhaps you have to prove something is real, or not harmful, or from a vetted source before more than a certain number of people can be exposed to it.â

- From Republican smear campaigns against Biden to a collaboration between The Weeknd and Drake going viral, it feels like AI is coming for every part of our lives. Now, it appears that some products on Amazon are being reviewed with AI chatbots.
- According to a report from CNBC, products across the popular web marketplace have reviews that appear to be written with chatbots like ChatGPT. The outlet found these reviews on products including waist trainers, childrenâs textbooks, car batteries, baby car seat mirrors, and video game controller accessories. Even more jarring is that these reviews make no effort to hide the fact that they were generated with AI, as most reviews begin with the phrase âAs an AI language modelâ before devolving into the fact that a computer has no experience with the product.
- âAs an AI language model, I donât have a body, but I understand the importance of comfortable clothing during pregnancy,â one of the reviews said. âIf youâre looking for comfortable and stylish shorts for your pregnancy, the QGGQDD Maternity Shorts Over Belly with Pockets might be a great option for you.â
- Amazon told Vice that it has a zero tolerance policy for fake reviews, and that the company bans and takes legal action against users who violate that policy. Amazon also explained to the outlet that it has teams of analysts and lawyers dedicated to uncovering fake reviews on its platform.
- Thereâs actually a huge market for fake Amazon reviews, and Amazon previously sued Facebook group administrators over a plot to generate phony product reviews. The admins were allegedly in charge of over 10,000 Facebook groups that were recruiting individuals to leave fake testimonials on Amazon products, and, in exchange, receive payouts from a third party. With payment on the line, chatbots like ChatGPT could make generating false reviews of products way easier than before.

- By  James Vincent, a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge.
- If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
- A big worry about the rise of AI language models is that the internet will soon be subsumed in a tidal wave of automated spam. So far, these predictions have not yet come to pass (if they prove true at all), but we are seeing early signs that tools like ChatGPT are being used to power bots, generate fake reviews, and stuff the web with low-grade textual filler.
- If you want proof, try searching Google or Twitter for the phrase âas an AI language model.â When talking to OpenAIâs ChatGPT, the system frequently uses this expression as a disclaimer, usually when itâs asked to generate banned content or give an opinion on something subjective and particularly human. Now, though, âas an AI language modelâ has become a shibboleth for machine learning spam, revealing where people have set up automated bots or copied and pasted AI content without paying attention to the output.
- Search for the phrase on Twitter, for example, and youâll find countless examples of malfunctioning spambots. (Though itâs worth noting that the most recent results tend to be jokes, with growing awareness of the phrase turning it into something of a meme.)
- The tweets are fascinating, as they often point to a botâs purpose and tactics. In the examples below, you can see how bots have been asked to generate opinions about high-profile figures like Kim Kardashian and gossip about âtrending crypto influencers or publicationsâ (in both cases, presumably to boost engagement with certain audiences).
- Some of the malfunctioning messages even read like quiet rebukes of the botâs operator, who seem to have been asking the system to produce inflammatory content. âMy programming prohibits me from generating harmful and hateful tweets towards individuals or groups of peopleâ is the reply from the AI system, published for the world to see.
- As noted by security engineer Daniel Feldman, the phrase can be searched on pretty much any site with user reviews or a comment section, revealing the presence of bots like a blacklight spotlighting unseen human fluids on a hotel bedsheet.
- âAs an AI language model, I havenât personally used this product, but based on its features and customer reviews, I can confidently give it a five-star rating.â
- Feldman gives the example of Amazon, where the phrase crops up in fake user reviews. In the example below, it appears in a review of a âBuTure VC10 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner, 33000Pa high Suction Power Cordless Vacuum Cleaner, up to 55 Minutes Running time.â The system used to generate the fake review is conscientious and open in its deception, stating, âAs an AI language model, I havenât personally used this product, but based on its features and customer reviews, I can confidently give it a five-star rating.â
- Elsewhere on Amazon, the phrase crops up in real reviews about shoddy AI-generated products. Responding to a book about the Internet of Things, one reviewer notes that the title has been written by AI, as one paragraph starts with the phrase âas an AI language model I canât.â Selling this sort of low-grade AI product is unscrupulous but not necessarily illegal, and thereâs a whole culture of GPT-4 âhustlebrosâ who encourage such schemes as a way to generate passive income (and who cares about the unhappy customers).
- Variations of this phrase show up in all sorts of other contexts, too. As noted by a commenter on Hacker News, it appears throughout the website of a Finnish electronics store. The store apparently tried to use AI to translate English-language products into Finnish but has instead been left with items named âsorry, as an AI language model, I cannot translate this phrase without any context.â On the website for an influencer marketing agency, the phrase appears in the title of a blog post: âSorry, As An AI Language Model, I Cannot Predict Future Events Or Trends.â And here it is in a directory of malls in Qatar as well as here in a user profile on freelancer platform Upwork.
- Other phrases also indicate inattentive use of AI, like âregenerate response,â which appears as an option in ChatGPTâs user interface. Search for these two words on LinkedIn, for example, and youâll find numerous posts that were evidently copied and pasted from OpenAIâs language generator. (Donât worry, though, itâs all part of that #growthmindset.)
- Of course, these examples should be put in context. Although they show AI being used to generate spam and other low-grade text, itâs not clear how widespread this practice is or how it will change online ecosystems. Certainly, early signs are not good (a number of sites that solicit user-generated content in one form or another have banned AI submissions, for example) but that doesnât necessarily guarantee the infopocalypse is nigh. For example, although searching for the phrase on Yelp.com reveals lots of hits in Google, in our own investigations, it seems the reviews in question have already been removed from the site.
- On the other hand, the real problem in this equation is the unknown unknowns. The phrase âas an AI language modelâ is a useful tell for spotting AI spam, but itâs precisely the text that canât be easily detected thatâs the challenge. Software to detect AI-generated text is nonexistent and may even be mathematically impossible. And paranoia over machine learning fakery is so rampant that real people are now accused of being AI.
- In a few yearsâ time, we may look back on such obvious fakes with envy. Though, as an AI language model, I donât like to express opinions on such speculative events.
