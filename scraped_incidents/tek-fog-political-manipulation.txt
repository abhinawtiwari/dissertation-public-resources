- India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stands accused of using a secret software application named Tek Fog to manipulate public opinion and intimidate, harass, and abuse political opponents.
- A detailed, multi-part investigation by The Wire after a whistleblower tip-off indicated that the BJP had been artificially inflating the party's popularity, harassing its critics and manipulating public opinion across a number of major social media and mobile platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter.
- The revelations prompted public condemnation from politicians, rights groups, The Editor's Guild, and The Delhi Union of Journalists, and has spurred an investigation by India's Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs.
- In November 2022, The Wire said it would review its TekFog series in the wake on a controversial investigation conducted by the same team of journalists.

- Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha member Derek O'Brien has written a letter to Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs requesting for a meeting to discuss the "Tek Fog" app which he termed a "threat" to national security and privacy of citizens.
- Alleging that through the app, social media trends are being manipulated, O'Brien on Monday said there was an urgent need to discuss this "manipulation" of social media. This happens to be his second letter to Congress leader and panel chief Anand Sharma in the matter.
- Citing a news report, the MP said that some people associated with BJP's IT cell used to send messages to people through inactive WhatsApp accounts and control the social media trends. All this was done with the help of "Tek Fog" app, he claimed.
- Not just this, messages containing spyware were sent to people through the app to hack their accounts or phones. The app messages were also sent from phones that were not in use anymore, he added.
- O'Brien said as per reports, the app is capable of sending automatic messages to WhatsApp groups or any private number.
- The app, he alleged, can also modify existing news articles and their links, styling the fake news articles. Some technologies have been created by companies such as OpenAL and Salesforce, which have expertise in artificial intelligence.
- The application can spread misinformation on social media though fake news, mislead individual citizens and manipulate political narratives, he added.
- "Since the Tek Fog app is a threat to national security, the rights of expression and free media besides the privacy and security of citizens, I request you to convene a meeting of the Standing Committee," the letter stated.--IANS

Tek Fog app row | Editors Guild demands Supreme Court probe
- On January 6,
The Wire had reported that people associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) IT cell were purportedly using the Tek Fog app to take control of inactive WhatsApp accounts, send messages to frequently contacted numbers, and “hijack” trending topics on social media platforms like Twitter.
- In his letter to Mr. Sharma, the TMC leader wrote, “The existence and usage of manipulative technologies like Tek Fog is a severe danger to national and citizens’ security, a violation of our Fundamental Rights to Privacy and Free Speech, an exploitation of public discourse, and a defilement of the country’s democracy and security.”
- Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury too is said to have written to Mr. Sharma to ask for a meeting on Tek Fog.
- Separately, the Editors Guild of India had issued a statement in which it urged the Supreme Court to take note and order a probe.

- BJP seems to have re-discovered the original intent of Mark Zuckerberg when he set up a website for Harvard University students, which was later to become Facebook, the social media giant that it is today. Zuckerberg set it up essentially as a tool for students to shame each other and their professors.
- But as the Harvard dropout’s epoch-making initiative grew in stature, his platform evolved into one of the most effective communication media for the masses, bringing people together, empowering the voiceless and a load of other benefits, with the original hate resource becoming only an aberration.
- But unfortunately, this potential for mischief has developed into a highly sophisticated tool, which is being used to subvert democracy and hijack popular will. The most high-profile instance of such misuse was attributed to Russia to influence the outcome of the US presidential elections, for which Zuckerberg himself has had to pay dearly.
- India’s ruling dispensation has been one of the early adopters of social media to drum up support for itself and has employed an army of cyber warriors to influence public opinion. But with the supersonic speed at which technology is evolving, there is no need even for people to carry on the clandestine operation as the role has been taken over by bots, which will manipulate social media accounts to distort public opinion and make it appear to be in favour of the ruling party and its leaders.
- A disgruntled staff member of the ruling party’s cyber cell has now revealed that it has been using a browser-based application named Tek Fog to infiltrate social media platforms to spread misinformation, target journalists, particularly women reporters and home in on anyone it deems an opponent. It can be used against anyone who expresses dissent and apparently used against opposition parties, social activists and anyone found to take a stand that is not to the comfort of the ruling establishment.
- According to reports, Tek Fog is much more powerful than the tools allegedly used by Russian agents in the US election campaign. The new generation product can enable social media operatives to tap into Twitter and Facebook accounts and manipulate trending subjects by automatically sharing or retweeting posts, and targeting existing hashtags to commandeer the narrative on the platforms. This was apparently being used to spread fake news as well, while creating the impression that a certain type of opinion, which is in favour of the ruling party and its leaders, is the most dominant view. Conversely, the technique has been used to suppress adverse opinion as well.
- Worse still, the tool has allegedly been used to steal identities and log into inactive accounts to manipulate trending subjects. The programme also allowed users to easily create temporary email addresses and bypass authentication systems, which is the ultimate cyber security threat, which the government has been shouting about from the rooftops.
- It not only exposes the hollowness of the Modi government’s pious declarations about privacy, but brings out the real intent. In a way, there is no surprise in the sense it reflects the scant respect that the saffron party has for democratic institutions and the rights of the citizens and the tendency to justify anything in the name of nationalism.
- Another most worrying aspect about the tool’s use by the ruling party operatives is that it is a military-grade solution that is nevertheless available to only state players for use against enemies. It is deeply distressing that it has landed up in the hands of the ruling party, which is not a state player in any sense of the term.
- This means that it may have been acquired by the government for use against ‘enemies’, which according to the saffron concept could include its own citizens if they don’t fall in line with the government’s approach and thinking, and then passed on to the ruling party for use against anyone opposed to it. We haven’t yet reached a situation where the line separating the party and the government is not yet completely fogged and got blurred. This should in turn raise serious questions about the use of Tek Fog by the ruling party, even if one manages to invent some reasons for its use against the country’s citizens themselves.

- For much of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nearly eight years in power, the relationship between social media platforms, journalists and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has been nasty and vitriolic, and almost always murky. Now we can start to understand why.
- A browser-based application was reportedly used by the BJP to infiltrate social media platforms in order to spread misinformation, target female reporters and home in on anyone it deems an opponent. A report published last week by The Wire, an independent Indian news publication, documented the mechanics and strategy behind the computer program, which is known as Tek Fog, according to a whistleblower claiming to be a disgruntled employee of the ruling party's information technology cell. It's unclear when the system came into being, but The Wire has been investigating the claims made by the unidentified source for two years.
- Opposition parties have denounced the app as a national security threat, and asked Parliament to probe it, while Modi has remained silent on the revelations. His party didn't respond to an email seeking comment. The Wire article named Devang Dave, a former head of social media at the BJP's youth wing, as a supervisor of the Tek Fog operatives. Following the expose, Dave released an email to The Wire in which he denied that the party had ever used - or known about - a secret app to manipulate public opinion.
- The BJP, the most well-funded of all Indian political parties, has been an early adopter of information technology. It has harnessed the power of databases and its well-equipped IT cell to target voters. But a misogynistic and abusive app meant to instill fear among journalists and critics goes beyond the pale of acceptable political marketing. Indeed, it would be a "travesty of all democratic norms, and in violation of law," as the Editors Guild of India said in a statement.
- For some of the reporters who have been subject to attack, the revelations are a vindication - even a relief. "I'm happy to know that it isn't actually a human being lighting up my phone with disgusting, sexually colored abuse on a daily basis, but bots," says Swati Chaturvedi, a New Delhi-based investigative journalist. "Still, what message does it send about our democracy when private citizens are systematically attacked by a call center of hate?" Chaturvedi has been a target for harassment since publishing her 2016 book, "I Am A Troll: Inside the Secret World of the BJP's Digital Army."
- The use of bots to distort public opinion is reminiscent of what Russian operatives did on Facebook in advance of the U.S. presidential election.
- Tek Fog is much more powerful. From a technical perspective, the reach and effectiveness of this new software is both impressive and deeply worrying. According to the report, users of the platform could tap into and manipulate the trending features on Twitter and Facebook - by automatically sharing or retweeting posts, and targeting existing hashtags - to commandeer the narrative on India's most widely used social media services. This simple tactic could then amplify propaganda, in order to make a particular idea or opinion appear more popular than it really was, or to shout down opposing views.
- More alarming is Tek Fog's ability to access the contact lists of inactive accounts on Meta Platforms Inc.'s WhatsApp service to disseminate messages and steal personal information. This allowed operatives to be much more precise in their messaging, while also building a database of future targets. The result was brutal. Perceived opponents, including female journalists, were subsequently harassed and trolled across a variety of social media platforms in an attempt to scare them into silence.
- That such a merciless campaign could be conducted so efficiently can be partially explained by the social media firms' strategic decision to make their products accessible through external connections known as application programming interfaces, or APIs. This functionality is ostensibly designed for convenience - you can easily tweet a chosen article directly from a media outlet's website without going to twitter.com.
- Internet companies love it. This convenient access ensures more users, greater engagement and a rising trove of data that they can then tap to sell more targeted ads. But there is a flip side to APIs. As The Wire outlined, Tek Fog allowed users to easily create temporary email addresses and bypass authentication systems - operatives could in effect hack into WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Telegram.
- And hack they did. In a follow-up article, The Wire outlined how Tek Fog exploited vulnerabilities in these APIs to get unprecedented levels of access to social-media platforms. What's more, online operators deployed well-known and sophisticated hacking techniques to create fake news that looked like genuine articles written by the original legitimate authors, complete with realistic URLs.
- With such functionality at their fingertips, the technical prowess of the world's most powerful internet companies - from consumer-friendly apps to efficient data-crunching algorithms - could be brought to bear on anyone standing in the way of misinformation campaigns that demonize minorities, discredit political opposition and brand anyone opposing government policies as anti-national. Conscientious journalists, clear-minded citizens and millions of voters don't stand a chance.
- Some groups are particularly at risk. Police in India recently arrested four suspects, all college students, for scraping the social-media profiles of Muslim women - activists, journalists, actors and politicians - and listing them for sale via an app on GitHub, the Microsoft-owned open software development platform.
- By contrast, Tek Fog is a military-grade PSYOP - psychological operations - weapon. A capability like this has so far been available only to state actors for use against enemy populations, said Anand Venkatnarayanan, an Indian internet security researcher and co-author of a 2021 book on information warfare. "Putting such a weapon in the hands of non-state actors affiliated to a political party contesting for mind space of citizens in a democracy has never been done before."
- It's an effective tool to drown out questioning voices. Rohini Singh, another New Delhi-based journalist who faces online harassment routinely, worries about the future of independent reporting in India, particularly as a woman. "When you wake up to 10,000 abuses in your social-media mentions, it does affect you,"  Singh said. "Earlier, we had to worry about getting a story right. Now we have to worry about rape threats, invasion of our privacy and non-stop slander. None of us signed up for this. Journalism is not a crime."
- Governments might be able to combat misinformation that infiltrates the internet, if they tried. But it's increasingly clear that they can't be relied upon to do so. That's why social-media platforms need to take the lead, and the first step will be to crack down on external access via APIs. From there, tech firms need to implement better auditing systems so that they have greater clarity on who is using their platforms, and how.
- With the internet now such an important tool of modern society, it's incumbent on the companies that operate it to retake control of the technologies they built. Democracy depends on it.

- Social media operatives apparently affiliated to India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) use a specialized app to hijack Twitter trends, harass critics, and spread propaganda through defunct WhatsApp accounts, according to a new investigation by The Wire, an Indian publication.
- The app, called Tek Fog, allows users to bypass controls like email and text-message verification that companies like Twitter and Facebook build into their products. It can also act as a master control for a number of Twitter accounts, fake or otherwise, pushing hashtags, content and retweets through a single interface.
- On WhatsApp, Tek Fog takes over people’s inactive accounts to then message their contacts. “App operators also use this feature to phish the personal information of targeted users to add to a…political database,” The Wire wrote. “The addition of private citizens into this database makes them available as potential targets in future harassment and trolling campaigns.”
- The Wire’s main source, a disgruntled social media worker, was employed by a private tech company, Persistent Systems, and assigned to work with another client company, Mohalla Tech. Mohalla Tech owns ShareChat, a social media platform that operates in Indian languages and is funded in part by Twitter.
- The source also said that they were supervised directly by Devang Dave, the former social media head of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the BJP’s youth wing. Although The Wire could not confirm this link or prove that the BJP directed the use of the app, its reporters conducted a forensic technical analysis and found that users from a BJYM domain accessed Tek Fog. Dave denied that his organization or its members used Tek Fog.
- The investigation is among the clearest pieces of evidence yet of the BJP’s orchestration of online propaganda and hate speech. The party’s “IT cell”—shorthand for hired social media flunkies—includes a vast number of real people manually pushing out content and hate speech.
- But as Tek Fog shows, the BJP also benefits from more sophisticated techniques. And the fact that Persistent Systems has won at least one government contract raises the question of whether the Indian taxpayer is indirectly footing the bill for the BJP’s web campaigns.
- Tek Fog’s manipulation of Twitter includes, at the most basic level, the amplification of pro-BJP hashtags through artificially generated mentions and retweets. It also includes an “auto-reply” function that can target users by religion, age, gender, or profession.
- Between January and April 2021, when The Wire tracked 4.6 million replies received by 280 prominent women journalists, it found that 18% of these replies came from accounts managed by the Tek Fog app. Two separate language analysis tools, from IBM and Amazon, found that a majority of posts posted via Tek Fog to ShareChat could be classified as “hate speech.”

- Due to discrepancies that came to light during its review of the Meta stories, The Wire said it will also review the previous reporting done by the technical team involved in its Meta coverage.
- The Wire has retracted its contentious reports on Meta‚Äôs content moderation policies, the news website announced on Sunday, October 23. Earlier on October 18, The Wire had announced its decision to conduct an internal review of its coverage of Meta ‚Äì a series of reports which began with the sensational claim that the social media giant had given special privileges to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJPS)'s IT cell head Amit Malviya, under its secretive XCheck programme, to have posts taken down as per his wish. The Wire has also removed its stories on Tek Fog ‚Äì an app alleged to have been used by BJP workers to manipulate social media ‚Äì published in January 2022. Due to discrepancies that came to light during its review of the Meta stories, The Wire said it will also review the previous reporting done by the technical team involved in its Meta coverage ‚Äì including the Tek Fog stories co-written by Devesh Kumar, who had also worked on the Meta stories.
- Announcing its retraction of the Meta stories, The Wire said, ‚ÄúWe are still reviewing the entire matter, including the possibility that it was deliberately sought to misinform or deceive The Wire. Lapses in editorial oversight are also being reviewed, as are editorial roles, so that failsafe protocols are put in place ensuring the accuracy of all source-based reporting.‚Äù
- The Wire‚Äôs disputed coverage of Meta began with a story on October 6, about an Instagram post by a meme page being taken down earlier in September. The post by the page Superhumans‚Äô Archive of Cringetopia mocked a video of a man worshipping an idol of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The Wire reported that the post was taken down instantly citing ‚Äòsexual activity and nudity‚Äô, despite not showing such content.
- This was followed by the first sensational story published on October 10, which claimed that Meta had given special privileges to BJP leader Amit Malviya under its controversial XCheck programme to take down posts as he wished, without a review by Meta. The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported that under XCheck, Meta gives special privileges to a few influential users including politicians, with their posts enjoying additional protection compared to regular users. The October 10 story included a screenshot of an internal report of Instagram ‚Äì a post-incident review report which indicated that the deleted post had been reported by Amit Malviya‚Äôs account.
- At this stage, Meta had called the stories fabrications, and also alleged that the internal report cited by The Wire ‚Äúappears to be fabricated‚Äù. A day later, on October 11, The Wire published another story with screenshots of what they claimed was an internal email sent by Andy Stone to his team, in which he purportedly wrote: ‚ÄúHow the hell [Instagram internal report] got leaked? Who is the reporter, not on our watchlist, and why didn‚Äôt any of you bother to link me up?‚Äù The email further asked to put The Wire‚Äôs Jahnavi Sen and Siddharth Varadarajan on a watchlist and to contact them for more information about the Instagram internal document.
- By now, a few independent observers familiar with Meta‚Äôs operations, including Facebook whistleblower Sophie Zhang, journalist Shoshana Wodinsky and former Chief Security Officer at Facebook Alex Stamos, also raised doubts about the authenticity of the documents accessed by The Wire ‚Äì both the Instagram internal document and the Andy Stone email.
- On October 15, The Wire published yet another story, by Devesh Kumar, Jahnavi Sen and Siddharth Varadarajan. Stating that it stood by its stories so far, it posted a video of one of its reporters verifying the authenticity of the Andy Stone email. It said that this verification process was shown to two independent domain experts on a video call, and shared screenshots of emails from these experts ‚Äì Ujjwal Kumar from Microsoft, and another unnamed independent security researcher ‚Äì confirming the validity of their process. Both of these emails were shown to be addressed to Devesh Kumar.
- After this, Pranesh Prakash, co-founder of the Centre for Internet and Society, who was one of the experts initially contacted by The Wire to authenticate the Andy Stone email, raised questions about the outlet's verification process. While he was informed by Siddharth Varadarajan that the unnamed independent security researcher who vetted The Wire‚Äôs email verification process was Kanishk Karan, Kanishk himself denied doing so. More recently, the second expert named in the story Ujjwal Kumar too denied conducting the verification.
- After announcing the decision to review the Meta stories, in an interview with Platformer, The Wire‚Äôs founding editor Siddharth Varadarajan said that its reporter Devesh Kumar was the only person who had met the source who had provided the Instagram incident report. He said that a different source had provided the Andy Stone email ‚Äì someone whom multiple colleagues had interacted with over four to five months.
- After initiating an internal review of the Meta stories, The Wire on Sunday retracted them. Meanwhile, the Tek Fog investigation, co-authored by Ayushman Kaul and Devesh Kumar, has also been taken down. ‚ÄúThis story has been removed from public view pending the outcome of an internal review by The Wire, as one of its authors was part of the technical team involved in our now retracted Meta coverage,‚Äù reads a page, where the link to the Tek Fog story now lands. The investigative report had claimed that an app called Tek Fog was being used by people associated with the BJP's IT cell to manipulate social media by using inactive WhatsApp accounts to spread propaganda, and ‚Äòhijacking‚Äô trending topics on social media platforms.
