- AI-powered characters based on real people can star in thousands of videos and say anything, in any language.
- Like many students, Liri has had several part-time jobs. A 23-year-old in Israel, she does waitressing and bartending gigs in Tel Aviv, where she goes to university.
- She also sells cars, works in retail, and conducts job interviews and onboarding sessions for new employees as a corporate HR rep. In Germany.
- Liri can juggle so many jobs, in multiple countries, because she has hired out her face to Hour One, a startup that uses people’s likenesses to create AI-voiced characters that then appear in marketing and educational videos for organizations around the world. It is part of a wave of companies overhauling the way digital content is produced. And it has big implications for the human workforce.
- Liri does her waitressing and bar work in person, but she has little idea what her digital clones are up to. “It is definitely a bit strange to think that my face can appear in videos or ads for different companies,” she says.
- Hour One is not the only company taking deepfake tech mainstream, using it to produce mash-ups of real footage and AI-generated video. Some have used professional actors to add life to deepfaked personas. But Hour One doesn’t ask for any particular skills. You just need to be willing to hand over the rights to your face.
- Hour One is building up a pool of what it calls “characters.” It says it has around 100 on its books so far, with more being added each week. “We’ve got a queue of people that are dying to become these characters,” says Natalie Monbiot, the company’s head of strategy.
- Anyone can apply to become a character. Like a modeling agency, Hour One filters through applicants, selecting those it wants on its books. The company is aiming for a broad sample of characters that reflect the ages, genders, and racial backgrounds of people in the real world, says Monbiot. (Currently, around 80% of its characters are under 50 years old, 70% are female, and 25% are white.)
- To create a character, Hour One uses a high-resolution 4K camera to film a person talking and making different facial expressions in front of a green screen. And that’s it for the human part of the performance. Plugging the resulting data into AI software that works in a similar way to deepfake tech, Hour One can generate an endless amount of footage of that person saying whatever it wants, in any language.
- Hour One’s clients pay the company to use its characters in promotional or commercial video. They select a face, upload the text they want it to say, and get back a video of what looks like a real person delivering that script to a camera. The quickest service uses text-to-speech software to generate synthetic voices, which are synced with the characters’ mouth movements and facial expressions. Hour One also offers a premium service where the audio is recorded by professional voice actors. These voices are again fitted to the movements of the character in the video. Hour One says it has more than 40 clients, including real estate, e-commerce, digital health, and entertainment firms. One major client is Berlitz, an international language school that provides teacher-led video courses for dozens of languages.
- According to Monbiot, Berlitz wanted to increase the number of videos it offered but struggled to do so using real human actors. They had to have production crews creating the same setup with the same actor over and over again, she says: “They found it really unsustainable. We’re talking about thousands of videos.”
- Berlitz now works with Hour One to generate hundreds of videos in minutes. “We’re replacing the studio,” says Monbiot. “A human being doesn’t need to waste their time filming.”
- After years of activists fighting to protect victims of image-based sexual violence, deepfakes are finally forcing lawmakers to pay attention.
- Another early example of the technology in action is Alice Receptionist, a company that provides firms with an avatar on a screen to handle visitors’ queries, replacing the role of a human receptionist in a range of physical locations in the US. Hour One is working with Alice Receptionist to update its video footage of human actors so that the digital receptionists can be made to say different things in different languages without having to reshoot hours of video.
- Liri, like everyone on Hour One’s books, receives a micropayment every time a client licenses a video that uses her face. Monbiot won’t say exactly how large these payments are except that it’s dollars, not cents. “I can’t say that anyone today is making a living doing this,” she says. “But we think if all goes well it will be a viable way to make an income.”
- By removing the need for film crews, studio technicians, and—for all but a few minutes—actors, Hour One’s technology is a boon to companies wanting to scale up video production, even as it offers a bit of easy money to a handful of people like Liri. But some are troubled by the implications for the future of work.
- “This looks like a fairly extreme case of technology scaling back the human’s role in a particular work process,” says Jessie Hammerling at the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the impact of new technologies on work. Automation doesn’t always eliminate human roles entirely, but it does change those roles in ways that affect people’s ability to earn a fair wage or turn a job into a long-term career, she says.
- Hammerling notes that allowing companies to reuse one-time footage of actors for multiple video projects will reduce the availability of this kind of acting work. According to SAG-AFTRA, a union for US movie, television, and radio performers, many actors do promotional and marketing work for clients like those now working with Hour One.
- SAG-AFTRA says it is important that people hiring out their likeness to firms like Hour One be able to maintain control over how that likeness is used.
- “For a lot of talent, their likenesses are valuable assets that warrant proper protection and compensation for their use,” says a union spokesperson. “There is a risk of being put into content they may object to or that may conflict with other work.”
- Hour One appears to get this right. The firm does not let people have a say in how their likeness will be used or what words will be put into their mouths, but it has an ethics policy specifying that it will not work with certain industries. “We’re pretty conservative about the types of businesses that we work with,” says Monbiot. That means no gambling, no sex, and no politics.
- Liri doesn’t worry too much. She says she trusts Hour One not to use her face for anything that might make her feel uncomfortable. She even recommended the gig to her friends. “I’ve had friends send me videos they’ve seen my face in, which felt very strange,” she says. “All of a sudden, I realized this thing is for real.”
- “I have suddenly switched my views on whether these things are going to be more intelligent than us.”

- Are you looking to make some cash? Are you not worried about the dark implications of AI and its potential uses with your likeness? Good news: There's a company that wants to pay you to deepfake your face for commercial purposes.
- Hour One is a Tel Aviv-based startup that uses real people’s likenesses to create AI-generated "characters" for marketing and educational videos, according to MIT Technology Review. The company currently has a library of roughly 100 characters, and it's looking to expand its roster.
- "We’ve got a queue of people that are dying to become these characters," said Natalie Monbiot, Hour One’s head of strategy, in a very unsettling choice of wording.

- 
- To become a character, you’ll need to apply on their website and submit your name, email address, and Instagram profile.
- You don’t need to have runway model looks or washboard abs either. Hour One is looking to get characters that represent a wide range of ages, genders, and racial makeup, according to Technology Review.
- If Hour One accepts you, the company will film your face talking and making a variety of different facial expressions in front of a green screen using a high-resolution camera. It'll then process the recordings through their AI software and voila! Companies will now be able to purchase an AI likeness of you to say (and sell) whatever it wants for a nominal fee.
- Currently, Hour One creates AI-generated voices to go along with the video. This works a lot like text-to-speech software where you upload a script and an AI speaks it.  The startup also offers a more expensive option where professional voice actors will read your script.
- While the company does have an ethics policy, its language on character protection is shockingly thin — comprising of just three bullet points that vaguely promise to protect "your data assets with utmost security." It'll also label all the synthetic videos of your likeness with a watermark saying that it’s AI-generated.
- You’d hope that Hour One would come up with a more rigorous standard to ensure their character models feel safe about selling their likeness to private companies. After all, these companies can use these characters to say and sell what they want. What happens when a company uses your likeness for something that’s ethically questionable?

- Tech
- With just a short amount of studio time, Hour One can turn anyone into a digital clone. But why?
- There are many innovative uses for artificial intelligence, like efficiently organizing large projects and digitizing everyday tasks. And then there are AI projects that would’ve been better as thought-experiments rather than full-blown business prospects. We’d argue that, for the most part, clones fall into the latter category — but companies like Hour One are betting big that consumers won’t agree with us on that.
- Hour One’s promise to customers is that, after a relatively quick onboarding process, the company’s artificial intelligence can create a fully digital version of you, with the ability to say and do whatever you want it to. The company has partnered with YouTuber Taryn Southern to show off the tech’s capabilities.
- The company’s idea here is one with some merit in an experimental sense: how far can we push the boundaries of AI in creating something entirely new? However, Hour One’s lofty claims about the future of this tech are vastly overstated. And the clones are creepy, too.
- Not a deepfake — Though Hour One hasn’t published all that many details about its technology, Taryn Southern has lent some insight into the company’s processes through an extra behind-the-scenes video.
- The biggest takeaway from this inside look is that Hour One’s clones are not deepfakes. A deepfake is created by manipulating an image to fabricate the likeness of a person, usually on top of existing video footage. Hour One’s clones, in comparison, require studio time to capture a person’s appearance and voice... and, therefore, consent. Southern says she stood in front of a green screen for about seven minutes, read a few scripts, and sang a song.
- This difference is noteworthy in that this capture process allows for a much fuller “cloning” process. Hour One can now feed just about any script into its program and create a video where it appears that Southern is actually reading it. There’s also an extra layer of consent involved — deepfakes are often made without the subject’s approval, but that’s not possible with Hour One’s technology.
- Maybe occasionally useful — The process of “digital cloning” is an interesting line of thought, but we’re failing to see where the technology could really be worth the effort. Unless, of course, you're very famous and in demand and stand to make money by being able to virtually be in multiple places at once.
- Hour One seems to believe AI clones will replace most human-made videos in the very near future: the company says that “experts” predict that in the next five to seven years 90 percent of content will be generated using computers rather than cameras. There is no citation for these "experts," though, so we're going to chalk it up to an overzealous marketing team.
- You only need to take one look at Southern’s “clone” to understand it could never actually replace a newscaster or other camera-facing human, at least not in its current form. And even when the technology has actually caught up to Hour One’s vision, it’s difficult to imagine why anyone would go through the trouble of making an AI clone when they could simply turn on a camera instead. Unless, of course, they're planning to make a posthumous appearance at their daughter's milestone birthday, perhaps.

- Das 2019 in Tel Aviv gegründete Start-up Hour One kauft Lizenzrechte an realen Gesichtern, um diese dann per Deepfake-Technik in Marketing-Videos zu verwenden.
- Kürzlich trat der US-Schauspielstar Bruce Willis in einem russischen Werbefilm auf. Anstatt die strapaziöse Reise und die Dreharbeiten auf sich zu nehmen, verlieh er der produzierenden Firma verhältnismäßig günstig die Rechte an seinem (jungen) Gesicht.
- Fortschrittliche Deepfake-Technologie macht diesen Wandel möglich: Früher hätte sich der Aufwand, Willis‘ Gesicht zu fälschen, nicht rentiert im Verhältnis zu den Kosten für seine schauspielerische Präsenz vor Ort. Doch mit der KI-Klontechnik sind überzeugende Montagen für wenig Geld möglich.
- Für Schauspieler:innen und prominente Personen öffnet sich so ein neues Geschäftsmodell: „Rent my face“. Das israelische Start-up Hour One will diesen Nebenverdienst für jedermann ermöglichen.

- Die 23-jährige Studentin Lira hat ihr Gesicht an Hour One lizenziert: Deepfake-Varianten ihrer selbst treten in Werbevideos für Autos auf oder in Einarbeitungsvideos für neue Angestellte.
- Es ist ein kurzer Weg für Lira in ihre Nebenkarriere als Multimodel: Vor einem Greenscreen spricht sie zehn Minuten in eine herkömmliche 4K-Kamera. Dabei zeigt sie verschiedene Gesichtsausdrücke. Für die Aufnahme muss sie nicht einmal in ein Studio fahren – die gesamte Produktion kann remote und in der Cloud ablaufen.
- Liras Deepfake-Avatar kann in vielen Rollen und Videos auftreten. | Bild: Hour One
- Mit GAN-Technologie (Entwicklung) erstellt Hour One anhand der Aufnahmen einen KI-Klon ihres Gesichts, der ebenfalls mit KI-generierter Stimme vertont werden kann. Dieser Klon kann dann vor verschiedenen Hintergründen in die Kamera sprechen und etwa durch animierte Marketing-Präsentationen leiten.
- So wird Lira zum Gesicht verschiedener Marken in unterschiedlichen Ländern, ohne dass sie jemals direkt mit diesen Marken oder ihren Inhalten in Kontakt tritt. „Freunde haben mir Videos geschickt, in denen sie mein Gesicht gesehen haben, was sich sehr seltsam anfühlt“, sagt Lira.
- „Hour One Charaktere sind menschlich und man fühlt sich mit ihnen verbunden. Sie passen konsistent zur Marke, Tage mit schlechter Frisur gibt es nicht“, beschreibt Hour One die Vorteile der KI-Marketing-Gesichter.
- Die Firma verspricht Unternehmensvideos „zu einem Bruchteil der Kosten, in Minutenschnelle, in jeder Sprache, zur Eigenbearbeitung und in großem Umfang.“ Zahlreiche Demovideos, auch mit Lira, gibt es auf der offiziellen Webseite zu sehen.
- Mietbare Deepfakes wie jenen von Lira bezeichnet Hour One als „Charakter“. Rund 100 davon hat das Start-up in einer Datenbank. Viele weitere sollen folgen.
- Laut Hour-One-Strategiechefin Natalie Monbiot ist die Nachfrage, in die Datenbank aufgenommen zu werden, groß: „Wir haben eine Warteschlange mit Leuten, die unbedingt ein Charakter werden wollen.“
- Kunden von Hour One suchen sich ihren favorisierten Charakter aus dieser Datenbank aus. Dann übermitteln sie den Text, den sie eingesprochen haben wollen. Dieser wird entweder multilingual per KI-Stimme vertont oder für einen Aufpreis professionell eingesprochen und dann mit dem Deepfake-Gesicht synchronisiert.
- Hour One agiert bei der Auswahl der Charaktere wie eine Modelagentur und möchte ein breites Spektrum verschiedener Persönlichkeiten unterschiedlicher Herkunft KI-klonen. „Wir ersetzen das Studio“, sagt Monbiot. „Ein Mensch muss seine Zeit nicht mehr mit Filmen verschwenden.“
- Von den Einnahmen leben können die realen Menschen hinter den Hour One Deepfake-Charakteren nicht, aber laut Monbiot soll der Service zukünftig die Chance auf ein „gutes Einkommen“ bieten – „wenn alles gut geht“.
- Wer sein Gesicht an Hour One verleiht, hat bei den anschließenden Produktionen kein Mitspracherecht. Hour One sichert allerdings zu, dass ethisch potenziell problematische Bereiche wie Glücksspiel, Pornografie oder Politik nicht bedient werden.
- 40 Unternehmen zählt das Start-up laut eigenen Angaben zu seinen Kunden, darunter mit Berlitz eine internationale Sprachschule mit Videokursen. Das folgende Video zeigt eine Unternehmenspräsentation von Monbiot aus dem Mai 2020.

- By subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Policies You may unsubscribe at any time.
- Do you need money? Of course you do.
- If you can tolerate a degree of ambiguity and ethical gray zones, a startup will buy a digital deepfake copy of your face via which artificial intelligence software will sell people products and education services, according to a recent report from MIT Technology Review.
- As of writing, the company has roughly 100 composite "faces" lined up. And it wants to add yours.
- "We've got a queue of people that are dying to become these characters," said Hour One's Strategy Lead Natalie Monbiot, in the report from MIT. To join the small army of brainless faces of the marketing world, deepfake hopefuls can apply on the company's website, where you can submit your Instagram profile, email address, and your (real) name. Naturally, model-tier faces aren't necessary, since Hour One wants to use a diverse repertoire of faces, of all ages, genders, and races. If you get picked, the firm will film your face speaking and contorting into a wide array of facial expressions with a green-screen background and a high-res camera. With footage in hand, the company will feed your likenesses into an AI system, which will build a composite character with which the company can sell whatever it wants.
- As of writing, Hour One develops AI-generated voices to match each video, which isn't overwhelmingly different from text-to-speech software that enables AI to speak whatever you write. Presently, the startup says it's working with more than 40 clients, including firms from e-commerce, entertainment, real estate, and digital health. The AI startup can also offer client companies an elite package where it hires professional voice actors to stand in for your composite face, and read the sales script. One of Hour One's clients is Berlitz, a school for international language that generates teacher-led video courses on dozens of languages. Berlitz hired the company to increase the number of videos it can offer consumers, but it ran into a snag using human talent, since their production crews employed the same setup repeatedly, leading to a sense of stale redundancy. "They found it really unsustainable," noted Monbiot, in the MIT report. "A human being doesn't need to waste their time filming."
- On the subject of profit margins alone, this is a win-win for all involved and a historic step in the application of AI software capabilities in the private sector. But like every new technology, it has a dark side. Obviously, the AI startup has an ethics policy, but the language describing character security is surprisingly loose, made up of only three bullet points and an ambiguous commitment to protect "your data assets with utmost security." For an added measure, the company will stamp every synthetic video of your digitized face with a watermark, affirming its artificial origin. But is it enough?
- "This looks like a fairly extreme case of technology scaling back the human's role in a particular work process," said Jessie Hammerling of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California, Berkeley, in the MIT report. This means that, while providing a perfect composite "middle-man" for human interaction on visual platforms and advertising, it's not only the security of the base-person's facial identity that could be at a higher risk, but also the prospect of humans who are used to the idea of building an in-person career in jobs that are emulated to increasing fidelity by nascent deepfake and other AI capabilities. And without recourse to an alternative or universal basic income, there may come a day when significant populations of real human beings have to search much harder to earn a living.

- With every passing day, scientists and researchers are coming up with ways to incorporate technology in ways that were not known before. This brings innovation, convenience, and improved living standards in our lives. An up-and-coming aspect of technology is Artificial Intelligence. This has brought forward a side of endless possibilities. It is being applied in multiple fields and the results are amazing.
- Recently, it has been proposed that the principles of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be applied in the media industry. A deepfake impression will be created of real-life people which will then be transmitted on the internet or television for advertisements. Companies are now looking for people who will be willing to consent to the making of their deepfakes.
- However, there is always a possibility of this data being used in a negative way as AI has its implications for both positive and negative purposes. Nevertheless, organizations are paying, and people will be willing to get involved.
- For the purpose of making marketing and educational videos, there is a startup that is based in Tel-Aviv that uses deepfake and Artificial Intelligence. The name of the company is Hour One. According to MIT Technology Review, Hour One makes AI characters in these videos. Currently, they are looking for more faces and people to expand their database. They already have a hundred faces in their system.
- In order to register with them, one has to provide the name, email address, and Instagram profile. They are diversity inclusive and are looking for people with different age brackets, backgrounds, and ethnicities. In front of a green screen, people are made to record videos with different facial expressions. These videos are then uploaded to their software and the impressions are created. Companies can then buy these impressions for a nominal fee.
- The video will include a watermark saying it is AI-generated. Still, the video can be used for ethically questioning content.

- 
- I often say that the only way to finish all the chores I have in a day is to clone myself. Well, now I can do it, sort of. Hour One is a company that lets you create a “digital clone” of yourself. This way you can create videos, tutorials, even do online job interviews or any kind of presentation without actually being there.
- 
- 
- 
- Hour One presented the technology to the world in collaboration with YouTuber Taryn Southern. They created an AI clone of her, which is the one you can see in the video above. For a bit of behind the scenes, you can take a look at this one:
- 
- The process behind cloning someone digitally sounds relatively simple. You’ll need a little bit of time in front of the camera though, but it only took Taryn seven minutes. Compared to countless videos she could make out of the result, that’s nothing. What’s more, her Ai character speaks different languages and it can even sing. This way, she can create more varied content and create it in many different languages. All she needs to do is submit the text that her AI character will read.
- While this technology reminds me of deepfake, it’s not the same. With deepfakes, you can put someone else’s face on an already existing video of someone else. To create this digital clone, you need input from a real person and from there you can create multiple videos that look as if they’re talking. You can create completely new videos with the digital character instead of filming someone else and adding a different face to the footage.
- Just like deepfake, digital cloning isn’t quite there yet, at least not all the time. Some parts of the footage look completely realistic, but in others, you can see that something is off. It’s usually visible in the lips as they don’t always perfectly sync with the words. But again, just like deepfake – the technology will only become better and more sophisticated with time.
- The AI Taryn jokingly says that she can now relaunch her YouTube channel and create videos “without the real Taryn having to shower or leave her bed.” I don’t know, if I can’t leave my bed and take a shower it means it’s high time for meds and psychotherapy, but to each their own. Joke aside, it could come in handy for YouTubers, vloggers, even TV anchors. The possibilities are almost endless, but it also has a downside.
- A real person is needed to create a digital copy of them, so this is comforting in a way. You can just digitally clone someone out of thin air. However, if anyone other than Taryn gets access to her AI clone, they could submit any text and make it look as if she said it. The possibilities of misuse are endless hereto. But then again – the same thing can be done with deepfake technology, and I remember already seeing some examples. Useful technology in the wrong hands is always a terrible thing.
- I’m both intrigued and freaked out by digital cloning, but I’m nevertheless curious to see where it will go and how it will be used. It’s already possible to get a digital clone of your own. So if you’re more intrigued than you are afraid – you can apply here and get an AI version of yourself. I’d rather have a real Dunja clone to do the housework and grocery shopping so I can do my art projects in peace, but I guess we’re still pretty far from that.
