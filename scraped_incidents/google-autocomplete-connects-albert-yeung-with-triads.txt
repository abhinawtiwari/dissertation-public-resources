- Emperor Group founder and CEO Dr. Albert Yeung won a court case against Google in August 2014 in which he had accused the technology company's Autocomplete search prediction function of defaming him by associating him with terms such as 'triad' and the names of individuals triad gangs.
- Per Columbia University's Global Freedom of Expression project, 'the main issue (..) was whether Google could be considered a publisher of the defamatory information by merely creating an automated service. Furthermore, even if Google could not be considered a direct publisher of the information, a second issue was whether Google could still be liable as a publisher for being aware of the defamatory information and refusing to take it down.'
- 'Finally, a third issue considered by the Court was whether Yeung had actually suffered any damages, and if he had not, whether this action could amount to an interference with freedom of expression leading to an abuse of process,' the project notes.
- The court dismissed the case, awarding damages to Yeung on the basis that Google operated and could amend Autopilot as it saw fit, and could therefore be considered a publisher. However, Google challenged the verdict, with the court allowing the case to go to an appeals court.
- Yeung had a checkered career and private life, having been variously arrested and imprisoned for perverting the course of justice, illegal bookmaking, and insider dealing.

- Another feature of 
Google
 Search is under challenge, just weeks after the company was ordered to implement a right to be forgotten in Europe.
- A Hong Kong court today ruled that local businessman Albert Yeung Sau-sing can sue the company over its Autocomplete function, which makes proactive suggestions when a user starts to type into the search box.
- In the case of the businessman, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Emperor Motion Pictures group, Autocomplete suggested terms such as 'triad', along with the names of individual triad gangs.
- According to the South China Morning Post, Google argued that it couldn't be held responsible for the suggestions made by Autocomplete. It was, it argued, a "mere passive facilitator", with its algorithm based on the content of previous searches.
- Not so, said judge Marlene Ng May-ling: the information was "distilled pursuant to artificial intelligence set up by Google Inc themselves by virtue of the algorithms they have created and maintained to actively facilitate the search processes." In other words, the algorithms didn't spring into being from nowhere.
- It's not the first time Google has found itself in court over Autocomplete. Back in 2012, it was ordered to remove individual suggestions relating to a Japanese man that linked him to a series of crimes. A year earlier, an Italian court ordered the company to strike Autocomplete suggestions linking a man's name to the terms 'con man' and 'fraud'. And last May, a German court made a similar order over the suggestions 'Scientology' and 'fraud'.
- This latest case, though, represents particularly bad timing for Google. The recent decision by the EU to give its citizens a 'right to be forgotten' means that the company's practices are under more scrutiny than ever before. Reputation management companies are touting aggressively for business, and getting it: Google says it's had more than 90,000 right-to-be-forgotten requests already.
- All this means that consumers, particularly in Europe, are now aware that they do have a say in how Google presents them online. We may well see a lot more in the way of lawsuits over Autocomplete too.
- As so often before, the company claimed in the Hong Kong court that "the entire basis of the internet [would be] compromised" if it had to audit suggestions individually. That statement's a lot harder to justify, though, now that the company's created a mechanism for handling right-to-be-forgotten requests.
- Whether you like the right to be forgotten or not (and personally, I don't), a precedent has certainly been set. Most of the lawsuits Google's had so far over Autocomplete could be argued to involve 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' information - the expression used in the right-to-be-forgotten legislation.
- There's no earthly reason why Google shouldn't set up a similar complaints process for Autocomplete; nor why the EU shouldn't decide to order it to. It would reinforce the trend towards expecting the company to see users as individuals, rather than one great mass, and to respect those individuals' privacy.
- The internet isn't compromised by the Hong Kong court's decision, as Google claims - but its set of business assumptions may be.

- Searches for Emperor Group chief Albert Yeung’s name yield references to triad organized crime gangs in autocomplete.

- A court in Hong Kong has ruled that tycoon Albert Yeung, head of the conglomerate that owns Emperor Motion Pictures, can sue Google for defamation because an autocomplete in searches for his name suggests adding the word “triad,” the territory’s notorious organized crime gangs.
- When searching in English for Albert Yeung Sau-shing, the founder and chairman of Emperor Group, which owns property and jewelry firms as well as the film company, the searches automatically suggest “triad” as the second option.
- 
- In Chinese, the autocomplete function also offers “Sun Yee On” and “14K,” which are the names of prominent triad gangs.

- Yeung wants Google to be made to remove the “defamatory” suggestions and to pay him compensation.
- EMP is one of Hong Kong’s three biggest film companies, and it recently opened the first of a chain of multiplex cinemas. Among its recent hits is Dante Lam’s The Demon Within, and it is also backing Jiang Wen’s Gone With the Bullets, the follow-up to the hugely successful Let the Bullets Fly.
- Hong Kong’s High Court has dismissed the search giant’s argument that it did not bear responsibility for suggestions in the autocomplete function related to Yeung and that the court did not have personal jurisdiction over the U.S. search giant, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported.
- “There is a good arguable case that Google Inc is the publisher of the Words and liable for their publication,” said Marlene Ng, the deputy high court judge, in her ruling.
- “The advantages of having easy access to a rich store of information…[come] at a price; any risk of misinformation can spread easily as users forage in the web…. The art is to find the comfortable equilibrium in between,” Ng said.
- Google argued that autocomplete works according to an automated algorithm and the company is not responsible for the resulting suggestions, which change depending on what a critical mass of users search for.
- Google’s lawyer Gerard McCoy warned that “the entire basis of the Internet will be compromised” if search engines were required to “audit” what could be accessed by Internet users.
- This is a regular problem for Google. In May, the European Union’s highest court, the European Court of Justice, ruled that people have a right to request that years-old personal information that is no longer relevant be removed from Internet search results, the so-called right to be forgotten.
- 
- Yeung is one of Hong Kong’s richest businesspeople and a larger- than-life figure behind top stars, including Nicholas Tse, Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi, but he makes rare forays into the public arena.
- In 1981, he spent nine months in prison after he was found guilty of obstructing justice in a personal injury case, and he survived a kidnapping attempt in 1989. In 1994, he was picked up by the Organized Crime and Triad Bureau (OCTB) but was acquitted.

- A court has ruled that a Hong Kong tycoon can sue Google over its autocomplete results suggesting he has links to organized crime.
- In a judgment released Wednesday, the court dismissed the internet search giant's objections to tycoon Albert Yeung's defamation lawsuit.
- Yeung filed the lawsuit after Google refused to remove autocomplete suggestions such as "triad," as organized crime gangs are known in China, which popped up with searches on his name.
- The billionaire's business empire includes an entertainment company that produces films and manages some of the city's biggest celebrities. He argues that his reputation has been "gravely injured" and wants compensation.
- Judge Marlene Ng disagreed with Google's lawyers, who argued Yeung was better off asking the websites where the defamatory information was published to remove it. She said Google had the ability to censor material.
- "Any risk of misinformation can spread easily as users forage in the web. The art is to find the comfortable equilibrium in between," she said in her ruling.
- It's the latest legal headache for Google over its search service. Earlier this year, the European Union's top court ruled that Google and other search engines must respond to requests seeking removal of links to personal information.
- Last year, a German court ruled in favour of a nutritional supplements company and its owner who sued Google to remove autocomplete terms suggesting links to Scientology and fraud.
- Justin Davidson, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said that while the Hong Kong defamation case has yet to go to trial, "the principle at stake here could have important ramifications for how Google may need to adapt more pro-actively its search engine in future."
- He said that would be akin to changes happening in Europe with fast growth in "right to forget" requests that Google and other search engines are now receiving.
- A Google spokesman declined to comment.
