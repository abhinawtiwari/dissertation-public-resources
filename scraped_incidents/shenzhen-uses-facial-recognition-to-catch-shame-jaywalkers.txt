- Authorities in Shenzhen, China, have launched CCTV cameras incorporating facial recognition and artificial intelligence linked to a database in a bid to crack down on jaywalking, traffic violations, and other crimes.
- Built by local technology company IntelliFusion, the DeepEye system captures images of people illegally crossing the road, identifies the citizen against a database and displays their photo alongside their family name and part of their government identification number on a roadside LED screen and government website.
- According to a Shenzhen government official, 'a combination of technology and psychology… can greatly reduce instances of jaywalking and will prevent repeat offences.'
- The move has prompted some locals and commentators to express their concerns about the intrusivess of the system, and its potential for deepening and expanding state surveillance.
- Local media report that jaywalking and other crimes added to the system also potentially damage one's score in China's 'social credit system'.

- Police in an eastern Chinese city are using the country's social credit system to punish people who jaywalk.
- Under a new legislation that took effect in Nanjing city, Jiangsu province on Monday, pedestrians caught jaywalking more than five times in a year will be classified as 'untrustworthy' and would have their social credit score lowered.
- Traffic police last Monday started using surveillance cameras equipped with facial recognition technology to identify traffic offenders at six major intersections of the city.
- In a week, the system recorded more than 2,700 people crossing the street when the lights are red, according to the Nanjing Municipal Public Security Bureau in a notice on its website.
- Under a new legislation that took effect in Nanjing, Jiangsu province on Monday, pedestrians caught jaywalking more than five times in a year will be classified as 'untrustworthy' and would have their social credit score lowered. Above, people seen jaywalking in Beijing
- Drivers of non-motorised vehicles that occupy the fast lane or travel in the opposite direction could also face a downgrade to their social credit score, it added.
- Once the system detects a person jaywalking, a signal is sent to the surveillance camera to start recording, officer Mao Hanqi of the city's traffic management bureau was quoted as saying.
- Stills from the footage are then checked against the national identity database to identify a match.
- A photo of the individual would then be projected onto a large screen at the crossing while a text message would be sent to the person's phone notifying him or her of the offence.
- Even individuals wearing helmets, sunglasses and face masks can be accurately recognised, he added. Those found guilty of jaywalking would be fined up to 50 yuan (£5.80).

- The new rule sparked controversy on social media, with many net users calling it an abuse of the social credit system. Others supported the legislation.
- Last week, 'Nanjing targets jaywalking in social credit system' was one of the most viewed topics on Weibo, with more than 200 million clicks.
- 'What does jaywalking have to do with being trustworthy or not?' one person said.
- 'This has crossed the line, everything is related to the social credit score now,' another user said.
- 'What gives you the right to include the offence into the social credit system?' one user questioned. 'Where does the facial recognition data come from? Who is responsible for protecting people's privacy?'
- 'This teaches people to respect traffic rules and guarantees their personal safety,' one supporter commented.
- 'This should be implemented across the country!' one comment 'liked' more than 4,400 times read.
- Cameras operating 24-hours will capture an offender's face and send it to display screens, as well as the police bureau, where using face-recognition technology is used to identify the person
- People's Daily said on its Weibo account that Nanjing's move will be effective once implemented, but the government should prioritise solving the root cause of such offences rather than handing out punishment.
- China's has been building a social credit system that assesses its 1.4 billion citizens based on their daily behaviour.
- As of March, 13.49 million individuals in China have been classified as untrustworthy, according to data released by the National Development and Reform Commission.
- Authorities have blocked more than 20.47 million attempts to buy plane tickets and more than 5.71 million attempts to buy high-speed train tickets from these 'discredited individuals', according to the NDRC at a press conference in April.

- With a tagline of 'once discredited, everywhere restricted', China's government-led social credit system vows to punish 'untrustworthy' citizens in as many ways as possible.
- The system, which Beijing aims to complete by 2020 after being unveiled in 2014, will assess individuals, enterprises and government agencies on credit in four areas - administrative affairs, commercial activities, social behavior, and the judicial system, according to an outline issued by the State Council in 2014 cited by Global Times.
- Uncivilised behaviour such as failing to pay municipal parking fees, eating on the train, and frequently changing jobs with 'malicious intent' are some of the new offences that could land people in trouble, the report said.
- Train passengers could face travel bans if they endanger railway safety, smoke on high-speed trains, sell on tickets, produce fake tickets, dodge tickets and occupy unassigned seats, according to People's Daily.
- 'China's ongoing construction of the world's largest social credit system will help the country restore social trust,' state-run tabloid Global Times said in a previous report (file photo)
- Air passengers could be banned from future flights for behaviours including spreading rumours about terror attacks, breaking into runways, assaulting the crew and causing disruption on flights.
- Other individuals with low ratings would be barred from buying premium insurance, wealth management products or real estate, and their personal information would also be listed in public.
- The Global Times also waved off concerns about privacy and authoritarianism by arguing that Western minds were too 'ignorant' to understand the benefits of the system.
- 'Chinese experts said how China, with a population of 1.4 billion people, processes the huge volumes of data is beyond the understanding of Western countries,' the article read. 'The hypothetical theories of the West are based on their ignorance, Chinese experts say.'
- China has been aiming to build the world's most powerful facial recognition system.
- The cutting-edge network aims to identify any one of its 1.4 billion citizens within three seconds.
- The project was launched by the Ministry of Public Security in 2015. It is under development in collaboration with a security company based in Shanghai.
- As of last year, China has installed over 200 million security cameras across the nation.

- In China, law enforcement agencies have been using advanced biometric technology to track citizens for years. These technologies are part of a coordinated national effort to create the “omnipresent, completely connected always on and fully controllable” video surveillance network envisioned by the Chinese Ministry of Public Security in 2015.
- Emblematic of this unprecedented surveillance apparatus are the facial recognition devices deployed in Shenzhen last April that are meant to deter jaywalkers. These devices take photos of offenders and display them on large LED screens above the intersection, along with their name and part of their government ID number. (There is also a website showing photos and information for jaywalkers in Shenzhen.)
- Now Intellifusion, the Chinese artificial intelligence company behind these devices, is taking them a step further by partnering with mobile carriers and social media platforms such as WeChat and Sina Weibo to send text messages directly to offenders as soon as they are caught jaywalking by the cameras.
- A government website catalogs photos of jaywalkers with their personal information using images captured by a facial recognition camera in Shenzhen. Screenshot: ctn.gov.cn
- According to the South China Morning Post, this update to the Shenzhen system is meant to preclude the need to build more of the expensive LED screens in the city. The text message to offenders will include a warning as well as information about the fine for violating the city’s jaywalking rules. Motherboard was unable to determine when these changes will go into effect.
- Since implementing the devices, Chinese traffic police have identified nearly 14,000 jaywalkers at a single Shenzhen intersection alone, according to the South China Morning Post. Moreover, Chinese officials claim that the devices have lowered the number of jaywalkers in the city.
- China plans to roll out a national social credit system by 2020, which will keep a record of citizens’ violation of laws and directly affect their ability to do things like get a loan or get hired for a job. According to the South China Morning Post, devices like the jaywalking facial recognition system will be part of this network to keep track of the number of jaywalking violations and change a person’s social credit score accordingly.

- Even in a country with as many surveillance cameras as the US, Intellifusion’s public facial recognition technology is unsettling. Still, it is hardly the most cutting edge biometric tech deployed by law enforcement in China. Police have already started using glasses that can recognize the faces of wanted criminals and police officers in Beijing have started testing out 720-degree facial recognition body cameras.

- Chinese authorities use facial recognition, public shaming to crack down on jaywalking, criminals
- In the southern city of Shenzhen, Chinese authorities have launched a new surveillance system loaded with facial recognition, artificial intelligence, and a big database to crack down on jaywalking as well as other crimes.
- As a result, photographs of pedestrians caught in the act, along with their names and social identification numbers, are now instantly displayed on LED screens installed at Shenzhen road junctions.
- At some crosswalks, a brake-sounding alarm even goes off if someone walks when the pedestrian light is red, reportedly to alarm the jaywalkers and capture their photo in a moment of panic.
- The Shenzhen police have also launched a public website to name and shame offenders — in just six months at only one road junction in Shenzhen, the new system has already snapped 13,930 jaywalking offenders.
- The technology is also used by the authority to find missing family members, apprehending fugitives, and identify forged documents.
- Similar systems have been in place in other major Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, but the latest deployment in Shenzhen has some citizens and observers worried the digital surveillance systems are reaching a point of violating personal privacy.
- "Despite how obnoxious jaywalking is, there is no legal basis for the police to publish people's identifying information," William Long, a famous Shenzhen tech blogger tweeted.
- "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever," another Twitter user wrote, a reference to George Orwell's novel 1984.
- According to Chinese state media, once someone has been recorded into the system, jaywalking and other petty crimes also potentially damage one's score in the country's reported "social credit system".
- The ambitious initiative reportedly proposes a system by which it can "rate" the trustworthiness of citizens with an index, while looking to "purify" Chinese society by awarding the trustworthy and punishing the disobedient by, for example, banning them from public transport.
- But despite this, a survey published by Chinese state media last year showed 80 per cent of pollsters were in favour of using the artificial intelligence cameras to name and shame petty criminals.
- "After having their photos displayed on the massive screens, some offenders would contact the traffic police department and request to have their photos removed," traffic officer Xia Jianshe told state media last year.
- "Some would say that they're willing to pay the fine while promising that they will never run a red light again."
- Alternatively, Mr Xia said, the traffic department can contact the jaywalkers after verifying their identities and retrieving their contact information from the police database.
- Currently keeping a watchful eye on its 1.4 billion population with over 176 million surveillance cameras, by 2020, China is looking to quadruple the number of cameras and build an overreaching surveillance network that is "omnipresent, completely connected, always on and fully controllable", according to the country's National Development and Reform Commission.
- As of February, police in China's Zhengzhou region have launched sunglasses with built-in, facial-recognition technology to track suspects and scan documents.
- Meanwhile, Chinese companies, from tech start-ups like SenseTime and Hikvision, to multinational e-commerce giant Alibaba, are working hand-in-glove with the Chinese Government to build the proposed nationwide surveillance and data-sharing platform.
- Facial recognition has also been used to prevent toilet paper theft in China since last year, which was reportedly a nationwide problem.
- But in addition to managing petty crimes, Human Rights Watch reported last month Chinese authorities were using the technology to monitor ethnic minorities who were deemed a threat to the Communist Party's rule in the country's far west province of Xinjiang.
- "For the first time, we are able to demonstrate that the Chinese Government's use of big data and predictive policing not only blatantly violates privacy rights, but also enables officials to arbitrarily detain people," Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in the report.
- In Australia, authorities have access to an unprecedented level of information about citizens, and privacy concerns over the use of digital surveillance have been on the rise, but observers say the use of surveillance technology can be very different in China and in Australia.
- "We're seeing a lot of advances in the technology and more widespread use of the technology in China," Australian Strategic Policy Institute analyst Fergus Ryan told the ABC.
- "And that is largely to do with a different attitude that the Chinese Government and Chinese citizens have to the use of the technology, and different attitudes towards privacy concerns and whatnot."
- However, he warned different political systems could lead to different outcomes and uses of the technology down the line.
- "Without having an independent judiciary, the Chinese Communist Party is more willing and able to look into the potential to use these technologies," he said.
- "They could be used to try to create a more stable society or reduce the amount of conflicts in society."

- AI-powered billboards that show the faces of offenders and SMS fines are China's answer to jaywalking
- JAYWALKERS in China are to be named, shamed, and slapped with an instant SMS fine.
- And it's all thanks to cutting-edge artificial intelligence.
- In the southeastern city of Shenzhen, police have set up AI-powered boards by crossings.
- If you jaywalk, a CCTV camera will scan your face and flash it up on the huge screens for all to see, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
- If that wasn't embarrassing enough, there are now plans to ping offenders' phones with quick-fire fines as soon as they violate the grim rule.
- The AI company behind the billboards, Intellifusion, is in talks with mobile phone networks and local social media platforms to enforce the new system.
- The firm is reportedly speaking with WeChat – China's all-encompassing messaging app, which locals use for everything from work and personal chat to mobile payments and blogging – and Sina Weibo, the country's answer to Twitter.
- WeChat currently boasts over 1 billion users, compared with China's 1.3 billion population.
- "Jaywalking has always been an issue in China," Wang Jun, Intellifusion's director of marketing solutions, told SCMP. "A combination of technology and psychology … can greatly reduce instances of jaywalking and will prevent repeat offences."
- In the 10 months to February this year, a whopping 13,930 jaywalkers had their mugs displayed on the screen at one busy crossing, the Shenzhen police announced last month.
- The move is part of a bigger surveillance push in China to track local citizens.
- And it's being powered by a network of 170 million CCTV cameras, many of which are fitted with AI, including face-recognition tech.
- These security cams are already being used to regulate traffic and pinpoint driver's who break the rules.
- An estimated 400 million more security cams will be installed in the next three years, according to a recent BBC report.

- Authorities in Shenzhen city already use giant screens to name and shame pedestrians who violate road rules
- Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile
- Traffic police in China are to begin using facial-recognition technology to identify jaywalkers and automatically issue them fines by text.
- Authorities in Shenzhen already publicly name and shame people who flout the southern city’s strict road rules, using CCTV cameras equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) that can recognise offenders.
- Their faces are then displayed on large screens at crossings and on a government website.
- Now, the company which provides the technology is in talks with mobile phone carriers and social media firms about developing a system that notifies jaywalkers through instant messages when they are caught by the cameras, crossing the road outside of a marked pedestrian crosswalk at an intersection.
- “Jaywalking has always been an issue in China and can hardly be resolved just by imposing fines or taking photos of the offenders,” Wang Jun, director of marketing solutions at Shenzhen-based AI firm Intellifusion, told the South China Morning Post.
- “But a combination of technology and psychology… can greatly reduce instances of jaywalking and will prevent repeat offences."
- Shenzhen began using AI-enabled cameras in April last year and had within 10 months had displayed the 13,939 jaywalking offenders in one LED scree at a busy junction in Futian district, according to police.
- The system uses 7-megapixel cameras and facial-recognition technology to identity pedestrians a database. A photo of the offence, the offender’s family name, and part of their government identification number is displayed on the screen.

- This month authorities also launched a website which naming and shaming jaywalkers with the same information.
- While the measures are said to have reduced the number of repeat offenders, Mr Wang said the next step of issuing fines through text could eliminate the need to install costly LED screens across cities.
- His company is in talks with Chinese social media platforms WeChat and Weibo about the system.
- The technology will also register the number of times someone has violated traffic rules and affect their credit rating if it reaches a set limit.
- Facial-recognition software is also used to identify drivers who violate road rules in Beijing and Shanghai, while at Henan province’s Zhengzhou East rail station police officers have been equipped with smart glasses that can spot wanted criminals.

- As opposed to simply displaying information on giant LED screens as happens now.
- The southern Chinese city of Shenzhen is exploring a system where, through the use of surveillance cameras and AI-based facial recognition, jaywalkers get text messages notifying them of their violation and fining them as soon as they break the law. This, as opposed to current systems which identify a jaywalker and display their likeness on a large LED screen near the intersection.
- “Jaywalking has always been an issue in China and can hardly be resolved just by imposing fines or taking photos of the offenders. But a combination of technology and psychology … can greatly reduce instances of jaywalking and will prevent repeat offenses,” says Wang Jun, director of marketing solutions for the AI company Intellifusion, which is spearheading the invasive endeavor.
- The power of AI-driven facial recognition has become increasingly clear of late, with demonstrations that show how the tech could essentially obliterate privacy and some early applications in retail spaces like Amazon's new automated convenience stores. The U.S. government, of course, is getting in on the action as well, though reports indicate its tech is not especially accurate.
- In China, the jaywalking system is aided by the fact that every person in Shenzhen is legally required to have their information registered with the police after 30 days in the city. Intellifusion is upping the ante by lobbying for access to local mobile phone carriers and popular Chinese social media platforms like WeChat, Sina, and Weibo so it can send citations directly to jaywalkers phones, a move that would reduce the need for expensive displays. While that's far more extreme than anything currently done in the United States, police officers do routinely post the names and faces of suspects who have not been convicted of any crime to Facebook.
- The implications are obviously Orwellian, but the Chinese government asserts the system is at least effective. Before the facial recognition technology was implemented the city was facing 200,000 jaywalking violations within 18 months, and Intellifusion says in the seven intersections in which it placed cameras for a trial run, jaywalking has been reduced by 80 percent.
- The cost, of course, is privacy in spades. Once these sorts of systems are in place, there's no telling what sort of purposes they might eventually be turned to.
