- Eyewear retailer Eyebobs has settled with a customer who had sued the company for failing to provide users of its website with screen readers of equal access to its services, and for misleading marketing.
- The software was supplied by Israel-based web accessibility start-up AccessiBe, which claims to make websites for people with disabilities easier to use by providing an 'automated, state-of-the-art AI technology'.
- Over 600 blind people, accessibility advocates and software developers had previously signed an open letter calling on website operators to stop using AccessiBe and similar companies.

- Overlays are a broad term for technologies that aim to improve the accessibility of a website. They apply third-party source code (typically JavaScript) to make improvements to the front-end code of the website.
- Website add-on products claiming to improve accessibility go back to the late 1990s with products like Readspeaker
      and Browsealoud. They added text-to-speech capabilities to the website(s) on which they were installed.
- Then similar products came to market that added more tools to their software. These allow user-based control of things like font-sizes and colors to improve readability.
- Some newer overlay products aim to fix any problems in the site's code that are preventing assistive technology from being used easily. They apply a script to the page which scans the code and automatically attempts to repair the problem.
- Some examples of web accessibility overlays (by alphabetical order):
- *: denotes that these products are no longer developed or marketed.
- Overlay products are sometimes white labelled (sold under other names), or re-branded for certain markets, so this is not a complete list of the type of products discussed on this page.
- Overlay widgets are unnecessary and are poorly placed in the technology stack.
- As stated above, some overlay products contain widgets which present a
      series of controls that modify the presentation of the page they're on.
      Depending on the product, those changes may do things like change the page
      contrast, enlarge the size of the page's text, or perform other changes to
      the page that are intended to improve the experience for users with
      disabilities.
- To laypersons, these features may seem beneficial, but their practical
      value is largely overstated because the end users that these features claim
      to serve will already have the necessary features on their computer, either
      as a built-in feature or as an additional piece of software that the user
      needs to access not only the Web but all software.
- On this latter point, it is a mistake to believe that the features
      provided by the overlay widget will be of much use by end users because if
      those features were necessary to use the website, they'd be
      needed for all websites that the user interacts with. Instead, the widget is 
      —at best—redundant functionality with what the user already has.
- While some automated repair is possible, customers should be
      discouraged from using an overlay as a long-term solution.
- Some overlay products have capabilities aimed at providing accessibility
      repairs to the underlying page on which the overlay is added. These repairs
      are applied when the page loads in the user's browser.
- While it is true that a non-trivial array of accessibility problems can be
      repaired in this manner, the nature, extent, and accuracy of such repair are
      limited by a number of important factors:
- In addition to the above, overlays do not repair content in Flash, Java,
      Silverlight, PDF, HTML5 Canvas, SVG, or media files.
- While the use of an overlay may improve
      compliance with a handful of provisions in major accessibility standards,
      full compliance cannot be achieved with an overlay.
- Among the many claims made by overlay vendors is the claim that the use of
      their product will bring the site into compliance with accessibility
      standards such as WCAG 2.x, related and derivative standards, and laws that
      mandate compliance with those standards.
- Given that conformance is defined as meeting all
      requirements of the standard, these products' documented inability to repair
      all possible issues means that they cannot bring a website into compliance.
      Products marketed with such claims should be viewed with significant
      skepticism.
- Adding an overlay to your site may run counter to end users' preference for privacy and may create risk of noncompliance with GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA, et al.
- Overlays that automatically enable certain settings, like those for screen reader or speech recognition users, do
      so by detecting when an assistive technology is running on the device. This exposes the fact that the person using
      the device at the time has a disability. In certain cases, like screen reader users where the majority are blind
      or have low vision, it exposes even more detail about the nature of their disability. Like age, ethnic background,
      or preferred gender, disability is sensitive personal information. It is not data that should be collected without
      the informed consent of the person it belongs to.
- Some overlays have been found to persist users' settings across sites which use the same overlay. This is done by
      setting a cookie on the user's computer. When the user enables a setting for an overlay feature on one site, the
      overlay will automatically turn on that feature on other sites. While the overlay company might think they're
      doing good by the end user, the big privacy problem is that the user never opted in to be tracked and there's also no
      ability to opt-out. Due to this lack of an opt-out (other than explicitly turning off that setting) this creates
      General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) risk for the overlay customer.
- Many users with disabilities have expressed strong words of
        dissatisfaction with overlay products. As shown below, overlays
        themselves may have accessibility problems significant enough for users
        to take steps to actively block overlays from appearing at all.
- Please note: while this section may mention specific vendors, these
        comments are par-for-the-course when it comes to the user experience
        provided by overlay widgets which have, in themselves, a pattern of
        negatively impacting the user experience.
- No overlay product on the market can cause a website to become fully
      compliant with any existing accessibility standard and therefore cannot
      eliminate legal risk.
- Accessibility on the Web is a big challenge, both for owners of websites
      and for the users of those websites. The invention of novel approaches to
      resolving this challenge is to be commended.
- However, in the case of overlays—especially those which attempt to add
      widgets that present assistive features—the challenge is not being met. Even
      more problematic is the deceptive marketing provided by some overlay
      vendors who promise that implementing their product will give their
      customer's sites immediate compliance with laws and standards.
- The ineffectiveness of overlays is something that has broad agreement among
      accessibility practitioners, per the WebAIM
        Survey of Web Accessibility Practitioners
      which found:
- As a result of the above information:
- Some overlay vendors have attempted to frame the overlay factsheet as an effort by their competitors to discredit them.
      Such overlay claims are a textbook case of an attempt to gaslight people to deflect criticism.
- As of today, the signatories to the overlay factsheet include:
- In short, the list of signatories below are people who are experts in this field & have dedicated their professional careers to the
        improvement of accessibility or are end users with disabilities (or both). Discounting the names listed below as "competitors" is both inaccurate and
        misses the point: overlays are not an effective means of ensuring accessibility - a point on which all of the people below agree.
