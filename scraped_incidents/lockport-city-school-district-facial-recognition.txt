- An Office of the New York State Comptroller audit (pdf) has found that the procurement process for the implementation of a facial recognition system for Lockport City School District was not transparent, violated district rules and policy, and failed to comply with New York State General Municipal Law.
- The audit was the result of allegations levelled by local resident Jim Schultz that SN Technologies’ AEGIS system was biased and the bidding process corrupt. The allegations prompted then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to order the suspension and inspection of the system by local authorities in March 2021.
- The audit found the district only allowed one day for bids to be submitted and ruled the procurement process was not as transparent as it should have been. SN Technologies was the only respondent.
- Lockport City School District claims Aegis provides early warning signs of threats to students and employees at its schools.The system is also meant to identify guns and alert security to their presence.

- LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) — A New York school district has finished installing a facial recognition system intended to spot potentially dangerous intruders, but state officials concerned about privacy say they want to know more before the technology is put into use.
- Education Department spokeswoman Emily DeSantis said Monday that department employees plan to meet with Lockport City School officials about the system being tested this week. In the meantime, she said, the district has said it will not use facial recognition software while it checks other components of the system.
- The rapidly developing technology has made its way into airports, motor vehicle departments, stores and stadiums, but is so far rare in public schools.
- Lockport is preparing to bring its system online as cities elsewhere are considering reining in the technology’s use. San Francisco in May became the first U.S. city to ban its use by police and other city departments and Oakland is among others considering similar legislation.
- A bill by Democrat Assembly Member Monica Wallace would create a one-year moratorium on the technology’s use in New York schools to allow lawmakers time to review it and draft regulations. The legislation is pending.
- Lockport Superintendent Michelle Bradley, on the district’s website, said the district’s initial implementation of the system this week will include adjusting cameras mounted throughout the buildings and training staff members who will monitor them from a room in the high school.  The system is expected to be fully online on Sept. 1.
- “Much to our dismay, school shootings continue to occur in our country,” wrote Bradley who did not respond to email and telephone messages Monday. “In many cases, these shootings involve students connected to the schools where these horrific incidents occur.”
- The $1.4 million Canadian-made Aegis system, funded through a state technology bond, is designed to enable security officers to quickly respond to the appearance of expelled students, disgruntled employees, sex offenders or certain weapons the system is programmed to detect.
- Only students seen as threats will be loaded into the database. Administrators have said it could thwart shootings like the February 2018 attack in which expelled student Nikolas Cruz is charged with killing 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
- “This would have identified (Cruz) as not being able to be in that building,” Tony Olivo, a security consultant who recommended the system for Lockport, told The Associated Press last year.
- Officials said the district is the first in the country to adopt the Aegis system. But the New York Civil Liberties Union said it has no place in schools.
- “The Lockport School District has barreled ahead with implementing invasive surveillance technology in its schools with little regard for student privacy and civil rights,” education counsel Stefanie Coyle said.

- Ever since they learned that Lockport City School District intended to install a network of facial recognition cameras in its buildings, parents in the upstate New York community—particularly families of color—have worried that the new system will lead to tragic and potentially fatal interactions between their children and police.
- Now, documents newly obtained by Motherboard accentuate those fears. They show that SN Technologies, the Canadian company contracted to install Lockport’s facial recognition system, misled the district about the accuracy of the algorithm it uses and downplayed how often it misidentifies Black faces. The records, comprising hundreds of pages of emails between the district and the company, also detail numerous technical issues with SN Technologies’ AEGIS face and weapons detection system, including its propensity for misidentifying objects like broom handles as guns.
- Those false alarms are particularly concerning to parents. According to local media reports and documents obtained by Motherboard, when it was initially piloted, the system had automatic alerts when it detected weapons or certain people on the district’s “hot list.” The documents show its alert system evolved over time, and SN Technologies says there is a human in the loop at all times: "Our system has been designed and developed with safeguards to protect any false detection whereby a human must verify each individual alert before any alert is confirmed," the company told Motherboard after publication of this article.
- “The police have said if they get a notification they’re going to treat it as a live shooter system, and you have a system that’s predisposed to make mistakes and misidentify people,” Jim Shultz, a Lockport parent, told Motherboard. “The risk of an accident, the risk of something horrible happening because the system is structured the way it is, to me, is 1 million times higher than [the chance] that the cameras are going to prevent a real situation.”
- Lockport schools are 11 percent Black, and Renee Cheatham, a Lockport school board member and parent, told Motherboard that the thought of biased facial recognition triggering an armed police response has outraged Black parents and led to a “very, very dark time.” Both Shultz and Cheatham are plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the New York State Education Department (NYSED) seeking to ban the use of facial recognition in schools.
- The Lockport school district and local police department did not respond to repeated requests for comment. SN Technologies did not respond to repeated requests for comment before publication, but sent a letter to Motherboard after publication with further information about its technology.
- Lockport turned on the AEGIS facial recognition system in January, after several years of battling with parents, civil liberties groups, and the NYSED, which initially opposed the system before abruptly signing off on it in November 2019. At the time, Lockport was the first district in the state seeking to use facial recognition technology in its buildings.
- In the months immediately before NYSED’s decision, Lockport officials received a series of warnings that SN Technologies was misrepresenting a crucial aspect of the AEGIS system.
- In August 2019, KC Flynn, the company’s CEO, sent district officials a lengthy email discussing AEGIS’s overall accuracy and its rate of racial bias. He claimed that SN Technologies was licensing its algorithm from the French firm id3 Technologies, and that this particular algorithm had ranked 49th out of 139 in racial bias tests performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The NIST tests demonstrated that all facial recognition algorithms perform worse on people of color.
- But according to Patrick Grother, the NIST scientist who oversaw the testing, the agency never tested an id3 Technologies algorithm that matches the description Flynn gave Lockport officials. “Those numbers don’t tally with our numbers. They’re not even close. What id3 sent to NIST is not what these people are talking about,” Grother told Motherboard.
- Furthermore, he described Flynn’s statements about how facial recognition accuracy is calculated as “completely nonsensical.” And Grother said he warned a lawyer representing Lockport about all those issues when they first shared Flynn’s email with him in 2019.
- The district received even more evidence that SN Technologies was lying in October, when it received a report from Freed Maxick, the accountancy it had hired to audit SN Technologies’ claims. The auditors wrote that the company had inaccurately claimed that, in NIST testing, its algorithm misidentified Black men twice as often as white men and misidentified Black women 10 times more often than white men. In reality, the auditors wrote, NIST tests of the id3 Technologies algorithm that Flynn’s company claimed to be using actually showed that it misidentified Black men four times more often and Black women 16 times more often than white men.
- Motherboard obtained a copy of the Freed Maxick report from the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), which is representing the Lockport parents in their lawsuit.
- A screenshot from an audit of the software shows rates of misidentification in Black students are much higher than what the company claims
- SN Technologies claims that it never misled Lockport: "Our relationship with the Lockport City School District over the last 4 years has been based on trust and transparency and all of our correspondence and communications is on the public record. The selection and adoption of the AEGIS system has been the subject of public meetings, discussions with various groups and published in local media outlets over the last 4 years," KC Flynn, president and CEO of the company, wrote in a letter to Motherboard. "I would like to categorically state, that SN Technologies Corp has never lied or misled the Lockport City School District including how our technology functions or the expected outcomes it provides."
- Flynn also said " It is not uncommon for Facial Recognition algorithms to have differences in accuracy based on race and gender. Our AEGIS system performs at an accuracy level greater than 99.9% regardless of race or gender of an individual, as verified by the independent report conducted by Freed Maxick, one of the Top 100 CPA firms in the United States."
- Flynn said that the company paid for the Freed Maxick review but was not involved in it: "SN Technologies is an expert, software development company. When the Lockport City School District asked us to provide feedback on the NIST report and our software, we provided our interpretation of the reported information and suggested that a third-party expert review and assess all the data and provide an independent report to the school district. As is the standard for these types of reviews, SN Technologies paid for the review but had no involvement in the review or the final assessment."It is unclear whether the AEGIS system has ever prevented an incident in Lockport’s schools, or whether police have ever responded to the schools as a result of a false alert. The district and the police department did not respond to requests for that data.
- The emails Motherboard obtained through Freedom of Information Law requests show that in the short time the weapons detection aspect of AEGIS has been active, it has regularly misidentified objects as guns and has had to be recalibrated several times.
- In one email sent to Lockport school administrators earlier this year, an SN Technologies representative says the company is training the system to recognize broom handles in an attempt to stop it from mistaking them for weapons. The following month, the system was still returning a series of false gun alerts.
- Emails showing a series of false alerts as the system misidentifies broom handles as guns
- Flynn said the system has been repeatedly tweaked since it was originally piloted: "Adjustments also had to be made after construction and renovations at the Lockport High School early in 2020, as the construction disturbed cameras and their connections to the AEGIS system. Once the install and settings were complete the system was fully functioning. It is our understanding from feedback we have received from the school district, that the gun detection tool is living up to expectations."
- Shultz, one of the Lockport parents, said the sad irony of the situation is that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, facial recognition has been rendered useless because everyone entering schools must wear a mask. Meanwhile, other districts in the state used their Smart Schools money to pay for upgrades like new laptops and improved internet connectivity that are now even more vital to students’ success.
- Lockport’s pursuit of facial recognition drew national attention to the district and prompted the New York legislature to pass a bill that would ban the use of facial recognition in schools until a comprehensive study of its effect on students can be completed. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has yet to sign that bill, but state Sen. Brian Kavanagh told Motherboard that he has spoken to the governor’s office and expects it to become law this year.
- But despite the legislation, the lawsuits, the media coverage, and local backlash in Lockport, other districts in New York have followed suit and are seeking state money for facial recognition systems of their own.
- At least 11 other districts in the state have since applied for Smart Schools money to purchase facial recognition systems, according to a NYCLU analysis of the applications. Schools in other states, such as South Carolina, have also deployed similar systems which claim the ability to detect weapons and stop school shootings.
- “There are other districts that are trying to get their hands on similar technology without the safeguards that should be in place,” Stefanie Coyle, the NYCLU lawyer leading the Lockport lawsuit, told Motherboard. “These tools are not the right way to go … [but] We now have companies that are targeting districts across the state.”

- UPDATE: The New York State Education Department has instructed Lockport to delay its use of facial recognition technology.
- BuzzFeed News Reporter
- Update: On Thursday, the New York State Education Department told BuzzFeed News it has asked Lockport to delay its use of facial recognition technology on students. The full statement is below.
- Next week, a school district in western New York will become the first in the United States to pilot a facial recognition system on its students and faculty. On Monday, June 3, the Lockport City School District will light up its Aegis system as part of a pilot project that will make it broadly operational by Sept. 1, 2019. The district has eight schools.
- Superintendent Michelle Bradley announced the move on Tuesday, as first reported by The Lockport Union-Sun and Journal. Bradley described the test as an “initial implementation phase" meant to troubleshoot the system, train district officials on its use, and discuss proper procedures with local law enforcement in the event of an alert triggered by the facial recognition tech.
- The Lockport pilot comes amid increased scrutiny of facial recognition’s efficacy across the US, including growing civil rights concerns and worries that the tech may serve to further entrench societal biases. Earlier this month, San Francisco banned police from using facial recognition, and similar bills in the US hope to do the same. Amazon has endured persistent pressure — including from its own shareholders — for its aggressive salesmanship of its facial Rekognition system to law enforcement agencies. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez expressed concern that facial recognition could be used as a form of social control in a congressional hearing on the technology last week.
- At the same time, reports and studies of facial recognition’s inaccuracies and mistakes — especially on women and people of color — continue to emerge.
- Other schools have considered implementing facial recognition systems, but Lockport will be the first public school district to begin using the tech, the American Civil Liberties Union told BuzzFeed News.
- BuzzFeed News has reached out to the Lockport City School District and the maker of the Aegis system for comment.
- Do you work for a company developing or using facial recognition or biometric tech? Did you used to? We'd love to hear from you. You can contact BuzzFeed News securely on Signal at +1-646-379-1975 or email us at tips@buzzfeed.com.
- Lockport resident Jim Shultz, a vocal critic of the school district’s plan to use facial recognition, described the upcoming pilot as “a dicey move”: “I think the district is desperate not to begin another school year with their expensive system just sitting there,” he told BuzzFeed News.
- In March 2018, Lockport announced its plans to install a facial recognition security system, which it funded through the New York Smart Schools Bond Act — an act meant to help state schools augment their instructional tech. But instead of buying laptops and iPads, Lockport submitted a proposal for a high-tech security system, and allocated much of the $4.2 million it was given toward adding dozens of surveillance cameras in the school and installing the facial recognition system Aegis, which is provided by Canada-based SN Technologies. To date, Lockport has spent $1.4 million to get the system up and running.
- “Aegis is an early warning system that informs staff of threats including guns or individuals who have been identified as not allowed in our buildings,” stated an FAQ distributed to the school’s parents and obtained by BuzzFeed News. “Aegis has the ability [to screen] every door and throughout buildings to identify people or guns. Early detection of a threat to our schools allows for a quicker and more effective response.”
- The district's letter to parents makes the case for facial recognition in light of the specter of recurring school shootings. "Much to our dismay, acts of violence in schools continue to occur in our country," it reads. "Please be assured that the Lockport City School District continues to make school security a priority."
- According to the FAQ, Aegis will track individuals who are “level 2 or 3 sex offenders, students who have been suspended from school, staff who have been suspended and/or are on administrative leave, any persons that have been notified that they may not be present on District property, anyone prohibited from entry to District property by court order … or anyone believed to pose a threat based on credible information presented to the District.” The Lockport Journal further reported that the object recognition system will also be able to detect 10 types of guns.
- The video footage will be kept for 60 days, after which it will be erased from the server, the FAQ says. And while it adds that the system “will not generate information on or record the movements of any other district students, staff or visitors,” previous reporting from BuzzFeed News has shown that in order to effectively flag the faces of "persons of interest," facial recognition systems must also disregard the faces of persons who are not of interest. In other words, it analyzes them, too.
- After Lockport’s initial announcement, the New York Civil Liberties Union investigated the effort and wrote letters to the New York State Education Department, asking it to intervene and block the project. “This is opening the floodgates,“ Stefanie Coyle, education counsel for NYCLU, told BuzzFeed News in an interview. “San Francisco banned this tech, and it’s this major city closest to all the people who understand this tech the best. Why in the world would we want this to come to New York, and in a place where there are children?”
- Meanwhile, New York State Assembly Member Monica Wallace has introduced a bill that, if passed, would force Lockport to stop the use of facial recognition for a year while the State Education Department further studied the tech.
- But the NYCLU’s Coyle also pointed out that the New York State Assembly’s legislative session is “almost over” — it comes to a close in June. “We’re running out of time for [this bill] to be passed this session. So if it doesn’t pass this session, there’s nothing that will stop Lockport from implementing this facial recognition system in the fall.” ●
- On Thursday, the New York State Education Department told BuzzFeed News it has asked Lockport to delay its use of facial recognition technology on students. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson said, “The Department is currently reviewing the Lockport CSD’s privacy assessment to ensure that student data will be protected with the addition of the new technology. The Department has not come to the conclusion that the District has demonstrated the necessary framework is in place to protect the privacy of data subjects and properly secure the data. As such, it is the Department’s continued recommendation that the District delay its use of facial recognition technology.Regulations are in the process of being finalized that will adopt a standard for data privacy and security for all state educational agencies. We recommended in past communication that the District consider reviewing the standard and related materials in developing and refining its data security and privacy program. We will remain in contact with school district officials.”As first reported by The Lockport Journal's Connor Hoffman, District Superintendent Michelle Bradley said she made the state education department aware of the district's intentions to activate its facial recognition system earlier this month, but no one from the department responded at the time — so Lockport assumed it could go ahead with its trial run of the technology.

- The Lockport City School District in New York will start testing a facial and object recognition system called "Aegis" on June 3rd. According to BuzzFeed News, that will make it the first in the US to pilot a facial recognition surveillance system on its students and faculty. The district installed cameras and the software suite back in September, using $1.4 million of the $4.2 million funding it received through the New York Smart Schools Bond Act. Funding provided through the Bond Act is supposed to go towards instructional tech devices, such as iPads and laptops, but the district clearly had other plans.
- BuzzFeed News got its hands on a copy of a letter distributed to the students' parents, and it describes Aegis as "an early warning system" that can notify officials of threats. The system, created by Canadian company SN Technologies, can apparently keep track of certain individuals in school grounds. They include level 2 or 3 sex offenders, anyone prohibited from entering the schools and anybody believed to pose a threat based on credible information.
- The system can also identify students and staff who've been suspended, but it's unclear if Lockport will use it to monitor those who've been suspended over non-violent offenses. According to the letter, though, Aegis will delete footage after 60 days and it won't record the movements of students, staff and visitors that aren't in the list of individuals to monitor. That said, the system will have to analyze everyone's faces to identify people it has to keep an eye on.
- In addition to being able to recognize certain individuals, the software was designed to recognize 10 types of guns. The letter even talks about the necessity of a facial recognition system in the context of school shootings. Part of the letter says that while "acts of violence in schools continue to occur in our country," parents can "be assured that the Lockport City School District continues to make school security a priority."
- As you can guess, the pilot test is a controversial one, seeing as the technology is facing more and more scrutiny now that companies are treating information as currency. Facial recognition systems continue to show gender and racial bias, frequently misidentifying women and persons of color. They're far from perfect: In fact, when New York City tested it to spot terrorists on the road in 2018, it failed to detect a single face.
- Stefanie Coyle, education counsel for the New York Civil Liberties Union, told BuzzFeed News that the organization asked the New York State Education Department to block the project. After all, San Francisco banned the technology, and it's a city filled with tech companies that understand it best. "Why in the world would we want this to come to New York," she added, "and in a place where there are children?"
- State Assembly Member Monica Wallace has also introduced a bill that would prohibit the district from using the technology. But if it fails to pass, then Lockport will be able roll it out to all its schools on September 1st. Before that happens, though, district officials have to make any adjustments needed based on Aegis' performance during the pilot period. They'll figure out the best camera angles and lighting during the testing phase and will also train people on how to use the system.

- Plan for cameras to track students in Lockport’s schools called ‘unprecedented invasion of privacy’ and ‘colossal waste of money’
- A school district in western New York is launching a first-of-its-kind facial recognition system, generating new privacy concerns about the powerful but controversial technology.
- The Lockport city school district is beginning implementation of the Aegis facial recognition system this week, officials said, with the technology expected to be fully up and running in time for the new school year in September.
- “Much to our dismay, school shootings continue to occur in our country. In many cases, these shootings involve students connected to the schools where these horrific incidents occur,” superintendent Michelle Bradley said in a message to parents. “The Lockport city school district continues to make school security a priority.”
- The system is designed to detect the faces of people barred from Lockport schools, sex offenders, suspended students and staff members, and others deemed to be a threat, and alert officials if they are found on school grounds. The system can also detect guns, the district says.
- A handful of other school districts around the US have begun to use facial recognition, but Lockport is the first to institute a system of this kind, with cameras throughout the school building rather than just at doors, said Jim Shultz, a Lockport resident whose daughter is a sophomore at the local high school, and the head of the not-for-profit Democracy Center.
- He said the technology would be both ineffective and an invasion of privacy.
- “From a school safety point of view, it’s just a colossal waste of money. The way the system is designed to work is you would have to know in advance who a school shooter would be – you’d have to get their picture and put it in the system, and you’d have to hope they didn’t put on a ski mask or something on the way in,” Shultz told the Guardian. Even then, an alert would be unlikely to stop an attack in time, he said.
- The system, to be used in the district’s eight schools, will place cameras in hallways and throughout school buildings but not in classrooms, which would violate teachers’ contract.
- “It’s an unprecedented invasion of privacy on our students,” Shultz said, adding that students’ movements through hallways and interactions with classmates could be tracked. “That’s an insane thing to make a precondition of getting a high school education.”
- The district says it will not record the movements of students, staff or visitors who are not on the threat list.
- “While it’s controversial, it’s not prohibited and the most important thing is we believe we’ve established boundaries in the use of this,” Bradley told the Lockport Union-Sun & Journal, which first reported plans for the technology. “We have a policy that intends to protect privacy. We have identified a small group of individuals who will be placed in a database.”
- The district did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.
- The system is being paid for with a grant from New York state for technology education, which local districts were also allowed to use for hi-tech security.
- “Every other district used their money for faster broadband and new iPads,” Shultz said. “We’re the only district that did this stupid thing.”

- In February 2018, Nikolas Cruz killed seventeen people in a six-minute shooting spree at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Now, the Lockport City School District in New York is set to become the first public schools in the U.S. to power up facial recognition designed to detect this kind of threat. The consultant who specified the technology claimed it "would have identified [Cruz] as not being able to be in that building," administrators heralded its potential to thwart a "Parkland attack."
- Those campaigning against the system insist it would have done nothing of the sort. "It's a really foolish application of technology to a problem," says Jim Shultz, a local resident and the most vocal opponent of the deployment. "There is no database that’s going to tell you who a school shooter is going be. What does it actually buy you, even if it works? It doesn’t buy you the kind of advanced notice that's going to stop anything."
- Let’s assume Cruz was enrolled in a facial recognition system, and that the stored imagery of him was of good-quality. Let’s assume the system picked him up quickly, and that operators did not dismiss the alert as a potential false positive. Let’s assume those operators did not take time to look up details on Cruz or seek secondary verification, and that armed security guards in the vicinity were well-trained and reacted without hesitation.
- They had 120 seconds from Cruz exiting the Uber to firing his first shot.
- KC Flynn, the President of SN Technologies, the company behind the Aegis technology being deployed, told me that "the technology compares all faces seen throughout the building against a school-built and controlled database that includes only individuals that are not allowed on school premises or that are a known threat to the School District. Students are not included in any database nor are any faces seen by the software stored in the system."
- The Lockport system was announced more than a year ago but stalled when the school district was asked by the state education department to justify its use of a technology funded through the New York Smart Schools Bond Act. Lockport had elected for fancy cameras instead of computer equipment and learning aids.
- "Decisions are being made as to where to deploy artificial intelligence by local school boards," Shultz tells me, "people who are really ill-equipped. So this technology makes no sense at all as a school safety system. It’s a complete misinterpretation of the problem. And this is a tiny district. There are 4,800 students total in this district. And this is a $2.3 million investment."
- Vendors of facial recognition technology are now eyeing the $2.7 billion spent annually on school security in the U.S. alone. As the Washington Post pointed out last year, "an expanding web of largely unknown security contractors is marketing face recognition directly to school and community-center leaders, pitching the technology as an all-seeing shield against school shootings like those at Parkland and Santa Fe.”
- SN Technology's Flynn told me that "cameras are not allowed in any instructional areas, change rooms or bathrooms in NY State schools. Once a prohibited person is identified by the software, it is sent for verification by a designated individual, therefore a person must make the final decision on a match, not the system, if a match is confirmed then the school procedures are followed by staff."
- According to a document shared with school parents, the Aegis system will track "level 2 or 3 sex offenders, students who have been suspended from school, staff who have been suspended and/or are on administrative leave, any persons that have been notified that they may not be present on District property... [or] prohibited from entry to District property by court order... [or] believed to pose a threat based on credible information presented to the District."
- Flynn told me that "the local resident is not aware of how the system works or has been misinformed about the technology... This has not been re-cut from a casino system. The dollar figures quoted in the article are not accurate and Mr. Shultz although invited to see a demonstration on many occasions has chosen not to."
- "It doesn’t solve a problem," Shultz says, "but it creates a whole Pandora’s Box of other problems around privacy...  because of the way it's being deployed. This is not about what people say they’re going to do with the system, it's about what the system has the potential to do. Almost by accident, the consultant who sold the solution explained that the system can go back and create a map of who’s associated with who in the school halls."
- "Our system has been tested by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and operates at an accuracy level of 99.9947%," Flynn responded. "The AEGIS system also includes gun detection. In mass shootings, every second counts and law enforcement officials say that every 4-second delay in a mass shooting costs an additional life. And since our product provides real-time alerts and has been integrated into police software. Finally, the system includes a forensic search engine that allows the historical video to be searched efficiently and without tying up resources."
- The New York State Assembly has been considering a bill that would delay Lockport's deployment by a year, although with only a month to run until the legislative session closes the bill's sponsors are running out of time.
- "The only consultation with the community," Shultz says, "was putting it on the agenda for a school board meeting at 4.30 in the afternoon in August. Trust me no-one goes to a school board meeting at 4.30 in the afternoon in August. And the board minutes show that no comments were offered and that was the basis of their consultation with the community. People think the system is stupid. A lot of the teachers think it's stupid, but they won’t say anything about out as they’re afraid of retribution."
- "I’ve never spoken to a parent that didn’t support our technology, with the exception of Mr. Schultz," Flynn told me.
- A Pew Research Center survey found that 57% of U.S. teens and 63% of their parents worried about a school shooting. "The stupidest things we do as humans are in response to fear," Shultz says, "and nothing makes us more afraid in the U.S. right now than school safety." "Which makes school districts very susceptible to this idea that technology can solve the problem, Shultz says. "And technology is not going to solve this problem. Especially not this technology."
- Facial recognition can help build an early-warning intelligence picture with prevention in mind. Law enforcement agencies at federal, state and local levels have access to watchlists that are not available to schools. A segmented system, with stove-piped data, can monitor for multiple people from different sources simultaneously, alerting the right agency to a match. For example, a school system could monitor against a state law enforcement watchlist without the school having access to the data itself. For an early-warning system to work, or for a real-time system to reduce response times, the data is the key.
- Such data can be linked with behavioral monitoring and early warning tip-offs that are far more likely to prevent attacks. This also means reaching out into the school community, to friends and families, to encourage the reporting of tell-tale signs and concerns. The U.S. Secret Service’s National Threat Assessment Center’s report on enhancing school safety concentrates on prevention and intervention through just such monitoring of behavior and patterns of risk.
- Facial recognition is a hot subject in the U.S. right now. San Francisco has stripped the technology from law enforcement agencies. Amazon is under fire from lawmakers and shareholders for its facial recognition software. Google and Microsoft have pulled back. The irony is that the public should be far more concerned about deploying advanced AI into schools than into the hands of the police. And with vendors making claims and not being held to account, we are entering dangerous territory.
- "Lockport is a cautionary tale about what happens when fears about school safety get exploited by a slick technology salesman," Shultz tells me. "This is a waste of almost $3 million in a district of only 4,800 students. It does nothing to keep our children safer but it does bring Big Brother right into our schools."
- [By way of disclosure, the company I lead sells facial recognition to government agencies and, under limited circumstances, commercial organizations. However, we do not sell facial recognition into the schools market because we do not believe it is an effective solution for the prevention of attacks.]

- An Upstate New York school is using facial recognition technology to help it spot possible school shooters or escaped felons on campus.
- Lockport City School District has installed a surveillance system in a high school, middle school and several elementary schools that scans students' faces to check for matches in its security database.
- The controversial move has attracted pushback from local parents, privacy advocates and some legislators who say it could invade students' privacy.

- Lockport City School District in upstate New York is using controversial facial recognition technology to help it spot possible school shooters or escaped felons on campus
- Each client who chooses to install the system is able to choose which information is loaded into its database.
- They may source the material from local mugshot databases or images of students who've been expelled.
- From there, it scans each face and compares it with the database.
- If there's no match, the system deletes the face it just recorded.
- But if it finds a match, it sends a warning to the control center.
- The district is using a system developed by SN Technologies Corp., the parent company of Aegis, according to Motherboard.
- Aegis has developed proprietary software that can be used to spot guns that might appear in video footage.
- On its website, the firm describes the tech as being able to be used 'to alert school officials if anyone from the local Sex Offenders Registry enters a school or if any suspended students, fired employees, known gang members or an affiliate enters a school.'
- Each client who chooses to install the system, in this case Lockport, is able to choose what information is loaded into its database.
- They may get material from local mugshot databases or use images of former students who are barred from campus.
- To get the system up and running, Lockport is installing or updating about 417 cameras across six elementary schools, one middle school, one high school and one administration building, Motherboard said.
- Lockport City School District is using a system made by SN Technologies Corp., the parent company of Aegis. Pictured is Lockport High School, which is installing several cameras
- The district was awarded $4 million through a state grant to install the system.
- Its grant application details why it decided to move forward with bringing facial recognition tech to several schools across the district.
- According to Motherboard, the application said it wanted funds for 'new cameras and wiring…to provide viewing and automated facial and object recognition of live and recorded surveillance video,' plus 'additional surveillance servers…to provide enhanced storage of recorded video and processing.'
- KC Flynn, head of SN Technologies, told Motherboard that 20 other US school districts were considering moving forward with Aegis' facial recognition technology.
- Once users build a database of potential security threats, the system is set up.
- It scans each face and compares it with the database. If there's no match, the system deletes the face it just recorded, but if it finds a match, it sends a warning to the control center.
- Many say it could give schools a couple extra minutes of much-needed lead time if an unwanted person is on campus - especially if they're armed.
- The system works by scanning each face and comparing it with the database. If there's no match, it deletes the face, but if there's a match the system sends an alert to the control center
- Facial recognition is increasingly used as way to access your money and your devices.
- When it comes to policing, it could soon mean the difference between freedom and imprisonment.
- Faces can be scanned at a distance, generating a code as unique as your fingerprints.
- This is created by measuring the distance between various points, like the width of a person's nose, distance between the eyes and length of the jawline.
- Facial recognition systems check more than 80 points of comparison, known as 'nodal points', combining them to build a person's faceprint.
- These faceprints can then be used to search through a database, matching a suspect to known offenders.
- Facial recognition is increasingly used as way to access your money and your devices. When it comes to policing, it could soon mean the difference between freedom and imprisonment (stock)
- Facial scanning systems used on personal electronic devices function slightly differently, and vary from gadget to gadget.
- The iPhone X, for example, uses Face ID via a 7MP front-facing camera on the handset which has multiple components.
- One of these is a Dot Projector that projects more than 30,000 invisible dots onto your face to map its structure.
- The dot map is then read by an infrared camera and the structure of your face is relayed to the A11 Bionic chip in the iPhone X, where it is turned into a mathematical model.
- The A11 chip then compares your facial structure to the facial scan stored in the iPhone X during the setup process.
- Security cameras use artificial intelligence powered systems that can scan for faces, re-orient, skew and stretch them, before converting them to black-and-white to make facial features easier for computer algorithms to recognise.
- Error rates with facial recognition can be as low as 0.8 per cent. While this sounds low, in the real world that means eight in every 1,000 scans could falsely identify an innocent party..
- One such case, reported in The Intercept, details how Steven Talley was falsely matched to security footage of a bank robber.
- However, critics say the vast number of school shooters are enrolled students, or  people who wouldn't be in the database.
- There's also no evidence of the system leading to safer schools.
- The New York Civil Liberties Union has also raised concerns around how the system could be biased toward people of color on campus.
- Additionally, documents have shown the district didn't engage with the local community before they made the decision to install the system.
- The NCLU also pointed out that, currently, there's no way for the public to access data collected from the cameras, or find out which faces have been fed into the system.

- The Lockport City School District didn't break the law when it awarded a contract for a now-illegal facial recognition security system without competitive bidding, a state audit said Wednesday.
- But the district's tactics, which included allowing only one day to submit hardware proposals in a manner that only one company could have responded to, were not as transparent as they should have been, the State Comptroller's Office said.
- Its audit was announced in March 2021, a month after Jim Shultz, a Lockport parent and staunch critic of the security system, asked for it.
- In a response letter, Superintendent Michelle T. Bradley and Board of Education President Karen Young said the purchase "was in the district's best interests, and was obtained under fair and reasonable terms."
- Previously, the state reimbursed Lockport $4.27 million for the security system, which included about 300 digital cameras to scan the faces of everyone entering district buildings and try to match them to a watch list of sex offenders and other persons banned from the schools.
- District officials also said the cameras could detect weapons, but only if they were visible. The system had no X-ray capability.
- "They spent $2.7 million on facial cameras without ever doing any kind of serious analysis as to whether it was a smart thing to do," Shultz said Wednesday. "They didn't engage in a competitive bidding process, although they they pretended to."
- The audit also criticized Lockport for a lack of competition in professional services contracts and some purchases of goods by "piggybacking" on other districts' contracts. But both practices are allowed by state law.
- "The District is pleased that following your staff's extensive review of aspects of the District's fiscal operations, there was not a single identified instance of financial irregularity," the Bradley-Young letter told the Comptroller's Office.
- The districtwide security system was activated in January 2020. But in December 2020, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed a law banning facial recognition security systems from New York schools.
- Studies of such systems around the world have shown that the technology works well only for adult white males and is more prone to produce false matches when the subjects are females, children or people of color.
- The law prohibits the Education Department from approving any facial recognition system until July 1, 2022, or when it completes a report on the system's impact on civil liberties, whichever is later.
- Lockport's system, now switched off, also was supposed to detect guns being brought into the schools.
- In 2016, the Lockport Board of Education hired a technology consultant, Tony Olivo of Orchard Park, to help it research and select a facial recognition security system.
- The consultant issued a request for information from vendors on June 16, 2016, but responses were due only four days later, the state audit said.
- The consultant told the district that vendors told him they would need time to develop software for such a system, or that the cost would exceed Lockport's budget. However, the audit said, the district had no written proof of that statement.
- In June 2017, the district entered into a facial recognition software licensing agreement for a high school security system, choosing the AEGIS system produced by SN Technologies, an Ontario company. The district wasn't required to seek competitive bids, and it didn't, the audit said.
- At the time, SN Technologies' website listed Olivo's company as a partner firm.
- Two months later, the district issued a request for proposals for hardware for the security system and gave vendors one day to respond. SN Technologies was the only respondent.
- "Seeking competition for the initial facial/object recognition software may have provided for a more transparent procurement process," the auditors wrote.
- The security system was activated at Lockport High School that fall.
- In February 2018, the Board of Education passed a resolution to standardize the software, requiring bidders to use the AEGIS software in bids for security gear at all other Lockport schools. That in effect ruled out all other vendors, said the audit, which called the resolution "inaccurate and misleading" because it said there had been a competitive process to select the software vendor.
- "The District was fully justified in using a standardization approach to the procurement of its enhanced security system, given that the system was already operating in the High School, that District officials were already familiar with and satisfied by its operation, and that further implementing the enhanced security system District-wide was the most efficient and economical approach forward in order to protect the safety of District students, staff and visitors," the Bradley-Young letter said.

- 
- The decision-making behind a face biometrics system purchased by Lockport City School District is under increasingly intense scrutiny, with a critic requesting the Office of the New York State Comptroller investigate the bidding process, according to the Lockport Union-Sun & Journal.
- Local resident Jim Schultz has filed an administrative petition with the Office, requesting it open an investigation into possible violations of its fiduciary responsibility, alleging several problems with the business process. Those include a “financial conflict” in which district security consultant Anthony Olivo held a stake in SNTechnologies, which developed the Aegis system the school board purchased. Schultz also says there was no fair and open competitive bid process, and that district resources were used to investigate him when he began asking questions about the biometric security system.
- Schultz raised the concerns verbally with district officials, and petitioned citizens online, prior to his appeal to the State Comptroller.
- The system was a $3.8 million investment in total, and has resulted in the biometric and gun-detection capabilities being turned on early last year. By the end of the year, however, the district was ordered to turn off the system when the state passed an 18-month moratorium on the technology’s use in schools and ordered a study of its legality and appropriateness.
- With links to Board of Education meetings, documents obtained through Freedom of Information Law processes and other evidence, Schultz alleges the bidding process was a show. He notes the district never released bid information, or an analysis of why it selected SNTechnologies’ facial recognition. The petition suggests a written analysis of the decision may not exist.
- An email exchange between Olivo and a district official is also included as evidence that school district resources were used to investigate Schultz, a contributing writer to the Union-Sun & Journal and area parent.
- “The act of a public school district using school district time and resources to investigate a parent for the offense of asking reasonable questions about a district project is a gross violation of democratic principles,” Shultz states in the petition. “It constitutes a violation of the district’s fiduciary responsibility to spend the public’s resources in a prudent and appropriate manner.”
- Schultz, along with Trustee Renee Cheatham, who joined the board after the biometric system was activated, are named as plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the state education department brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union, aiming to overturn the authorization of the system.

- 
- In a complete 180 from the decision to ban government agencies from using the technology in San Francisco, a Western New York school district wants to use facial recognition as part of a security system for its public schools. The Lockport City School District claims this system, called 'Aegis,' will provide early warning signs of any threats to the people in its schools. But as it set to go into testing next week, the system is now facing a challenge from the New York State Education department.
- In an informative letter sent to parents, and obtained by BuzzFeed News, the school district outlined its goal to prevent the possibility of a school shooting or violence on its grounds. To that end, Aegis will monitor and identify suspicious individuals such as people with weapons, suspended students or staff, and sexual offenders. The system is also expected to identify specific types of guns and alert security to its presence. According to the letter, video footage taken by these cameras will remain in the system for only 60 days before it is deleted.
- The decision to bring facial recognition into an area with children is controversial, to say the least. "It's a really foolish application of technology to a problem," said Jim Shultz to Forbes. As the head of the nonprofit Democracy Center, Shultz believes this is just an expensive waste of funds. Zak Doffman, a cybersecurity contributor for Forbes, seemed to agree, using the Parkland shooting suspect as an example to point out how many 'perfects' must line up to actually catch a potential shooter.
- "They had 120 seconds from [the suspect] exiting the Uber to firing his first shot," Doffman wrote. Not only does the suspect need to have a file in the facial recognition system, his image would have to be high-quality, the operators must accept the alert as-is, no one must double-check the details to verify the alert, and the security guards must react without hesitation.
- To make matters more complicated, facial recognition technology is still notoriously imperfect. Police forces in the United Kingdom have been testing it in public spaces, only to find that 92 percent of the matches were actually wrong, according to the BBC. A lawyer with the civil rights group, Liberty, also added that current studies show a weakness within facial recognition systems in identifying women and darker-skinned faces.
- "If you are a woman or from an ethnic minority and you walk past the camera, you are more likely to be identified as someone on a watch list, even if you are not," said the lawyer, Megan Goulding, to the BBC. "That means you are more likely to be stopped and interrogated by the police."
- According to 2017-2018 enrollment data for the Lockport City School District, most of its 4,470 students are white. This still leaves the female half of the entire student body and almost one-third of racial minority students at risk of being misidentified. This has not gone unnoticed by critics of the new security system.
- "San Francisco banned this tech, and it’s this major city closest to all the people who understand this tech the best," said a counsel for the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU). "Why in the world would we want this to come to New York, and in a place where there are children?"
- So far, Aegis has cost the Lockport City School District $1.4 million to set up. The district will be allocating even more towards the system from a pool of $4.2 million in funding it received that was intended for educational technology to enhance student learning, such as laptops.
- The NYCLU and a New York State Assembly Member have urged the halt of this system until further information is available. Their efforts have been successful so far — in a statement to the Lockport Union-Sun & Journal, the New York State Education Department has ordered the school district to cease its attempts until there are better regulations in place to ensure the security and privacy of the student data obtained by Aegis. For now, the students of the eight schools that make up the Lockport City School District will not have to deal with what was likely an imperfect facial recognition system.
- Testing of the system was supposed to begin on June 3. Aegis was planned to be operational in all district schools by Sept. 1.

URL: https://www.biometricupdate.com/202204/ny-state-audit-finds-bidding-for-school-facial-recognition-system-was-improper
- An audit from the state of New York examining the bidding for implementing facial recognition in the Lockport City School District finds that the process was not transparent, violated district rules and policy, and did not comply with New York State General Municipal Law.
- The report from the Office of the New York State Comptroller continues an ongoing debate over the inclusion of a $3.8 million security system in Lockport City’s schools that would have biometric facial identification and gun detection. Questions were raised over SN Technologies’ Aegis system’s collection of data, racial performance disparities, and allegations of a corrupt bidding process made in 2021 by a local resident. Then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill suspending the application of facial recognition in schools for 18 months and ordered it to be studied.
- The audit, which started in March 2021 after the resident demanded it, according to The Buffalo News, concludes that, “District officials did not demonstrate that certain goods and services were procured in accordance with the New York State General Municipal Law (GML) or the District’s procurement policies.”
- It notes compliance problems with the “piggybacking” exception to GML Section 103 in regards to two contracts totaling $240,000; a lack of transparency and competition with a $3.3 million public works contract for a facial and object recognition software license; four professional services contracts worth $238,000 that were not acquired competitively; and written quotes that did not always adhere to the District’s procurement policy. The report also found “inaccurate and misleading” language from the Board-adopted standardization resolution.
- A set of recommendations were listed in the audit, urging the district’s board of education to require the purchasing agent to enforce compliance with its procurement policy and GML bidding requirements; revise procurement policy to mandate a cost-benefit analysis before piggybacking or using group purchasing organizations contracts and review each contract to ensure it meets GML; and ensure that purchasing regulations are consistent with procurement policy thresholds for procuring goods and services below GML competitive bidding thresholds.
- For Lockport City School District officials, it suggests documenting analysis for contracts awarded in compliance with GML when piggybacking; seeking some competition before awarding license agreements to meet transparency standards; procuring professional services in a competitive manner and issuing an RFP for them in accordance with policy and regulations. The audit also recommends obtaining and documenting the required number of quotes as required by the procurement policy for all goods and services purchases below the bidding threshold and documenting and retaining attempts to obtain quotes using the appropriate forms.
- While the policies the district was found to have failed compliance with are not legal obligations, the auditor notes that the facial recognition software license would have had more “fair and reasonable” terms and conditions.

- "The District was fully justified in using a standardization approach to the procurement of its enhanced security system, given that the system was already operating in the High School, that District officials were already familiar with and satisfied by its operation, and that further implementing the enhanced security system District-wide was the most efficient and economical approach forward in order to protect the safety of District students, staff and visitors," the Bradley-Young letter said.
