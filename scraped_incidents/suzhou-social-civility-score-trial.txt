- Suzhou social 'civility score' trial
- Occurred: September 2020

- The Chinese city of Suzhou's launch of a 'civility code' early September 2020 to rank citizens’ civility and award or punish them accordingly quickly backfired after the local community took to social media to criticise the plan as overbearing, manipulative, and an abuse of privacy.
- Embedded in the 'Suzhou City Code' (蘇城碼) - a digital ID used to control residents’ movements during the COVID-19 pandemic - the new 'Suzhou App 2.0' comprised two sets of indexes: 'civility in traffic performance' and 'civility in voluntary work performance'.
- Citizens found to be jay-walking or drunk-driving would lose points, whilst those volunteering work would gain points. People with high scores would have more advantages in seeking employment, enrolling in schools, and accessing public and private services.
- Suzhou authorities suspended the system three days after its launch and said it would re-launch it after modifications had been made. It is not known to have re-launched five years later.
- An extension of its financial credit rating system, China's Social Credit System launched in 2014 and tracks and assesses the creditworthiness and trustworthiness of citizens, businesses, government bodies, and NGOs. It has been trialled in 'model cities' across China, including Suzhou, since December 2017.

- Suzhou is a city with a population of 10 million, located 100 km west of Shanghai. It is well known for its classic Chinese gardens and, since last week, one of the most Orwellian social scoring experiments to date.
- The municipal government launched a pilot for a new social behavior scoring system on 3 September 2020, also referred to as the "civility score". It is built on top of the current “health code”, a three-color scale used nationwide that decides whether or not an individual has the right to travel and enter public spaces (the health code is thought to be based on people’s health condition and travel history, but the system is reported to collect more data than just health information and travel routes).
- According to Suzhou’s local media, the "civility score" is the first in the country. The civility point system is constructed to form a "personal portrait" of a citizen’s social behaviors. It is reported by the state media CETV to be an attempt to advance the implementation of the social credit system – a comprehensive set of databases and initiatives to monitor and rate the trustworthiness of individuals. The social credit system is planned by the government to be rolled out by the end of this year (AlgorithmWatch published a report on the topic in October 2019).
- Several Chinese media outlets, like thepaper.cn and Nanfang Metropolis Daily, reported on Suzhou’s new system. Individuals start with a score of 1000 points. Violation of traffic rules and bad road manners can result in negative points and volunteer activities are rewarded with positive points.
- Local officials said the score would increase social courtesy, civilized dining and online behavior. According to an article published on the WeChat account of Suzhou’s police department, the “civility score” could serve as a digital “reference” for future warning or punishment. It is unclear what a “reference” would be, and what it could be used for.
- Worried that “civility” was too loosely defined and that the system could lead to abuses of power, many took to the internet to express their concerns. The initiative was criticized on Weibo (a Chinese micro-blogging platform and one of the few outlets where netizens can still vent out their frustrations), to be “classifying people based on unquantifiable standards” or “imposing public power in private and moral realms”. Xian-based lawyer Yang Hui drew comparisons to the "good citizen certificate" (liangmin zheng) – a document that the Japanese army issued in occupied China during the second world war.
- It is not the first time that Suzhou authorities’ attempts at digitization sparked controversy.
- In most parts of China, the "health code" is a built-in function on WeChat and Alipay - two mobile applications that practically dominate the life of most Chinese. Some cities, like Suzhou, went one step further: they developed new mobile applications that combine the health code and other digital identities, such as the national ID, the resident’s permit and the driver’s license.
- According to the Suzhou municipal government, the aim of the “Suzhou App” is to make the life of citizens easier by storing all digital credentials in one place. Usage of the Suzhou App is supposed to be voluntary, but on Weibo, a search with the key word “Suzhou App” shows citizens reporting “bad user experiences”. One said: “I have to download the app and show the code from the app in order to pick up my kids from the kindergarten”.
- Although the Suzhou App was met with moderate pushbacks from citizens, it was also accepted by many. A local resident from Suzhou who wanted to be identified as Quan told AlgorithmWatch that the Suzhou App was a localized service provided by the government, and that it caters to the needs of different demographic groups compared to the apps from Alipay or WeChat. The Suzhou App also tracks where people have been, and it is occasionally required to show one’s travel route in order to access certain indoor amenities.
- The “Suzhou App 2.0”, with its new feature of “civility score”, has caused a much more public backlash. The trial was terminated after only three days. Local authorities explained in an interview that the system still requires improvements, and that once it is rolled out, participation will not be mandatory.
- Shanghai-based lawyer Shu Shengxiang commented on his social media account that no public consultation was made before the introduction of the “health code”, but that it was done in the context of an emergency. It is a short term solution for the benefits of many, but it cannot become a widespread practice, he wrote.
- Zhu Lijia, a public management expert at the Chinese Academy of Governance in Beijing, said that the discussion of ‘civility score’ is a reminder of how far societal governance can go. “I understand the reaction of the common people”, he said. “The ‘civility score’ exposes the privacy of the masses”.

- This a translation of a Chinese story published on the Stand News on September 7, 2020. It is published here under a content partnership agreement.
- Building upon the successful implementation of its “health code” system in restricting citizens’ movement during COVID-19 pandemic, Suzhou — a Chinese city near Shanghai — attempted to launch a “civility code” in early September to rank citizens’ civility and award or punish them accordingly. But strong reactions from netizens forced authorities to postpone the plan.
- The health code is a coding system that keeps track of an individual's health condition and controls their movements accordingly. The system is embedded in various mobile applications including Alipay.
- Guards at stores, malls, and public transport will scan a QR code on visitors’ mobile phones, and only those with a “green” code are allowed to enter. If a citizen has been potentially exposed to the virus, the QR code will turn “yellow” and they will not be able to access some facilities. A red code obligates a citizen to quarantine.
- Suzhou city, known as “the Venice of the East,” was among the first Chinese cities to launch a health code system in February 2020. The health code is embedded in an application called “Suzhou City Code” (蘇城碼), which is a digital ID used to control all its residents’ movements during the COVID-19 outbreak. Suzhou was also one of a dozen cities chosen in 2018 to run a trial on the China's social credit system to rank and adjust citizen behavior with an award and punishment scheme.
- On September 3, Suzhou City Code had an upgrade introducing a new function called the “civility code.” It would work similarly as the health code, only it would be ranking people's behavior rather than their health condition.
- The new civility code had two sets of indexes, “civility in traffic performance” and “civility in voluntary work performance”. According to various reports from mainland Chinese news outlets, each citizen starts with 1,000 civility points when they first sign in to the app. If they are found jay-crossing or drunk-driving, points would be deducted; if they contribute to voluntary work, they would gain extra points.
- Suzhou city's public security bureau explained in its official WeChat account that the objective of the civility code is to “construct a civility ranking system”. In the latter stage, more indexes would be added, such as “civility in garbage recycling”, “civility in dining behavior”, “civility in online behavior,” “civility in following law and order,” among others.
- The bureau also said that those with high scores would have more advantages in seeking employment, enrolling in schools, and accessing both public and private services.
- Despite heavy censorship measures, criticism of the plan flooded Chinese social media platforms. Yu Jian-rong, a famous Chinese sociologist, was one of the most outspoken critics. He said on Weibo:
- 【危险的文明码】…问题是：1、谁有权确定文明的标准和定量分值？2、谁有权以文明的名义剥夺公民平等享受公众服务的权利？
- [Dangerous civility code]… the issue at stake is: 1. Who is to decide on the quality and quantity of civility? 2. Who has the power to deprive citizens of their rights to public service in the name of civility?
- A widely shared anonymous comment compared the system with wartime crimes against humanity:
- 【苏州文明码】由不公示财产的贪官 / 给草民划分文明等级、发证书！/ 类似曰军的良民证、那粹的犹太星标！ / 本质都一样 / 是恶魔强盗对善良平民的迫害 / “标记、分类、清除”。
- [Suzhou civility code] A bunch of corrupted officials who refused to disclose their property / are having the power to rank citizens’ civility and issue related credentials! / Such system is similar to the “good citizen ID system” during the Sino-Japanese war, or the Jewish star badges used by the Nazis! / Their nature is the same / They are used by the evil thugs to suppress the ordinary people / to “mark, categorize and eliminate.”
- A widely circulated post which has been taken down highlighted privacy violations:
- 文明码并不文明，是借文明之名，行野蛮之实的倒行逆施。…信息技术的发展和应用，大家都在裸奔，一举一动都在别人的眼里。他还要拿着显微镜挑疵，对着自己的模型对你修理、宰割，你不仅没有隐私和尊严，还被恐惧和伤害笼罩。
- The civility code has nothing to do with civility, it is a brutal measure in the name of civility….The development and application of information technology has exposed our private lives to others… Now they are using a microscope to look into your flaws and to manipulate your behavior according to their liking. You lose your privacy and dignity, fear and threats will be all around you.
- After receiving criticism from netizens, Suzhou's Office on Building Spiritual Civilization — a branch under the Propaganda Department to proactively promote good citizen behavior — announced on September 6 that the testing phase of the civility code had ended and the related authorities would modify the system, which would be implemented at a future time.
- The Office said citizen criticism online was due to a misunderstanding and stressed that, during the testing period, 5,861 users signed up to the function voluntarily and, thus far, no one had been punished or discriminated against for having low scores.
- Although the Suzhou civility code was withdrawn, many anticipated that it would be relaunched with a new name. As a popular comment on Weibo pointed out:
- 后面相继要出台守法码、失信码、洁身码……等等，请大家保持手机存储空间，生活中将全部启用“码”。
- Anticipating that there will be more upcoming codes like “follow law and order code”, “truthfulness code”, “purity code” and etc. We have to empty the storage in our mobile phone to prepare for all these codes in our lives.

- Following public backlash over a new “civility code” that would monitor various aspects of residents’ daily lives, authorities in Suzhou said Sunday that they are still developing the system, and participation will not be mandatory once it is rolled out.
- “I think people might have some slight misunderstandings about the system,” Liu Weiwen, the deputy director of Suzhou’s civilization office, told Sixth Tone on Monday. “The system is still in its trial phase. It will be introduced when it’s fully developed.”
- Suzhou, a city in the eastern Jiangsu province known for its canals, on Friday announced the so-called civility code, a function for monitoring people’s behaviors that’s accessible within the city’s official mobile app. According to the interface, each resident starts with a score of 1,000, with points then added or deducted based on traffic violations or volunteer work.
- The plan was widely criticized online, with many calling it “suffocating” and “pointless.”
- “This is an awful start. Things that are at first only ‘encouraged’ will end up being mandatory,” one user commented under a related post on microblogging platform Weibo. “Big data will strip us all naked, and this will mark the beginning of our loss of freedom.”
- 
- However, Liu said the program will not interfere with people’s lives or affect them as long as they follow the rules. So far, 5,000 people in a single district have registered for the civility code, which was “received positively” by the participants, according to Liu.
- The program aims to generate a “personal portrait” for each registered resident, with more variables such as garbage-sorting and dining habits to be added later to better evaluate residents’ civility.
- “A bad score won’t actually affect citizens on any level,” Liu said, adding that any infractions recorded would be handled by law enforcement. “The point was for well-behaved citizens with high civility scores to be respected and treated graciously in return.”
- Shanghai-based lawyer Ding Jinkun said Suzhou’s civility code doesn’t come across as an effective system. Instead, he said local laws should be applied to punish residents for violations.
- “The score system is discriminatory — it doesn’t fit the law,” Ding told Sixth Tone. “If a low score resulted in no consequences, then what’s the point of all the fuss?”
- Meanwhile, not all Suzhou residents seem to be aware of the municipal government’s new plan.
- A local woman surnamed Mao said she found out about the civility code via Weibo. Although she’s concerned it might grant authorities greater power to monitor people’s daily lives, she says she will still download it once it’s officially introduced.
- “At first I thought it was just a step toward digitization, but after reading people’s concerns I realized it could be abused by those with power,” Mao told Sixth Tone. “When it’s officially introduced, I’ll probably still register anyway out of convenience. WeChat and Alipay (two of China’s most widely used apps) weren’t mandated, either. They all get you eventually.”

- Update (Tuesday, September 15, 2020, 18:38 ET): The Suzhou city government announced that it had ended the trial of its “civility code” app on September 6. The app is not currently available. Read more about the public outcry from Global Voices, and another translated response to civility metrics at China Digital Space.
- In the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, mobile apps have simultaneously been a boon to public health and a threat to privacy. “Health codes” have quickly become ubiquitous throughout China, as individuals scan to board buses and enter restaurants—or have the door shut in their face if their rating is poor or if they have trouble using a smartphone. Now the southeastern city of Suzhou is trying to build on the trend with a “civility code” app that tracks denizens’ good and bad deeds, from running red lights to doing volunteer work, and then allow privileges accordingly. Both the health codes and civility score echo some aspects of the frequently misunderstood social credit pilot schemes seen from Chinese companies and local governments in recent years. A recent trial-run of the “Suzhou City Civility Code” was met with outrage and comparisons to dystopian fantasies.
- In the following translated article, WeChat user @鱼眼观察 (“Fisheye Observer”) distills the backlash against the “civility code,” and argues that true civility cannot be quantified.
- On September 3, Suzhou unveiled a major upgrade to the “SuChengMa” app, making it the first city in China to roll out a “civility code”—the idea is that by issuing a unique code to every resident, “civility” will function as a passport to the city. Those who have high civility scores will enjoy priority and convenience in daily life, employment, study, and recreation.
- In addition, the “civility code of Suzhou” can serve as documentation to warn or discipline those whose general civility score is below the baseline, or as proof of volunteer work completed by those who wish to become Suzhou residents.
- I found out that Suzhou actually didn’t invent the “civility code” concept. As early as July, Shengzhou, a city in central Zhejiang Province, unveiled the “civility code of Shengzhou,” adding civility score to individuals’ credit scores.
- But Shengzhou is just a county-level city. And the Shengzhou “civility code” doesn’t cover nearly as many features as its Suzhou counterpart.
- There is no doubt that we need civility to function as a society. In our daily lives, there are all types of uncivilized behaviors. Many people do need to enhance their literacy when it comes to civility. But the question is: Can civility really be quantified using a scoring system?
- Under the “Suzhou civility code,” things like volunteerism and traffic violations will earn or lose you points. They are defined in an extremely narrow way. Many other civil or uncivil behaviors cannot even be documented, let alone quantified.
- So, this “civility score” system is obviously flawed.
- It would have been less concerning if this “civility code” were nothing more than an entertaining trick. However, judging from the official rules, it seems that the “Suzhou civility code” is designed to separate people into different classes, strictly based on their level of “civility.”
- That means a person’s “level of civility” will determine their eligibility for social resources.
- The official position is clear: citizens who have high civility scores will enjoy priority and convenience in daily life, employment, study, and recreation.
- If we look at this statement closely, does it mean a citizen whose civility score is low will be barred from certain privileges?
- For example, will you lose a job opportunity because you’re not civilized enough?
- Will your kid be barred from going to certain schools because you’re not civilized enough?
- Will you be stopped from entering certain entertainment venues because you’re not civilized enough?…
- Also, this sentence from the official explanation sends a chill down my spine: “…to warn and discipline those whose general civility score is below the baseline.” What is this so-called “baseline?” How are they planning to “warn and discipline” us?
- If your score falls below a certain threshold, does that mean you’ll be looked down on, treated as a “low quality human being,” discriminated against, or become unable to survive in the city?
- I can’t help but be reminded of one episode of “Black Mirror,” where the world uses a scoring system to label people. Those with high scores have access to more than those without.
- If you are below a certain point [in the show], then you will have trouble buying a plane ticket, renting a car, or renting an affordable apartment. You won’t be eligible for certain services. And you will even be barred from entering certain places.
- If you dip below a certain threshold [in the show], even if you are healthy and able-bodied, you will lose your job and housing, and become a social outcast. Who would have thought scenes from a sci-fi series might now become reality?
- The health code is here to stay, and the civility code has followed suit. With more and more “codes” in our society, like the controversial sliding-scale health code that Hangzhou launched earlier this year, we are in a daze.
- And yet, are these so-called high-tech “codes” really scientifically sound? Because of the health code, how many senior citizens have been unable to get on public transportation? Or go to the hospital without trembling in fear? They have become refugees of this digital era.
- And I’ve seen all kinds of ranting about the health code. For example, someone says their health code turned yellow after they visited the Hulunbuir Grasslands in Inner Mongolia because the system thought they were in Russia. As a result, they can’t travel for work or go to a restaurant, gym or bank.
- YanXiaoHua: @ChinaUnicom @JiangsuUnicom Your big data says I visited Russia simply because I went to Hulunbuir. Now my health code has turned yellow. I can’t travel for work. I can’t even go to a restaurant, gym or bank. My work and my life have been severely impacted. How do you plan to resolve this? I called your customer service and was told there was nothing they could do.
- Now that the “civility code” is here, will we see more scenes like this?
- All these “codes” and big-data apps are creating a social credit system similar to the one in “Black Mirror.” When a society runs on such a flawed scoring system, will it add to our happiness?
- When a society is managed in such a “detailed” way, when our privacy is put under a magnifying glass, when each and everyone of us is treated like a piece coming down an assembly line, what life will be left to speak of?
- Obviously, if everyone strives to be the healthiest, the most hardworking, most civilized person only to chase a score, this won’t make us happier within society—it will only make us more fearful.
- When a city divides people into civilized, superior human beings, and uncivilized, inferior human beings, this is actually a mockery of civility. [Chinese]

- A city in China has sparked outrage after the authorities planned to score their citizens’ behaviour through a smartphone app that monitors people’s daily lives.
- Officials in eastern Chinese city Suzhou introduced the rating system, loosely translated as the ‘Civility Code’, to encourage people to become the model citizens in the eye of the government, reported Chinese media.
- Each resident starts with a score of 1,000, with rewards and plus-points for volunteering, minus for running a red light, according to the app.
- The city’s new plan was widely criticised by Chinese social media users. Many called it ‘suffocating’ and ‘pointless’ while others compared it to the popular British TV series Black Mirror.

- It comes as China has faced widespread doubts and criticism over its use of artificial intelligence to monitor its citizens during the pandemic.
- Tens of millions of Chinese residents were ordered to use a smartphone app that evaluates their health condition and tracks their travel history during the outbreak.
- Millions of video cameras blanket streets from major cities to small towns. Censors monitor activity on the internet and social media. State-owned telecom carriers can trace where mobile phone customers go.
- Suzhou’s new scoring system is composed of a ‘travelling index’, a ‘volunteering index’, as well as other indicators, reported Global Times.
- The travelling index is linked to road manners and one's traffic violation records, while the volunteer index is measured by a person’s involvement in volunteering work.
- The system aims to generate a ‘personal portrait’ for each resident in a bid to promote good daily habits such as trash sorting, civilised dining manners, social courtesy and online behaviour, the authorities reportedly said in a statement.

- During a brief trial last week, the smartphone app faced a fierce backlash from the public. Many web users slammed the system as ‘suffocating’ and ‘real-life Black Mirror’.
- In one episode titled Nosedive, the popular British TV series portrayed a dystopian world where people rate each other after every interaction using their smartphones, affecting their social ranking.
- One commenter wrote: ‘Oh my god, I feel like we are living in a real-life Black Mirror episode.’
- Another replied: ‘Please, give the common people some space to survive and breathe.’
- A third netizen said: ‘Big data will strip us all naked, and this will mark the beginning of our loss of freedom.’
- China has faced widespread doubts and criticism over its use of artificial intelligence to monitor its citizens during the pandemic. A passenger is pictured scanning a QR code to get his green pass at a subway station in Wuhan on this file picture taken on April 1
- A worker is pictured adjusting a surveillance camera outside the home of a journalist placed under quarantine after he had visited Wuhan in Beijing on May 3. Such security cameras are set up 'purely for the needs of counter-epidemic works', according to The Global Times
- The officials responded to the public criticism on Sunday, telling reporters that the system is still in the trial phase and will be introduced again when it’s fully developed.
- They also claimed that the public had 'certain misunderstandings about the system and it will be used on a voluntary basis', reported The Paper.
- The government is said to have stopped testing the smartphone publicly app following the public backlash.
- Security analyst Paul Bischoff, who has penned a report about the world's most-monitored cities, believes that China has taken advantage of the health crisis to speed up the implementation of state surveillance.
- Mr Bischoff told MailOnline: 'This is the exact sort of surveillance creep that privacy advocates have warned against since contact tracing apps were first introduced.
- 'There was always a risk that contact tracing apps would be used beyond their intended purpose, particularly for surveillance. It's not hard to imagine authorities taking advantage of access to contact tracing data and using it to restrict freedom of movement and assembly.
- 'Whether this actually happens or not, even having the capability to monitor users will cause them to act differently, creating a chilling effect on those freedoms.'
- Officials have used various surveillance methods, including increasing location tracking via people's phones and boosting the use of face recognition in public places, during the pandemic, according to Mr Bischoff.
- China has also been building a mass surveillance network, which boasts hundreds of millions of street cameras.

- The surveillance network has been billed as the world's most powerful facial-recognition system and aims to identify any of its 1.4 billion citizens within three seconds.
- The country's residents are due to be carefully watched by 626 million street monitors, or one camera for nearly every two people, as early as this year, according to a study.
- China has five most-monitored cities in the world. Its most-surveilled city, Chongqing, is equipped with more than 2.5 million street cameras, or one for every six people.
- Critics have cautioned over the scheme. Many have compared it to a dystopian system run by a fictional state leader, Big Brother, in George Orwell's novel 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'.

- A CHINESE city plans to monitor residents' behaviour and daily lives through a smartphone app.
- The ‘Civility Code’ rating system, was announced by officials in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou on Friday to encourage people to become good model citizens.
- The civil behaviour scoring system is accessible within the city’s official mobile app and will evaluate residents’ daily lives including employment, study and entertainment, the Global Times reports.
- According to Chinese media, each resident starts with a score of 1,000, with rewards and bonuses for volunteering, and penalties for infringements such as running a red light.
- The system is said to be composed of a 'civil transport index' - linked to road manners such as traffic violation records - and a 'volunteer index' - a person's involvement in voluntary work -among a range of other measures.
- Authorities say it aims to help strengthen awareness of social responsibilities and duty and create a “personal portrait” for each resident in a bid to promote good habits.
- Habits including road manners, volunteering, garbage sorting, civilised dining, social courtesy, online behaviour, law-abiding behaviour and food saving are all encouraged.
- The proposal has been heavily criticised online, with many calling it ‘suffocating’ and ‘pointless’ while others have drawn comparisons to the popular British TV series Black Mirror.
- In one episode titled Nosedive, the series portrays a dystopian world where citizens rate each other after every interaction using their smartphones, affecting their social ranking.
- “The controversies sparked online indicate that Chinese people’s sense of human rights is on the rise," Liu Huawen, executive director of the Human Rights Research Center at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.
- Ms Huawen added that government bodies should promote policies in a "more cautious manner to respect one’s privacy and balance power with rights".
- Over the course of the pandemic China has drawn criticism over its use of artificial intelligence to monitor citizens.
- A mandatory smartphone app was enforced for tens of millions of Chinese to evaluate their health condition and track their travel history.
- China's widespread surveillance network has been regarded as the world's most powerful facial-recognition system and aims to identify any of its 1.4 billion citizens within three seconds.
- Streets across the country are dotted with surveillance video cameras and censors monitor activity on the internet and social media.
- State-owned telecom carriers are also able to trace where mobile phone customers go.
- In response to the news, one commenter wrote: "Oh my god, I feel like we are living in a real-life Black Mirror episode".
- Another replied: "Please, give the common people some space to survive and breathe".
- Big data will strip us all naked, and this will mark the beginning of our loss of freedom.
- “This is an awful start. Things that are at first only ‘encouraged’ will end up being mandatory,” one user commented on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo.
- “Big data will strip us all naked, and this will mark the beginning of our loss of freedom.”
- Officials have responded to the criticism, emphasising the system is still in the trial phase and will be introduced when it’s fully developed.
- “I think people might have some slight misunderstandings about the system,” Liu Weiwen, the deputy director of Suzhou’s civilization office, told local publication Sixth Tone.
- “The system is still in its trial phase. It will be introduced when it’s fully developed.”
- The government is said to have stopped testing the smartphone publicly app following the public backlash.
- Security analyst Paul Bischoff believes that China has taken advantage of the health crisis to speed up the implementation of state surveillance.
- Mr Bischoff told MailOnline: "This is the exact sort of surveillance creep that privacy advocates have warned against since contact tracing apps were first introduced.
- "There was always a risk that contact tracing apps would be used beyond their intended purpose, particularly for surveillance. It's not hard to imagine authorities taking advantage of access to contact tracing data and using it to restrict freedom of movement and assembly.
- "Whether this actually happens or not, even having the capability to monitor users will cause them to act differently, creating a chilling effect on those freedoms."
- China has five of the most-monitored cities in the world.
- Its most-surveilled city, Chongqing, is equipped with more than 2.5 million street cameras, or one for every six people.
