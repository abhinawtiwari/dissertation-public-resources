- Technical problems with India's Aadhaar biometric ID system have resulted in the deaths of scores of villagers in Jharkhand state and elsewhere, with some committing suicide and others suffering severe malnutrition.
- The glitches have meant that villagers have been unable to get food rations or subsidised grain, sometimes without explanation. Some groups, including vulerable minority groups such as the Parhaiya, have been denied their legal entitlement of subsidised grain for failing to correctly link their ration cards with Aadhaar.
- Campaigners told The Guardian that the system is fraught with problems, including authentication issues, with fingerprints scanning not working properly, officials failing to offer timely support, and poor internet coverage meaning people can often not access the system.

- On Friday morning, Butan Singh took a break working his land in the forested Kumandih region of Jharkhand and took the bus to Manika, 20 km away. He was headed to a public hearing, where he had heard people’s grievances about rations were being recorded.
- Butan Singh grows paddy on his small piece of land which usually lasts him seven months. The rest of the year, his family relies on the subsidised rice – 25 kg a month at Rs 1 per kg – under the National Food Security Act. This year, though, Butan Singh stopped receiving his rations in August, a month after the state made it compulsory to link ration cards to Aadhaar, a 12-digit biometric-based unique identity number the Indian government wants every citizen to have.
- “Since bhaado [the month of August], my family’s food rations have been stopped,” the 55-year-old farmer, who walks with a stick, said at the hearing. “We used to buy 25 kilo rice from the ration shop every month. But now our card has been cancelled. Why?”
- At the hearing organised by activists of the Right to Food Campaign, Jharkhand, and the MNREGA Sahayata Kendra, Manika, in presence of food and civil supplies department officials and representatives of the district administration of Latehar, Butan Singh, like many others, recorded his problem and waited to understand why his rations had been stopped and when they would be restored. By the end of the day, he had only got assurances from the officials that his problem would be looked into.
- The government in Jharkhand, like in several other states, has asked for all ration cards to be linked with Aadhaar and mandated that only card holders whose fingerprints are authenticated online from the Aadhaar database would get subsidised grain.
- In Jharkhand, 86% of all rural households are entitled to subsidised foodgrain under the Food Security Act. But since July, this right has been routinely violated because beneficiaries have failed to enrol for Aadhaar or get it linked with their ration cards. Or because of network and authentication problems at fair price shops.
- For more vulnerable households, this has proved fatal. At least four persons have reportedly starved to death – all in the state’s remote, poorer regions – after being denied ration on account of Aadhaar. The deaths of Santoshi Kumari, 11, in Simdega and Premni Kunwar, 71, in Garhwa made it to national headlines.
- Senior state functionaries have denied that glitches in government processes are to blame for the worsening condition of such households, and insisted that beneficiaries are not being coerced into Aadhaar enrolment and linking.
- But at the public hearing on Friday in one of India’s poorest districts, Latehar, hundreds of low-income card holders, including the Parhaiya who are categorised as a particularly vulnerable Adivasi group, recounted instances of being denied their legal entitlement of subsidised grain for failing to correctly link their ration cards with Aadhaar by the July deadline.
- Chanaiya Devi, a tribal farmer from Dundu village in Manika block, said her eight-member household received 40 kg rice a month until August, when it was stopped without explanation.
- Fatima Bibi, a 70-year-old farmer from Namudag, Manika, said her family members enrolled for Aadhaar and tried to seed it with their ration cards, yet the cards were cancelled.
- Several families said after July, when Aadhaar was made compulsory, they have been wrongly shown as high-income households, which are entitled only to subsidised kerosene, not grain.
- Ramjit Ram, a 70-year-old visually impaired man from Rankikala in Manika, said he no longer gets his entitlement of 30 kilo rice because the machine at the fair price shop shows he is entitled only to kerosene. “How did this change, they do not say,” he said.
- Mahru Lohara, another elderly farmer, said he too does not get 30 kilo rice anymore. The last two months, he was told he could take only two litres of kerosene.
- Durga Singh of Dundu, Manika, said after the death of his wife Kopli Devi, his four-member family’s ration card was cancelled with reason given as “death”, apparently because she was listed as the head of the household and the ration card was linked to her Aadhaar. “But the rest of us are still alive, why did the machine cut our rice?” Durga Singh wanted to know.
- Most families whose rations have been stopped have not been given any reason. This is confirmed by a door-to-door survey conducted by the Right to Food Campaign, Jharkhand, and the MNREGA Sahayata Kendra, Manika. The surveyors found that of the 135 cancelled ration cards, two were declared farzi or fake during Aadhaar linking while three were deemed to be duplicate. Ration cards of six households were cancelled when their heads died and 26 cards were cancelled for “not linking to Aadhaar” for “errors in linking”. But the majority of the cards, 96, were scrapped without explanation.
- Although the main stated aim of Aadhaar linking and biometric authentication is to reduce pilferage of grain, several card holders testified at the public hearing to ration dealers demanding bribes of Rs 500-Rs 800 for Aadhaar linking and giving them less than their entitlement of ration even after they completed their fingerprint authentication.
- “In July, the dealer entered something in his machine and the slip said I had taken two months of grain but he gave me only one month’s,” said Sohbatiya Devi, a 68-year-old farmer from Dundu. “He is giving 15 kilo grain, not 25 kilo as we are entitled to.”
- Responding to the complaints, District Food Supply Officer Selprabha Kujur said her department was not in a position to give ration to beneficiaries who did not have Aadhaar. “You cannot get ration without Aadhaar,” she said. “The software will not allow it.”
- She admitted that there were “practical difficulties” in linking ration cards to Aadhaar. “Because there are network issues and biometric errors, and we are aware of these problems, we are asking you to link your mobile numbers to your Aadhaar, so your mobile can provide authentication through one-time password,” she told the card holders.
- The district administration, she added, was trying to implement the state government’s instruction to allow continued access to grain to low-income households facing problems linking Aadhaar by noting their names in a separate register.
- Kujur also said the Latehar administration would organise a camp on December 18-20 to ensure “accurate Aadhaar enrolment and linking.
- Block Supply Officer Habib Khan told the complainants their ration cards were cancelled following a March 2017 order from the chief secretary’s office to not give ration to anyone without Aadhaar.

- Claimants are given a 12-digit number linked to their data, and if something goes wrong they can be refused food
- Motka Manjhi had been back and forth to the ration shop four or five times, his wife said, but on each occasion he returned empty-handed. His thumbprint, needed to prove his identity, wasn’t registering on the new system.
- He was told to do an online update. But to do so he would need to get to a private centre – a four-mile journey from his village in Dumka, in the state of Jharkhand, north-east India. This would mean missing at least a day’s potential work, which he desperately needed to buy food. And even if he made the trek, there was no guarantee that the system, which often suffers from network outages, would be working properly. What was to be done?
- In the past, Manjhi and other low-income Indians only needed papers to pick up subsidised grains to feed themselves. But the welfare system in India has undergone dramatic change.
- Each person claiming support is now required to have an Aadhaar, a unique 12-digit number that is linked to their biometric and demographic data. The scheme has grown so quickly since its introduction in 2009 that it now covers more than 1.2 billion people and is the world’s largest biometric identification system.
- The Indian government argued that this system would revolutionise welfare: computerised checks would stop fraudsters from siphoning off other people’s benefits, allowing more money to reach the poor. But campaigners say its design is flawed and it is riddled with technological glitches. They argue it has become a Kafkaesque nightmare that has caused misery for the very people it claims to protect.
- Despite the serious concerns raised by economists and poverty experts, the system kept on growing and is now involved in access to anything from a pension to medical reimbursements or disaster emergency relief. Activists say in some cases parents are wrongly being asked for an Aadhaar number in order to enrol their children in school.
- If there’s a fault in the system, access to an array of support can abruptly halt. “Decisions about you are made by a centralised server, and you don’t even know what has gone wrong,” said Reetika Khera, an associate professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad. “People don’t know why [welfare support] has stopped and they don’t know who to go to to fix the problem.”
- Even if a person is lucky enough to find out what has caused the disruption, this doesn’t mean the problem will be solved. “Officials at district level or lower district level may be able to tell you why your payment has stopped; they may not be able to tell you how to fix it,” Khera said.
- In Majhi’s case, the problem of his unrecognised thumbprint was left unresolved as he couldn’t take the time to make the trek to the centre. Meals were missed – just a few to start, then more and more often – and Manjhi became extremely thin.
- On 22 May he collapsed outside the family home. Neighbours rushed to help as his wife, Alabati Devi, tried to resuscitate him. An ambulance took him to hospital but it was too late. He died aged 50.
- No one declared the cause of his death, but the family believe it was starvation. “When he came back from looking for work he said: ‘Give me food or I will die,’” said Devi. There was nothing to give him. Hours later he fainted. All he had eaten that day was a small portion of rice and toddy palm fruit, which grows nearby their home.
- “He was malnourished because of the lack of the food,” said Devi, who noted he had no other illnesses.
- The family was living hand to mouth, said Bijay Prasad Kapi, a social activist who has supported Devi and many others. “They didn’t have any food, they couldn’t afford to store any rice. They didn’t know where to get help.” Devi was entitled to a pension but this had not arrived in her account since January.
- The block development officer for Majhi’s neighborhood was not reachable and the supply officer declined to comment.
- Activists have tracked 13 cases in Jharkhand where people who were refused support due to aadhaar glitches have allegedly died of starvation. One was an 11-year-old girl. The death of Santoshi Kumari, whose family’s ration card was cancelled because it was not linked to Aadhaar, shocked the country in 2017. Officials denied that Santoshi died of starvation and said her death was due to malaria. Other cases of alleged starvation deaths have also been denied by the government.
- Campaigners say the system continues to be fraught with problems. Fingerprints don’t scan properly, officials fail to offer timely assistance and internet coverage is too poor for the system to function.
- Pansure Murmu, who runs a ration shop in Jammu, said Aadhaar worked well on the whole, but she admitted the network signal was a problem. “We have to move the machine one or two kilometres to get the signal,” she said.
- Others have been known to take their customers to a hilly mound to get a signal for internet access. Residents in Lurgumi Kalan village in Mahuadanr, also in Jharkhand, went without rations for two months this summer because there was no connection, according to researchers at the campaign group Right To Food (RTF).
- Rice was distributed to the village only after one resident, 64-year-old Ramcharan Munda, died. Munda, who lived with his family in abject poverty in a small mud hut, had not eaten for two and a half days, activists found. Residents and the dealer had reportedly asked the administration on multiple times to revert to an offline system but this did not happen.
- Government officials issued a notice stating that if fingerprint scans failed, people should not be denied rations. But Ashrafi Nand Prasad, a state coordinator for RTF, said this message had not filtered down in many areas. “The local ration shop owners were not doing that,” he said. Like Manjhi, people were simply turned away with nothing.
- Access to other benefits linked to Aadhaar, such as pensions and wages offered through a government scheme that guarantees 100 days’ work, is equally chaotic. Researchers at the Indian School of Business found that 68% of total payments made under the work scheme in Jharkhand, which were processed through Aadhaar, were misdirected. Such errors, along with delays in payments, are common and have discouraged some from finding work through the scheme.
- “Payments were always an issue and they were getting delayed even before Aadhaar, but one could see improvements happening for sure,” said Siraj Dutta, who works on social policy in Jharkhand. “With Aadhaar, everything went crazy and new problems came up.”
- Shrimati Devi, 70, who lives in Dumka, Jamma, said she had not received her 1,000-rupeesa-month pension for months. She eventually discovered that it was being paid to someone else’s bank account. Government staff told her to speak to the bank and the bank told her to speak to the individual who was receiving her money.
- “We have tried many times, now we are hopeless,” said her daughter, Suma Devi. “In our family no one is in a government job, so [the pension] was very helpful,” she said, adding that the family was dependent on precarious private-sector work.
- Corruption and poor management have proved huge problems in the welfare system. Research by economists Jean Drèze and Reetika Khera estimated that 85% of the grains meant for poorer families in Jharkhand did not reach consumers in the financial year 2004-05. But this figure was already improving prior to the introduction of Aadhaar, and had fallen to 44% by 2011-12.
- The problem of duplicate or fake cards, which Aadhaar promised to target, was actually “extremely negligible”, said Dutta. Corruption was happening elsewhere: grains were going missing before they reached the ration shop and dealers were fudging their records to suggest they had given plenty to customers, when actually some grains were held back.
- After Aadhaar was rolled out, the Jharkhand government claimed it had wiped out around 1m fake ration cards. Campaigners say many of those were genuine cards held by people who hadn’t successfully obtained an Aadhaar number and linked this to their card. A survey conducted by RTF found that of a sample of 135 cancelled ration cards, only two were declared fake and three deemed to be duplicates.
- Some were cancelled for not linking to Aadhaar or because the individual had died, though the majority, 96, were scrapped without any explanation.
- People whose cards are cancelled can face hurdles in getting back into the welfare system, partly because the number of recipients for some support is dictated by a quota set by the central government. In Jharkhand, 86% of rural households are eligible to receive subsidised grain, but this figure is based on a 2011 socio-economic caste census and the population has grown considerably since then.
- Some states have chosen to supplement funds from central government to ensure vulnerable families are not left out Not Jharkhand, however, where some families are turned away or face long delays.
- Alabati Devi’s family are now getting the right support, although Kapi said they did not officially have the correct ration cards. Things changed after activists raised awareness of Manjhi’s death through the media.
- “Because a lot of these [problems] are affecting the poor, who don’t have a voice in the system, a lot of it is going unnoticed and unchallenged,” said Khera.
- She expressed concern about other families in Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha – India’s poorest states. “Where is the dignity in all this? These programmes have been put in place to allow people to live a life of dignity, and you are reducing them to beggars.”

- On July 27, Rajendra Birhor, a 40-year-old Adivasi, starved to death in Ramgarh, a district in eastern Jharkhand. He belonged to a “particularly vulnerable tribal group” and should have had access to at least two welfare measures that could have saved his life: a pension and a ration card.
- Like him, 13 others died of starvation in Jharkhand over the last 10 months, according to the latest available data from the Right To Food campaign, an advocacy group. They should have all benefited from Antodyay Anna Yojana, the food ration scheme meant for the poorest of poor in India.
- In most cases, the Jharkhand government denied that deaths were caused by starvation (You can read those denials here, here and here). The state food and supply minister Saryu Roy has accused food activists, who see a link between starvation and these deaths, of “playing politics”.

- IndiaSpend spoke to medical experts and social activists and found that the government response does not take into account two factors involving the links between malnutrition and starvation:
- As the following table shows, in half the cases of starvation deaths reported from Jharkhand between September 2017 and July 2018, the deceased did not get the ration promised under the public distribution scheme and AAY.
- The reason can be traced to the complications arising from the government mandate that ration cards and bank accounts be linked to Aadhaar, according to RTF campaigners. Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the Indian government to every citizen and declared mandatory for various government welfare schemes.
- In line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Digital India, the Jharkhand government in July 2016 transitioned to a “paperless” public distribution system, linked to individual Aadhaar numbers, as TheWire.in reported on July 18, 2017.
- This system has two requirements: One, each person’s ration card has to be linked to their Aadhaar card; and two, each time a person wants ration under PDS, she must have biometric authentication done at a ‘point of sale’ machine, which then calculates eligibility. These machines are installed at PDS shops, where the dealer is supposed to authenticate each transaction.
- In the two months after this Aadhaar-PDS linkage rule, in Ranchi district, ration-card holders received only 49 percent, or less than half, of their entitlement, according to an analysis of government data in July and August 2016 by development economist Jean Dreze.
- The denial of foodgrain in Jharkhand has been reported before (here, here and here) and contested.
- @roysaryu 'ji, Hope you take note of the story of this elderly woman. #UshaDevi lives in Ranchi, has #Aadhar & #RationCard & hasn't received her entitled grains from #PDS dealer in last #6MONTHS. A widow with both her sons dead, she can be 'face' of next #hungerdeath. @DC_Ranchi pic.twitter.com/JoIapecQPV
- In October 2017, the Jharkhand government claimed that Aadhaar is not mandatory for collecting foodgrain under PDS. However, district administrations in the state continue to adhere to the mandatory Aadhaar-ration card rule, according to RTF activists. This happened in Birhor’s case as well.
- “Whatever the food minister or others may have told the media, the Jharkhand government never retracted its policy of compulsory linkage of ration cards with Aadhaar,” Dreze, also a visiting professor at Ranchi University, told IndiaSpend.
- Activists are demanding that Aadhaar be delinked from all social-security schemes, including pensions, to save the poor from distress. Swati Narayan, an activist with the RTF in Ranchi, believes that the Aadhaar-ration integration requirement is behind the trail of starvation deaths in Jharkhand.
- “The Jharkhand government needs to immediately universalise the rural ration eligibility from 86 percent to 100 percent of the population to ensure that no family is left out,” she said. “Additionally, excluded families should be immediately paid compensatory food security allowance for the last one year at least to prevent more horrific deaths due to starvation.”
- Food and supply minister Roy insisted the 14 deaths were not related to starvation. “(They) can be attributed to the lack of ration cards, which is due to the lacunae in the government system, but they are not starvation deaths,” he told IndiaSpend. “RTF activists are hyper-ventilated (sic) people who are motivated against BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] governments. I have not seen them commenting on the starvation deaths in Delhi.”
- On July 27, three sisters were found dead under unexplained circumstances in Delhi’s Mandawali area. They possibly died of malnutrition or starvation, their postmortem reports said.
- Given the inequalities in India’s population–India’s top 1 percent have 73 percent of India’s wealth–it is the government’s responsibility to provide food and nutrition to the marginalised, said Anjali Bhardwaj, an activist with the RTF in Delhi. “In Delhi and Jharkhand, the political will is lacking,” she said. “They may promise a lot of things, but on ground, the ill-thought move of PDS-Aadhaar linkage is starving people.”
- Shamika Ravi, research director, Brookings India and a member of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, countered that the emphasis should be on resolving systemic problems, not discrediting Aadhaar.
- “Any exclusion error or case, where a person is being denied their benefits, is unacceptable and absolutely unjustified,” she told IndiaSpend. “However, the focus should be on strengthening the Aadhaar system. There are exclusions, yes, but what is still not clear to me is at exactly what stage is the problem (occuring)? Is it a problem at the point of authentication? Or there is a problem in how the PDS programme is linked with Aadhaar? Aadhaar has become a favorite whipping boy of many activists, but we need to identity the exact pain points and work on strengthening them.”
- Dreze concurs partially with Ravi. “If Aadhaar is to be used at all for welfare schemes, it should be restricted to cases where it serves a clear purpose and where Aadhaar seeding can be done in a reliable and non-coercive manner,” he said. “Aadhaar-based biometric authentication should never be made compulsory.”
- In June 2018, the Jharkhand government made an autopsy a must for starvation deaths. But campaigners say this is not a fail-proof method for determining if death was caused by hunger.
- “Historically, if post-mortems/autopsies have found a single grain of rice in bodies, they haven’t been classified as starvation deaths,” said Dipa Sinha, assistant professor at Ambedkar University, Delhi. “In Odisha, people have eaten mango kernels as they didn’t have anything else to eat. So, officially, they may not be starvation deaths medically, but I would classify them thus. In Jharkhand, the government has been hiding behind technicalities to absolve itself of responsibilities, but we cannot miss the fact that denial of food leads to chronic malnutrition.”
- Narayan pointed out that the medical and social histories of those living in starvation zones are more important than autopsies to fix the reason for death. “After one year of screaming, the Jharkhand government has finally changed its definition of starvation, but has done little else,” she said.
- In March, the Jharkhand government set up a nine-member committee which was supposed to define parameters by which starvation deaths can be established officially. However, the committee has missed its second deadline to compile the report and make it public, as the New Indian Express reported on July 31.
- “From what I know, the committee has analysed information and (is) almost done with its report,” Jharkhand minister Roy said. “It will release the final report very soon. However, I cannot comment on the exact date as it is an autonomous committee and they will take their own time and decisions.”
- There is no need to set up a committee to define starvation as a lot of literature and research already exists on the subject, said NC Saxena, former secretary of the erstwhile Planning Commission and former commissioner of a Supreme Court-monitored committee on food and hunger. “In my experience, in Jharkhand, the government usually under-reports starvation and malnutrition levels,” he said. “They should rather focus their energies on collecting proper data and on how severely malnourished children and people can be identified and intervened (with).”
- In September 2017, an 11-year-old girl Santoshi died allegedly due to starvation. She and her family did not get foodgrain because their Aadhaar cards had not being linked to ration cards. In response to criticism over Santoshi’s death, Amit Malviya, incharge of the BJP’s information technology cell, cited a district official’s report and claimed that her death was due to malaria, and not starvation.

- However, experts told IndiaSpend that malnutrition and disease are so interlinked that it is hard to separate the two. Undernourished children principally die of common infections and immune defects, according to this 2016 paper.
- “Lack of adequate nutrition or undernutrition leads to infections which can be life-threatening,” said Bhavna Dhingra, a pediatrician with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal. “These infections can reduce the appetite of children, which severely affects the already precarious nutrition situation.”
- Giridhara R Babu, an epidemiologist and additional professor at the Public Health Foundation of India, explained how malnutrition works to weaken the body: “In the shorter term, malnutrition leads to weight loss due to depletion of fat and muscle mass, including some of the organs. In the long run, prolonged decreased dietary intake leads to a reduction in functional energy reserves and changes in body composition.”
- Starvation itself rarely results in death which is usually caused by infections among those lacking in malnutrition, said Nehal Vaidya, a pediatrician from Bhuj, Gujarat.
- “In case of a reported case of child malnutrition, where a child has stayed hungry for many days, first, a clinical assessment should be done to analyse the child’s body and hunger and then the appropriate intervention should be done and the parents should be counselled on how to feed the child,” she said. “However, in rural and urban areas, lack of infrastructure is a big problem. You need specialist doctors, paediatricians, nutritionists and public health experts to deal with such cases.”
- Severely malnourished children in state-run malnutrition treatment centres in Jharkhand showed poor recovery, most demonstrated poor weight gain, and a high number of illnesses were reported post- discharge, according to this 2018 paper which examined the efficacy of an MTC in Jharkhand. Malnourishment at an early age can have long-term consequences, affecting an individual’s motor, sensory, cognitive, social and emotional development, as IndiaSpend reported on July 22, 2017.
- There is a 90 percent shortfall of specialists (surgeons, obstetricians and gynaecologists, doctors, and paediatricians) across community health centres in Jharkhand, according to the Rural Health Statistics 2017. Other than specialists, India is short of doctors in general. India’s doctor-to-population ratio of 1:1,674 is 75 percent lower than Argentina and 70 percent lower than the U.S., as IndiaSpend reported on November 16, 2016.
- The CHCs constitute the secondary level of health care and provide specialist care to patients referred from primary health centres, four of which feed into each CHC, serving roughly 80,000 people in tribal, hill or desert areas and about 1.2 lakh on the plains.

- The poor are literally starving to death in Jharkhand — at least 12 people have died due to starvation in the past 10 months in the state. But the BJP-led state government is refusing to even acknowledge hunger as the cause of these deaths, let alone taking responsibility.
- The Right To Food Campaign (RTFC) released details of these starvation deaths, along with fact-finding reports, on 21 June 2018 — while holding the government accountable for failing to act and making false claims in the face of flagrant violations of the Right to Food of the people.
- According to the RTFC findings, the reasons for these deaths have invariably been a failure in the delivery of ration, and/or pension in some cases. In most of these cases, the ration or pension was denied due to problems engendered by the mandatory linkage and authentication with Aadhaar.
- “The starvation deaths have exposed the exclusion of poor households from the Public Distribution System (PDS) and the alarming levels of food insecurity in the state,” it said.

- But instead of taking action to address the problems, state food minister Saryu Roy has been busy making “a series of fallacious claims and accusations against activists who are highlighting the gross violations of right to food in Jharkhand,” said the Right To Food Campaign in a statement.
- Three of these starvation deaths occurred in June alone. “The recent deaths of Savitri Devi in Giridh, Meena Musahar in Chatra and Chintaman Malhar in Ramgarh expose the government’s lack of seriousness to address the issue of starvation in the state,” the RTFC said. “Even after a spate of deaths before these three victims, the government took negligible cognizance of the alarming situation.”
- The first starvation death in Jharkhand to make headlines last year was that of an 11-year-old girl, named Santoshi Kumari, who died of hunger on 28 September 2017 in Simdega district after her family’s ration card was cancelled as it was not linked to Aadhaar. Santoshi had not eaten for eight days before she died.
- Elaborating on the details of the three latest hunger deaths, the Right To Food Campaign statement said: “Savitri Devi, a 60-year old widow, died on 2 June 2018 after prolonged hunger and inadequate nutrition. Her family members do not remember the last time they cooked dal.”
- The RTFC said that Savitri Devi’s family did not have a ration card, “despite applying for one at the Gram Panchayat a few months ago.”
- Read More: Right to Food Being Violated, Worsened By Aadhaar, Say People At Public Hearing
- With this finding, the RTFC also refuted the state government’s claim that Savitri Devi’s family did not apply for a ration card. The Campaign also said that contrary to another claim made by the government, “Savitri Devi was never admitted in RIMS Ranchi for treatment.”
- In fact, the RTFC said, even though her widow pension was sanctioned in 2014, “the first pension instalment was credited only in April 2018 after her Aadhaar was linked with the scheme. Savitri Devi was not informed that her pension was credited.”
- Then there was 50-year-old Chintaman Malhar of Mandu block in Ramgarh district who “died a hungry man” on 13 June.
- Chintaman too did not have a ration card, but the government officials “tricked Chintaman’s son into signing a statements that told a different tale,” said the RTFC.
- “Not surprisingly, the Food Minister later claimed that the son himself admitted that his father died a natural death. His insensitivity towards the issue was also reflected when he suggested that the victim’s body be exhumed for post-mortem. He interpreted the son’s refusal for this as a proof that the victim did not die of starvation.”
- Then there was the death of Meena Musahar, a ragpicker in Chatra district, who died “in destitution and acute poverty”.
- According to Meena’s neighbours, said the RTFC, “she was so malnourished that she could not feed her infant child who died a week before her.”
- Meena did not have a ration card. But the Jharkhand government conveniently absolved itself of responsibility as she may have been a migrant from Gaya in Bihar who came to Jharkhand in search of livelihoods.
- In fact, “the Food Minister even said that his department was not responsible for the starvation death of persons who did not have ration cards.”
- Read More: Aadhaar Hearings: 10 More Reasons To Be Worried About The Act
- “Contrary to government’s claims, the immediate causes of the 12 recent starvation deaths include denial of subsidised rice due to absence of a ration card, cancellation of ration card due to absence of Aadhaar linkage or failure of Aadhaar-based biometric authentication,” said the RTFC statement.
- “It is true that many of the starvation victims were also ill, but they would probably not have succumbed to hunger if they received adequate nutrition and medical care.”
- The RTFC pointed out that denial of social security pensions and absence of work under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) contributed to the starvation deaths and the destitution of the families of the deceased.
- At least four of the victims were entitled to pension, “but were either not issued a pension or did not receive their pension due to administrative lapses or Aadhaar-related issues.
- The activists also raised questions on the coverage of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) — a Government of India scheme launched in December 2000 whereby millions of the poorest of the poor families are identified from among the Below Poverty Line (BPL) families covered under the targetted PDS and given foodgrains at a highly subsidised rate of Rs 2 per kg for wheat and Rs 3 per kg for rice.
- The RTFC said that the families of most of these people who died of hunger, “despite living a life of acute poverty, did not have AAY ration cards.”
- But the Food Minister has instead proposed setting up of grain banks, said the RTFC. “Even if such banks are established, they will fail to ensure universal access to food security as a matter of right.”
- In light of the tragically avoidable deaths of the poorest and the continuing violations of the Right to Food, the RTFC activists have demanded the universalisation of the Public Distribution System in rural areas. They have also demanded “inclusion of pulses and edible oil in the PDS — a promise made by the Food Minister himself.”
- The Right To Food activists have also reiterated their demand that the government immediately delink the Aadhaar from the PDS as well as from other public services, and also that it “strengthen the grievance redress system to be established under the National Food Security Act.”
- The Campaign has also demanded immediate withdrawal of the “Direct Benefit Transfer for food security” pilot in Nagri block of Ranchi district.
- Drawing attention in their reports to the failure of this Direct Benefit Transfer pilot for food security, the activists said the state government’s reluctance to withdraw the pilot revealed the government’s indifference towards people’s food insecurity.
- “By all accounts, the results of the pilot are disastrous. However, the Food Department is yet to roll back this pilot or compensate ration cardholders who are denied their legal entitlement to subsidised foodgrain in this ill-conceived initiative. In fact, it has even failed to make public the findings of the government’s own social audit of this pilot.”

- This is a story of how a lifeline can turn fatal, thanks to a technical glitch.An 11-year-old Indian girl starved to death as her family was struck off the government welfare rolls for not being able to link their ration card with Aadhaar, because of a technical snag.Aadhaar is a 12-digit biometric identity number issued by the Indian government to every resident of India, now considered as a lifeline by many.Santoshi Kumari, a resident of Jharkhand's Simdega district, starved for four days before breathing her last, her mother Koili Devi claimed. Since February, the family had not received any ration, surviving on doles from villagers and the mid-day meal Santoshi would get at her school, a Hindustan Times report revealed.When the stocks finished and the school got closed, Santoshi was deprived of food. She had severe stomachaches and cramps on September 27 and passed away within 24 hours."The family was not receiving ration due to the government's mandate for Aadhaar seeding," Dheeraj Kumar, one of the five activists involved in the investigation, was quoted as saying in the report. The family had Aadhaar cards but the seeding failed because of technical glitches, the activists added.While admitting to the system failure, Jaldega block development officer Sanjay Kumar Kongari said it was malaria that took toll on Santoshi.Santoshi's father didn't have a regular income. So, her other family members did odd jobs to make ends meet.Even though the state government has pushed for Aadhaar seeding for all welfare schemes to stamp out fakes and duplicates from welfare rolls, activists have pointed to implementation snags with the seeding process mostly in remote areas with weak internet connectivity, the report says.A team of food commission experts has probed Santoshi's case and will file its report soon.

- While the state government has blamed her death on illness, the family claims the 30-year-old was not suffering from any major ailment.

- New Delhi: A 30-year-old woman died in Pakur district in Jharkhand on January 23, after being denied ration for four months under the public distribution system (PDS) due to the failure of Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, according to the Right to Food Campaign, Jharkhand.
- The death of Lukhi Murmu, a resident of Dhawadangal village of Hiranpur block in Pakur, is the third such incident in the past two months. Earlier in January, The Wire had reported how two similar deaths had taken place in the state since early December 2017.
- On December 25, Etwariya Devi, a 67-year-old widow, reportedly died due to starvation in Sonpurwa village of Garhwa district’s Majhiaon block. Prior to that on December 1, Premani Kunwar, a 64-year-old widow, had died due to hunger and exhaustion in Danda block of Garhwa district due to glitches in the alleged Aadhaar-bank integration system.
- Family went without ration since October 2017
- In the latest case, Murmu died due to prolonged under nutrition and exhaustion, the Campaign said. It noted that she was living with her 14-year old sister, Phulin, in abject poverty. The siblings survived on just rice and sometimes even went to sleep hungry.
- Four months ago, their troubles compounded when they were denied access to ration through the PDS due to failure of the Aadhaar-based biometric authentication. Murmu’s family, comprising Murmu, Phulin and two more sisters, had an Antyodaya ration card which was issued under the National Food Security Act.
- When “priority” became a disadvantage
- Around June 2017, the Campaign said, this ration card was converted to the ‘Priority’ category without the family’s knowledge. Though the term would suggest that it would have entitled the family to rations on a priority basis, that was not the case. The conversion, in fact, led to reduction in the household’s monthly grain entitlement by 15 kg.
- Since Murmu was too weak to go to the ration shop – which was about a kilometer from her residence – she sent Phulin there several times. However, the young girl returned home empty handed each time since she was unable to authenticate her identity through the point of sale (PoS) machine.
- During this period, Murmu’s another sister went to the PDS shop. The dealer, however, refused to give her any rice as only Murmu and Phulin’s Aadhaar numbers were seeded with their ration card and not of the other two sisters.
- As a consequence, since October, the family did not have any PDS food grains.
- Even on the day Murmu died, Phulin had gone to the ration shop in the hope that she would be able to get some grains. But it was not to be.
- Government claims woman died of illness
- The state government has, however, not acknowledged the death as one caused by starvation. In the official report to the state food secretary, Pakur’s deputy commissioner has ascribed illness as the cause of Murmu’s death. The report is understandably silent on the nature of illness. Also, as no post mortem was conducted after the woman’s death, the family would now find it difficult to establish the real cause.
- It is pertinent to note that Murmu’s family has categorically stated that she was not suffering from any major illness. In fact, they pointed out that in the weeks preceding her death, she was tested for tuberculosis and kala-azar and results were negative for both.
- The deputy commissioner’s report argued that Murmu could not have died of hunger as she possessed some land, and had two cows and paddy in her house at the time of her death. But the right to food activists claim that while Murmu did possess these assets, it does not change the fact that she died due to starvation. “Government officials argue that the family could have sold its land, cattle or paddy for food. However, the deterioration in Lukhi Murmu’s condition was gradual and there was no way for her family to predict her death,” the Campaign said.
- What the ration dealer had to say
- In the wake of the divergent claims of the family and the state administration, it becomes necessary to note how the ration dealer made contradictory statements to the local administration and the Campaign.
- “As per the ration dealer’s testimony to the local administration, no one from Lukhi Murmu’s household came to the PDS shop in the last four months. However, to the Right to Food Campaign fact-finding team, the dealer admitted that Phulin came to collect her household’s rations but was turned away due to biometric authentication failure,” the Campaign noted.
- It further said that while local officials claim to have given instructions to all the dealers in Pakur to also give PDS rations to those households that are unable to authenticate themselves through Aadhaar, the dealer claimed ignorance about any such instruction.
- Food ministry instructions were blatantly violated by dealer
- The Campaign has recalled how following the death of Santosh Kumari at Simdega in September 2017, the food ministry had issued a notification which stated that even in case of failure of biometric authentication or lack of Aadhaar, ration dealers should give PDS rations to eligible households.
- The food ministry and the Unique Identification Authority of India, the Campaign said, had repeatedly referred to this notification to claim that no one now would be denied their entitlement due to Aadhaar. “However, on the ground, large-scale exclusion from public services continues due to Aadhaar …. The repeated denial of food entitlements in Jharkhand’s PDS also exposes the lack of seriousness in the state government towards addressing the issues in delivery of ration,” the Campaign charged.

- For six to seven days every month, says Muniya Devi, her five-member family doesn't get food to eat.
- The frail 31-year-old lives with her children in an arid village in Jharkhand, one of India's poorest states. Her husband, Bushan, works in a brick kiln some 65km (40 miles) away, earning 130 rupees ($1.90; £1.40) a day.
- For the last three years, they have been deprived of subsidised food from India's vast public distribution system, a lifeline for the poor. That is not because supplies have dried up at the neighbourhood shop, but because their ration cards have not been linked to their biometric-based 12-digit personal identification numbers.
- A BBC investigation found many others in the state with similar complaints.
- More than a billion Indians now have the ID number, called Aadhaar, meaning foundation in Hindi. What started as a voluntary programme to tackle benefit fraud has now grown into the world's most ambitious, and controversial, digital identity programme. It has also become increasingly necessary for financial transactions and access to social welfare.
- Three months ago Muniya Devi travelled some 35km to the nearest town to submit the forms and papers necessary to get her family's ration cards linked to Aadhaar.
- People at the office demanded a bribe to get the job done, so she paid them 400 rupees, nearly four days of family earnings.
- "They say the network is down, the computer is not working. And I keep borrowing food to feed my family," she told me.
- In Vishnubandh where Muniya Devi lives, the majority of the 282 families are landless. On good days, a meal means rice and a potato and fava beans curry. On bad days, there's nothing. Hunger is a constant companion.
- At least Muniya Devi has company in her misery. The food rations of 60 out of 350 beneficiaries in the village have been discontinued after they failed to link their cards to Aadhaar in time.
- Most of them tell stories about fruitless trips to government offices and paying bribes. The government made the linkage mandatory some two years ago, a move economist and activist Jean Dreze calls "coercive and anti-poor".
- Things came to a head in September when reports emerged that an 11-year-old girl had died of starvation in the state's Simdega district, months after her family stopped getting subsidised food because they failed to link their ration cards to Aadhaar.
- Santoshi Kumari, a school dropout, had gone without food for four days before she had salt and tea. She died a few hours later. A senior official told me that the allegation that she died of starvation "could not be substantiated".
- "There have been half-a-dozen such reported deaths," says Dr Dreze. "We can differ on whether they died of starvation, but the fact is that in all these cases there was no food at home for days because of some Aadhaar-related issue."
- That's not all. Last March, Jharkhand cancelled some 760,000 "fake" food-ration cards. Dr Dreze believes most of them were annulled because they were not linked to Aadhaar, resulting in thousands of people being deprived of food.
- "Investigations are going on to find out why these cards were cancelled," an official told me.
- Under the law, ration shops - there are more than 25,000 such shops distributing more than two million tonnes of subsidised food in Jharkhand - cannot deny supplies to those who are eligible just because they don't have Aadhaar or have failed to link it to their ration cards.
- But the evidence on the ground is mixed as many intended recipients are still being turned away.
- "I admit that in some places there's a problem with our messaging and people are not getting the information that no Aadhaar doesn't mean no food," Jharkhand's top official in charge of food supplies, Amitabh Kaushal, told me.
- "We will have to fix that."
- But critics say the government is speaking with a forked tongue. Dr Dreze says he has video evidence of a senior official telling villagers recently that "without Aadhaar it was not possible to get a ration card", effectively cutting off access to subsidised food.
- Mr Kaushal insists, though, that the number of people not getting access to subsidised food is paltry. "What you are seeing are the rarest of the rare cases," he says.
- He says the ration cards of more than 80% of the 26 million beneficiaries of subsidised food in the state have already been linked to Aadhaar. More importantly, he says, 99% of beneficiary households have been linked to the number, meaning that at least one member of the family has access to cheap food.
- Dr Dreze says that the high linkage rates are "not surprising after you've cancelled so many ration cards not linked to Aadhaar in the first place".
- Mr Kaushal also denies the allegation that ration shops are turning away a large number of beneficiaries who are having problems authenticating their thumbprint on hand-held networked machines, which sometimes don't work because of poor internet connections or power cuts.
- In January alone, he says, 800,000 of the 4.7 million "food transactions"  were "offline" - food given away despite Aadhaar-related glitches.
- Many pensioners in Jharkhand are in the same bind. There are some 1.2 million elderly, widowed and disabled people who are eligible for monthly pensions of 600-800 rupees.
- Last year, the government made it mandatory to link pensions to Aadhaar and also struck off 300,000 "fake" pensioners from the list of beneficiaries.
- A study by independent researchers Risabh Malhotra and Anmol Somanchi found that fakes make up a fraction of deleted pensions.
- "In the process," they say, "many genuine pensioners have been excluded." Critics say this has mainly happened because of mistakes made by data operators, resulting in discrepancies in name and age.
- Such errors have led to tragicomic results. Due to absence of birth certificates or mistakes by overworked data operators, residents of entire villages share the New Year Day of different years as their birth date.
- Jama Singh, a wizened old farmer living in Sadwadih village, is unable to qualify for a pension because his Aadhaar card lists his age as 102 years.
- "When we took him to banks to open an account, they told us that their software doesn't allow them to enter a three-digit age. So now officials are telling us to declare him 80 years old and apply for a new Aadhaar," Pachathi Singh, a neighbour, told me.
- "I don't know how old I am, but there are people younger than me here who are getting old age pensions," Jama Singh told me. "Is that fair?"
- In Khunti, some 100km away from Vishnubandh, some 20,000 pension holders - mostly women - have been deleted from the list of beneficiaries because of "faulty linking" with bank accounts, say activists. Rajkumari Devi's pension, for example, stopped last October because she had not linked her bank account to Aadhaar.
- The 84-year-old has spent nearly a month's worth of pension money going to the banks in the nearest town to get the matter fixed. The bank tells her the "money is not coming".  Her savings have dwindled to 73 rupees, and her dignity is broken.
- When her son tells her that he will continue to take care of her, Rajkumari Devi admonishes him.
- "My money is my money," she says. "Why should I live on your benevolence?"
