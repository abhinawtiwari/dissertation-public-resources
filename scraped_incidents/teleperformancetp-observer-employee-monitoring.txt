- The Guardian reports that French call centre company Teleperformance is to monitor employees working from home using cameras are connected to an AI system that will scan for home-working 'infractions'.
- According to leaked documents, workers will have to explain why they are leaving their desks to avoid being reported for a breach, amongst other requirements.
- The plans led to complaints by trade unions about the 'unreasonable' and 'intrusive' nature of worker virtual monitoring programmes, including their impact on the privacy of those being monitored and their families.
- Teleperformance, which employs over 380,000 people in 34 countries and counts Apple, Amazon and Uber as customers, has since said the remote scans for infractions will not be used in the UK.
- The company has also faced resistance to its workforce monitoring activities and solutions in Albania, Colombia, the US, and other countries.

- Exclusive: Teleperformance, which employs 380,000 people, plans to use specialist webcams to watch staff
- Thousands of staff at one of the world’s biggest call centre companies face being monitored by webcams to check whether they are eating, looking at their phones or leaving their desks while working from home, the Guardian has learned.
- In a sign of potential battles ahead over the surveillance of remote staff after the pandemic, Teleperformance – which employs about 380,000 people in 34 countries and counts dozens of major UK companies and government departments among its clients – has told some staff that specialist webcams will be fitted to check for home-working “infractions”.
- While these will in part be used for team meetings and training, the cameras are also connected to an artificial intelligence system that will randomly scan for breaches of work rules during a shift. If one is detected, a still photo will be sent to a manager and stored for up to 20 days, according to documents sent to staff.
- If workers need to leave their desks, for example to have a drink, they will have to click “break mode” in an app to explain why – for example, “getting water” – to avoid being reported for a breach.
- Eating while on shift is not permitted, staff are told. “If the system detects no keyboard stroke and mouse click, it will show you as idle for that particular duration, and it will be reported to your supervisor. So please avoid hampering your productivity.”
- A training video about the webcam system, seen by the Guardian, says it “monitors and tracks real-time employee behaviour and detects any violations to pre-set business rules, and sends real-time alerts to managers to take corrective actions immediately”.
- The move triggered warnings from unions and MPs about the normalisation of home surveillance by employers as growing numbers of workers move away from being office-based.
- The revelations came to light after some of Teleperformance’s 10,000 UK employees were told that cameras, including the AI-based scanning system, would be installed next month for staff continuing to work from home.
- When approached by the Guardian, the company said the remote scans would not be used in the UK. Webcams for UK staff could not be operated remotely and would only be used for meetings and training, and for scheduled video calls when supervisors would check desks for devices not allowed for data security reasons, such as phones, a spokesperson said.
- Levels of remote scrutiny would be different in other countries, it said.
- While not a household name, the France-based company is one of the world’s biggest suppliers of outsourced phone services, including customer assistance, telemarketing and technical support.
- In Britain its clients include the health and education departments of the UK government, NHS Digital, the Student Loans Company, the RAF and the Royal Navy. The companies it works for include Vodafone, eBay, Aviva, Volkswagen and the Guardian. There is no suggestion any of these were aware of or involved in planning the new surveillance system.
- Teleperformance is understood to be rolling out the full webcam surveillance system in other countries where it operates. The company declined to say whether any of its UK clients use staff based elsewhere who might be subject to the monitoring.
- According to documents and video, at random times during a shift, the webcam system will scan the workspace for breaches, which include “missing from desk”, “detecting an idle user”, “unauthorised mobile phone usage” and another person being in the workspace area.
- The cameras will also be set up with facial recognition so they can detect if someone else is sitting at the desk. Employees are told: “Any breach detected by the AI triggers a real-time alert to the supervisor for further actions.”
- The company literature acknowledges that family or other household members cannot be kept completely away from workspaces, and said managers would not take action if their presence was detected “as long as the people in the background are not directly looking into the screen, or very close to it”. To avoid this, staff are asked to have their screens facing a wall.
- Staff working at night are instructed to ensure their desk has sufficiently strong lighting to ensure the camera can see what is happening.
- Howard Beckett, assistant general secretary of Unite, said the union would “fight legally and industrially to prevent any push to normalise home surveillance”.
- Andy McDonald, the shadow employment rights minister, said that particularly when companies were relying on home-working staff to keep them going, it was wrong to impose “invasive surveillance that will erode their rights to privacy and create a climate of fear and mistrust”.
- After the Guardian asked Teleperformance about UK staff concerns, a senior manager contacted employees to explain that they would not be randomly monitored, adding that it was “extremely disappointing” the media had been alerted and that this was considered gross misconduct. It is not clear why UK staff were initially told to expect the comprehensive surveillance system.
- A spokesperson for Teleperformance said the company wanted to discuss any concerns with workers and that the webcam system was intended “to respond to the overwhelming concerns of isolation, lack of team engagement and support, not seeing anyone from one day to the next, raised by those who are at home”.
- She said: “We absolutely trust them to do their jobs in a professional manner. We are taking very seriously the concerns you raised … as they can be no further from the truth.”
- No staff would be forced to work from home, the spokesperson said, and discussions would take place to reassure them. It was, however, “of utmost importance that our employees work in a secure home office environment to meet our clients’ and their customers’ expectation of a high level of protection when it comes to processing their personal data, including sensitive personal data”, she said.

- System developed by French firm Teleperformance monitors home workers for ‘breaches’
- For anyone concerned that an era of home working could also become one of remote surveillance, the training video for Teleperformance’s in-house webcam security system, called TP Observer, is the stuff of bad dreams.
- Explained by “Anna”, a desk-sitting avatar complete with an artificial voice, the video introduces TP Observer as “a risk-mitigation tool that monitors and tracks real time employee behaviour, and detects any violations to pre-set business rules”.
- Anna explains that this means home workers will have an AI-enabled webcam added to their computers that recognises their face, tags their location and scans for “breaches” of rules at random points during a shift.
- These include an “unknown person” detected at the desk via the facial recognition software, “missing from desk”, “detecting an idle user” and “unauthorised mobile phone usage”.
- Anna says: “Any breach detected by the AI triggers a real-time alert to the supervisor for further actions.” This means a still photo is snapped and sent to a manager.
- The video includes a series of avatar-staff asking questions, including one who asks whether the system is “a breach of my privacy at home”. The manager tells him the scanning is needed to “help us with risk mitigation and data security, which is required by most of our customers”.
- Another digital employee asks if they will get into trouble if children or other family members approach their home workplace. Not “as long as the people in the background are not directly looking into the screen, or very close to it”. Anna replies. Staff should sit with a wall behind them “to avoid such breaches”, she says. Strong lights should be used for night shifts, so the camera can see properly.
- Teleperformance said the system would not be used for UK staff, but it is expected to be used in a number of 30-plus other countries where the French-based multinational operates and where labour laws are less strict.

- Working from home can make it feel like managers have less direct supervision over workers. But an always-on video-conference tool changes that by automatically snapping webcam pictures of employees every few minutes.
- Companies across the world have been forced to abandon offices in favor of working from home in recent weeks to try to slow the spread of coronavirus, which has sickened more than 39,000 people in the US alone.
- In order to keep productivity high while working remotely, some companies are turning to tools like Sneek. The software features a "wall of faces" for each office, which stays on throughout the workday and features constantly-updating photos of workers taken through their laptop camera every one to five minutes.
- Sneek's user base has rapidly expanded in recent weeks as companies transition en masse to work-from home — signups have increased tenfold in in the past few weeks, cofounder Del Currie told Business Insider. It has over 10,000 users and boasts clients including Fred Perry and GoFish digital.
- The software's interface lets people set their webcam to automatically photograph them every one or five minutes, depending on how frequently they want their image to update (or how frequently their boss requires it).
- If a coworker clicks on their face, Sneek's default settings will instantly connect the two workers in a live video call, even if the recipient hasn't clicked "accept." However, people can also configure their settings to only accept calls manually — and only take webcam photos manually — if their employer allows it.
- Currie told Business Insider that, while some may be put off by the software's interface, it's meant to build a connected office dynamic.
- "Sneek was never designed to spy on anyone, we'd be the worst spy company ever considering we named our app 'Sneek,'" Currie said. "We know lots of people will find it an invasion of privacy, we 100% get that, and it's not the solution for those folks, but there's also lots of teams out there who are good friends and want to stay connected when they're working together."
- After Sneek's interface was reported by The Information's Priya Anand last week, some were turned off by the workplace surveillance tool. David Heinemeier Hansson, CTO and cofounder of the development firm Basecamp, tweeted that the idea "makes my skin crawl."
- Currie acknowledged that the company "did indeed get some Twitter fame last week" after The Information story was published. Sneek was inspired in part by a book on remote work that Hansson co-authored, Currie said, but now the company has received messages from Hansson's followers "abusing our staff and calling us pieces of s—."
- The purpose of Sneek isn't surveillance, Currie said, but office culture.
- "We've worked from home for 10+ years and one of the biggest things that starts to creep in is that sense of isolation, it does really affect people's mental health," he said. "Just having that ability to look up and see your teammates there can make all the difference."

- Hoofdpagina » Wanneer uw baas Big Brother wordt: slimme webcams om ‘luie thuiswerkers’ in de gaten te houden
- Teleperformance – een Franse multinational dat diensten als callcenters en dergelijke aanbiedt – gaat speciale webcams installeren om te controleren of zijn telefonisten die thuiswerken geen inbreuken begaan, zoals een broodje eten of op hun gsm kijken tijdens het werk.
- Het bedrijf heeft bijna 400.000 werknemers wereldwijd, en verzorgt de telefonie van veel overheidsdiensten van verschillende landen. Nu veel van de operators van thuis uit werken, wil het bedrijf zich ervan verzekeren dat hun volledige aandacht naar hun job gaat. Het bedrijf gaat speciale camera’s installeren die uitgerust zijn om te monitoren op ‘telewerkinbreuken’. Zo zullen de camera’s registreren wanneer personeelsleden bijvoorbeeld hun bureau verlaten zonder toestemming en dat in realtime melden aan het management. Dat schrijft de Britse krant The Guardian.
- Het personeel werd gezegd dat ze in de digitale werkomgeving moeten aangeven dat ze in pauze gaan, telkens ze hun bureau verlaten. Daarbij moeten ze ook een reden voor de pauze aanduiden. Eten is niet toegestaan tijdens de shift, en volgens de bronnen van The Guardian zijn de camera’s ook uitgerust met gezichtsherkenningssoftware die oppikt wanneer er iemand anders voor het scherm plaatsneemt.
- De Britse krant heeft ook een interne memo te pakken gekregen waarin het volgende stond: ‘Als het systeem geen toetsenbordslag of muisklik detecteert, wordt u gezien als inactief gedurende die periode, en dat wordt ook zo aan uw leidinggevende gesignaleerd. Zorg er dus voor dat u uw productiviteit niet belemmert.’
- Britse vakbonden, de multinational is erg actief in het Verenigde Koninkrijk, hebben al aangegeven dat soort van ‘home surveillance’ met alle middelen te bestrijden.
- In een reactie lijkt Teleperformance aan te geven dat het systeem er komt op vraag van de thuiswerkers zelf. Volgens het bedrijf is het namelijk een reactie ‘op de overweldigende bezorgdheden omtrent isolatie, gebrek aan betrokkenheid met het team, en het lange tijd zonder collega’s zitten, opgeworpen door degenen die thuis zijn’.

- A major call centre company has refuted claims that specialist webcams will be fitted to check up on employees while they are working from home.
- According to an investigation by the Guardian newspaper, French company Teleperformance had informed employees that the cameras are connected to an artificial intelligence system that can scan for and detect “infractions” such as looking at their phones or eating. It claims that if workers need to leave their desks, they will need to click on “break mode” in the system and give a reason in order to avoid being reported for a breach.
- How to protect against issues arising from employee email and internet use
- Policy on mobile telephone use
- The system is called TP Observer, and can be programmed to take photos every time a breach of pre-set rules is detected. This could include an ‘unknown person’ sitting at the desk (facial recognition software knows who should be there), a period where there have been no keystrokes or unauthorised mobile phone usage.
- Teleperformance operates in 34 countries and employs around 380,000 people. According to a spokesperson, 85% of the UK workforce (or 8,000 employees) are currently working from home.
- The spokesperson said the claims raised by the newspaper were not true, adding: “We absolutely trust [staff] to do their jobs in a professional manner. It is important to reaffirm that regardless of the new technologies, tools and third-party providers that are being used, our work-at-home tools and processes ensure that the processing of our employees data complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable regulations.”
- The webcam would purely be used for collaboration purposes in the UK and South Africa, and “at no time will we be using the tools to spy on our staff”.
- “Use for collaboration purposes means use for meetings and training sessions and for scheduled video calls between team managers and work-at-home employees and voluntary use by our work-at-home staff in team-building activities, to embrace the social aspect of online work, to connect with coworkers, and to promote healthier working environments,” they said.
- “Use for security purposes means use of webcams to ensure that employees who are processing personal and sensitive personal data of customers on behalf of clients maintain an adequate level of security, as well as a clean desk policy, in line with our office environment. Such monitoring will only be carried out on an intermittent or random basis and not over the entire employee shift.  It will always take place with the employee’s knowledge and at no time be used to conduct covert surveillance on our people.”
- The Guardian had reported that around 10,000 staff in the UK were told last week that the cameras and scanning system would be installed next month while they continued to work from home. Teleperformance’s UK clients include NHS Digital, the Student Loans Company and Vodafone.
- Last week the TUC called for new legislation to address “huge gaps” in protection for employees in the use of artificial intelligence at work.
- The union body warned that without fair rules, the use of AI at work “could lead to widespread discrimination and unfair treatment” and workers could even be subject to being “hired and fired by algorithm”.

- Huge call centre company announces plans to closely monitor workers at home
- Global call centre company Teleperformance has alerted employees in the U.K. that it will use webcams to monitor workers who work from home.
- The company has told some staff that it will install specialist webcams to check if remote workers are violating rules. The cameras are connected to an artificial intelligence system (ANI) that will randomly scan for breaches of work rules during a shift, according to the Guardian.
- The webcam system “monitors and tracks real-time employee behaviour and detects any violations to pre-set business rules, and sends real-time alerts to managers to take corrective actions immediately,” according to the report.
- A still photo of the breach will be sent to a manager and the file will be stored up to 20 days. Possible breaches include “missing from desk,” “detecting an idle user,” “unauthorized mobile phone usage” and another person being in the workspace area.
- In January, Albania’s information and data protection commissioner released a decision stating that Teleperformance could not use webcams to spy on Albanian workers in their homes.
- The finding came after workers’ union Solidariteti filed a complaint against the invasive practice of camera surveillance late in 2020, says UNI Global Union in the U.K. After Teleperformance went to a work-from-home model due to the pandemic, it installed webcams in Albania but some management and workers protested against the move.
- “Working from home does not mean working without rights, and the use of technology to monitor workers should be regulated by governments and collectively bargained with unions to protect workers’ privacy,” said Christy Hoffman, general secretary of UNI Global Union.
- “Unfortunately, Teleperformance continues to steamroll workers’ rights and refuses to negotiate with its unions.”
- The use of video surveillance by employers in the workplace has been a contentious issue for decades, says one legal expert, in addressing what’s allowed by employers in Canada.
- Emerging surveillance technologies designed to help employers monitor the productivity of staff are largely viewed by the public as unreasonable and intrusive, according to a University of British Columbia study released in 2020.
- Technologies that aim to capture the physical activity of employees, such as cameras and movement trackers, are viewed as slightly more intrusive than digital footprint technologies, such as email AI analysis, despite the latter collecting more useful information from a productivity standpoint.
- Also, the surveillance is not associated with workers’ work productivity and task achievements, but is more about monitoring them or their bodies in the environment, says “An Empirical Assessment of the Intrusiveness and Reasonableness of Emerging Work Surveillance Technologies in the Public Sector.”
- “Ultimately we hope employers — particularly in the public sector — take a proactive approach to engaging with employees in advance of introducing these technologies, and work with public sector unions or professional associations to make the argument for why a technology should be used,” said Carey Doberstein, an assistant professor of political science at UBC who co-authored the study.
- “If they can come to a joint understanding of what is appropriate and what is not, workplace complaints and legal proceedings over privacy invasions will be less frequent and less likely to disrupt morale.”
- Many (90 per cent) employees working from home are open to their employer having visibility into their daily productivity, according to a recent U.S. survey.

- Contact centre giant Teleperformance, whose clients include Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, VW, Dell, HP and Philips, has been flayed over plans to snoop on staff working from home, amid claims the firm will check workers have their noses to the grindstone rather than their feet up.

The company, which employs 380,000 people in 34 countries, has told some staff that specialist webcams will be fitted to check for home-working “infractions”.
- While these will also be used for team meetings and training, the cameras are connected to an artificial intelligence system that will randomly scan for breaches of work rules during a shift. If one is detected, a still photo will be sent to a manager and stored for up to 20 days, according to documents sent to staff and seen by The Guardian – which ironically is also a Teleperformance client.
- If workers need to leave their desks, for example to have a drink, they will have to click “break mode” in an app to explain why – for example, “getting water” – to avoid being reported for a breach.
- Meanwhile, eating while working is also banned, staff are told. “If the system detects no keyboard stroke and mouse click, it will show you as idle for that particular duration, and it will be reported to your supervisor. So please avoid hampering your productivity.”
- A training video about the webcam system, seen by The Guardian, says it “monitors and tracks real-time employee behaviour and detects any violations to pre-set business rules, and sends real-time alerts to managers to take corrective actions immediately”.
- Some of Teleperformance’s 10,000 UK staff were told that cameras would be installed next month for staff continuing to work from home; the company has since said the remote scans will not be used in this country.
- It insists that webcams for UK staff cannot be operated remotely and would only be used for meetings and training, and for scheduled video calls when supervisors would check desks for devices not allowed for data security reasons, such as mobile phones.
- Howard Beckett, assistant general secretary of Unite, told The Guardian that the union would “fight legally and industrially to prevent any push to normalise home surveillance”.
- Earlier this year, the Information Commissioner’s Office was forced to bow to pressure over the rise of workforce snooping by confirming that it will update its Employment Practices Code to develop new guidance.
- This move followed calls by the Labour Party and trade union bosses for stronger regulation of the technology, amid claims that firms are using coronavirus as a cover to snoop on workers and unfairly punish those deemed to be slacking.
- The TUC has cited research which shows that one in five companies has admitted that they have either installed the technology to snoop on staff already or are planning to.

- This article was produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute.
- The future of work is here, ushered in by a global pandemic. But is it turning employment into a Worker's Paradise of working at home? Or more of a Big Brother panopticon?
- Disturbing increases in the use of digital surveillance technologies by employers to monitor their remote workers are raising alarm bells. With the number of remote workers surging as a result of the pandemic—42 percent of U.S. workers are now doing their jobs from their kitchens, living rooms, and home offices—a number of employers have begun requiring their workers to download spying software to their laptops and smartphones. The goal is for businesses to monitor what their remote employees do all day, to track job performance and productivity, and to reduce so-called "cyber-slacking."
- Business software products from Hubstaff, which tracks a worker's mouse movements, keyboard strokes, webpages visited, email, file transfers and applications used, are surging in sales. So are sales for TSheets, which workers download to their smartphones so that employers can track their location. Another product, called Time Doctor, "downloads videos of employees' screens" and uses "a computer's webcam to take a picture of the employee every 10 minutes," NPR reports. One employee told NPR, "If you're idle for a few minutes, if you go to the bathroom or… [to the kitchen], a pop-up will come up and it'll say, 'You have 60 seconds to start working again or we're going to pause your time.'"
- Another system, InterGuard, can be secretly installed on workers' computers. The Washington Post reports that it "creates a minute-by-minute timeline of every app and website they view, categorizing each as 'productive' or 'unproductive' and ranking workers by their 'productivity score.'" Other employers are using a lower-tech approach, requiring workers to stay logged in to a teleconference service like Zoom all day so they can be continually watched.
- Since the COVID-19 outbreak, one surveillance company, Awareness Technologies, says it has seen its sales triple. Executives at Hubstaffand Teramind also say demand for their companies' monitoring products has tripled. One website showing "Employee Monitoring Software in the USA" lists nearly 70 companies with products for sale.
- Outdated laws keep it legal
- Despite this surge in online surveillance activity, currently, it is a legal practice in the United States. Individual state laws vary over whether companies must inform workers that they're using tracking software, but in reality, "When you're on your office computer, you have no privacy at all," says Lewis Maltby, president of the National Workrights Institute. "Anything and everything you do is probably monitored by your boss."
- Current laws are vastly outdated, as they are based on the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, when the primary form of electronic communication was the telephone. That was a distant time when desktop computers were first becoming popular, and smartphones were not yet a glint in Steve Jobs' eye.
- And now, in response to the coronavirus outbreak, companies such as Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Salesforce have developed intrusive applications that enable companies to continuously track the health status of their employees. Often they include a system for tracking contacts between employees within an office, and a mobile app for collecting information about their health status. A number of large U.S. employers, including Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot and Starbucks, are taking the temperatures of their employees before they are allowed to work. Certainly, employers have a legitimate need to collect the necessary data to safeguard their workplaces, especially in response to a pandemic. But what is the appropriate level of "health intrusion"? How voluntary is the participation of workers, and who gets to decide?
- The reality of this constant Big Brother digital spying in people's homes is that dozens of remote workers are starting to complain that they feel burned out by this pressure. A recent Fishbowl survey of major companies' employees found that three-quarters of those polled were opposed to using "an app or device that allows their company to trace their contacts with colleagues." Yet many fear they will be branded as a troublemaker or lose their job if they speak out. And since remote workers hardly see each other—and increasingly may not even know many of their coworkers—these factors will make labor organizing and collective worker empowerment increasingly challenging.
- U.S. labor unions have been slow to advocate for updating these outdated laws. One union, the United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America, has been working to blunt the worst of the abuses. Labor-friendly media have been missing this story as well. Not only should unions advocate to update the laws and limit digital spying, but why not also demand that home-based workers be compensated by employers for use of their house, utilities and the internet? And that the employer remains responsible to provide equipment and a safe workplace, even in the home?
- Remote workforce growth — the new normal?
- As the number of remote workers rises, concerns are growing among labor advocates that this is quickly becoming the "new normal." One survey by Gartner, Inc. found that 74 percent of companies intend to keep some proportion of their workforce on permanent remote status, with nearly a quarter of respondents saying they will move at least 20 percent of their on-site employees to permanent remote status. Google/Alphabet recently announced it will keep its 200,000 full-time and contract employees home until at least July 2021, and half of Facebook employees will work from home over the next decade. Hub International, a global insurance brokerage, has shifted 90 percent of its 12,000 employees to remote status. "Teleperformance, the world's largest call-center company, estimates that around 150,000 of its employees [nearly half its global workforce] will not return to a physical worksite," according to Social Europe.
- Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom says:
- "A recent separate survey of firms from the Survey of Business Uncertainty that I run with the Atlanta Federal Reserve and the University of Chicago indicated that the share of working days spent at home is expected to increase fourfold from pre-COVID levels, from 5 percent to 20 percent.
- "Of the dozens of firms I have talked to, the typical plan is that employees will work from home one to three days a week, and come into the office the rest of the time."
- But not all at-home workers are created equal. Bloom continues:
- "Taken together, this is generating a time bomb for inequality. Our results show that more educated, higher-earning employees are far more likely to work from home—so they are continuing to get paid, develop their skills and advance their careers. At the same time, those unable to work from home—either because of the nature of their jobs, or because they lack suitable space or internet connections—are being left behind. They face bleak prospects if their skills and work experience erode during an extended shutdown and beyond."
- The future of work has become more uncertain than ever. In this "brave new world," labor unions and advocates must ensure that the pandemic is not misused by businesses as an excuse to worsen conditions for employees who work out of the office. It is easy to imagine how the lines between 'remote' work and 'platform' work could blur, leading to more 'Uberization' as work devolves into 'independent' contracts, bogus self-employment and 'pay-by-project' arrangements that can be easily outsourced to remote (and lower-cost) destinations.
- Worker advocates must push for a strong and modern legal data protection framework. And that should include an effective enforcement system against privacy abuse that disincentivizes illegal spying behavior. Remote work should not become a downward slide toward a Big Brother panopticon that penetrates into society ever more deeply, including into our homes.

- Colombia-based call center workers who provide outsourced customer service to some of the nation’s largest companies are being pressured to sign a contract that lets their employer install cameras in their homes to monitor work performance, an NBC News investigation has found.
- Six workers based in Colombia for Teleperformance, one of the world’s largest call center companies, which counts Apple, Amazon and Uber among its clients, said that they are concerned about the new contract, first issued in March. The contract allows monitoring by AI-powered cameras in workers’ homes, voice analytics and storage of data collected from the worker’s family members, including minors. Teleperformance employs more than 380,000 workers globally, including 39,000 workers in Colombia.
- “The contract allows constant monitoring of what we are doing, but also our family,” said a Bogota-based worker on the Apple account who was not authorized to speak to the news media. “I think it’s really bad. We don’t work in an office. I work in my bedroom. I don’t want to have a camera in my bedroom.”
- The worker said that she signed the contract, a copy of which NBC News has reviewed, because she feared losing her job. She said that she was told by her supervisor that she would be moved off the Apple account if she refused to sign the document. She said the additional surveillance technology has not yet been installed.
- The concerns of the workers, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, highlight a pandemic-related trend that has alarmed privacy and labor experts: As many workers have shifted to performing their duties at home, some companies are pushing for increasing levels of digital monitoring of their staff in an effort to recreate the oversight of the office at home.
- The issue is not isolated to Teleperformance’s workers in Colombia. The company states on its website that it offers similar monitoring through its TP Cloud Campus product, the software it uses to enable staff to work remotely in more than 19 markets. An official Teleperformance promotional video for TP Cloud Campus from January 2021 describes how it uses “AI to monitor clean desk policy and fraud” among its remote workers by analyzing camera feeds. And in its latest earnings statement, released in June, Teleperformance said it has shifted 240,000 of its approximately 380,000 employees to working from home thanks to the TP Cloud Campus product.
- At the end of 2020, workers at Teleperformance in Albania, including those working on the Apple U.K. account, complained to the country’s Information and Data Protection Commissioner about the company’s proposal to introduce video monitoring in their homes. The commissioner later ruled that Teleperformance could not use webcams to monitor Albanian workers in their homes.
- “Surveillance at home has really been normalized in the context of the pandemic,” said Veena Dubal, a labor law professor at the University of California, Hastings. “Companies see a lot of benefit in putting in software to do all kinds of monitoring they would have otherwise expected their human managers to do, but the reality is that it’s much more intrusive than surveillance conducted by a boss.”
- Teleperformance spokesman Mark Pfeiffer said that the company is “constantly looking for ways to enhance the Teleperformance Colombia experience for both our employees and our customers, with privacy and respect as key factors in everything we do.”
- “We are committed to fair practices, equality, inclusion, diversity, non-discrimination, labor sustainability, ethics, and transparency," Pfeiffer said, "and we will continue to do everything we can to uphold these values for both our teams and all our key stakeholders.”
- The contract seeks consent for a wide range of possible scenarios to ensure that Teleperformance complies with data privacy laws as it continues to develop tools to optimize long-term work from home for employees and clients, he said.
- He added Teleperformance has just been certified in Colombia as a Great Place to Work, a third-party certification that’s based on confidential surveys of thousands of employees, for the fourth consecutive year, which, he said, “validated that the vast majority of our employees in Colombia view us favorably as a fair, caring and trustworthy employer, despite the challenging times we are all living in.”
- But it does not appear that this pressure is directly coming from some companies like Apple. Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy said that the company “prohibits the use of video or photographic monitoring by our suppliers and have confirmed Teleperformance does not use video monitoring for any of their teams working with Apple.” Leahy said that Apple had audited Teleperformance in Colombia this year and did not find any “core violations of our strict standards.”
- “We investigate all claims and will continue to ensure everyone across our supply chain is treated with dignity and respect,” he added.
- During the pandemic, Teleperformance, like many other companies, shifted the majority of its employees globally to working from home. At the start, the company faced international scrutiny from labor unions after photos were leaked to news outlets of some of its staff in the Philippines — the country with the highest number of Teleperformance workers — sleeping at work so they could be in the office to respond to Amazon Ring customers in U.S. time zones. At the time, some workers complained about the office conditions and said they wanted the convenience and safety of working at home. There are no signs that workers from Colombia slept at the office.
- However, that convenience and safety appears to have come with a privacy infringing catch, said workers. In March, members of Teleperformance’s global workforce, including 95 percent of its 39,000 Colombian employees who were working remotely, were sent an eight-page addendum to their existing employment contracts that asked them to agree to new home surveillance rules, workers said. Workers said that management told them clients requested the additional monitoring to improve security and prevent any data breaches while they were working from home because of the pandemic.
- The document asks workers to agree to having video cameras installed in their home or on their computers, pointing at their workspace, to record and monitor workers in real time. It also states that workers agree to Teleperformance using AI-powered video analysis tools that can identify objects around the workspace, including mobile phones, paper and other items that are restricted by Teleperformance’s security policies. They must also agree to sharing data and images related to any children they have under the age of 18 — who might get picked up by video and audio monitoring tools — and to sharing biometric data including fingerprints and photos. There is also a clause that requires workers to take polygraph tests if requested.
- Pfeiffer, the Teleperformance spokesperson, said that cameras were used for spot checks of the company’s clean desk policy and occasionally to ensure compliance with data security processes and that no data is recorded from employees. He said that the AI-powered video analysis was currently being tested in just three of Teleperformance’s markets. He said that employees consented to sharing biometric data and that polygraphs are used in specific security studies with employees’ consent. The company acknowledged asking workers to consent to sharing data relating to minors, but said that it did not share this data outside of Teleperformance.
- Unlike Apple, Uber said that it requested monitoring for its workers, but not the entire workforce. Uber spokesperson Lois Van Der Laan said that its customer service agents have access to private and sensitive user information, including credit card details and trip data, and that protecting that information is a priority for Uber. As a result, Uber requested Teleperformance to monitor staff working on its accounts to verify that only a hired employee is accessing the data; that outsourced staff weren’t recording screen data on another device such as a phone; and that no unauthorized person was near the computer. Uber does not require any additional monitoring beyond that, she said.
- The prospect of the level of surveillance at home detailed in the contract, when calls are already closely monitored by software, alarmed some of Teleperformance’s customer service agents.
- One worker on the Amazon account works night shifts from Colombia so she can serve customers in Spain. The only room in her apartment that is quiet enough to take customer calls is the bedroom she shares with her husband. She takes calls from a desk while he sleeps on the bed. She’s worried the microphones might pick up the sound of him snoring, she told NBC News.
- She was required to keep her computer’s camera on during training, but said Teleperformance has not yet installed additional cameras or monitoring in her home.
- “It’s a violation of my privacy rights, and the rights of my husband and mother-in-law who live with me,” she said.
- Amazon spokesperson Alyssa Bronikowski said that Amazon did not request any additional monitoring for at-home workers. “It is not true to say we required or asked for these measures,” she said, adding that Amazon “does not tolerate violations” of its vendor code of conduct, which stipulates that contractors must respect labor rights, including the right to establish or join a union, “and we routinely audit our vendors for compliance.”
- Some Teleperformance workers have become so concerned about the pressure to agree to sweeping surveillance that they have started to organize to improve their working conditions. On Monday they submitted a set of demands to their employer with the Utraclaro y TIC union, which typically organizes workers in the IT sector and has already created a union within the Colombian operations of call center giant Atento, a Teleperformance competitor. The demands include the right to freedom of assembly without fear of retaliation, less intrusive surveillance, overtime pay, 30-second breaks between calls, clearer disciplinary processes and covering the cost of equipment used to work from home, including a chair and desk, as well as a reliable internet connection.
- “We want workers at Teleperformance to have the freedom to join a trade union without fear of losing their jobs,” said Yuli Higuera, president of the union, which has about 1,200 members in Colombia. So far, about 100 Teleperformance workers have joined the union, she said.
- Pfeiffer, the spokesperson, said that the demands submitted by the union were “not all based on practice or facts” and that the company intends to address each one with the union directly. “We value our people and their well being, safety and happiness,” he said. “We are a people-centric business and we will continue to act in good faith regarding all aspects of collective bargaining.”
- The stakes for organizers in Colombia are particularly high, as violence against trade unionists is common and labor protections are weak. From March 2020 to April, 22 trade unionists were killed in Colombia, according to the International Trade Union Confederation’s Global Rights Index 2021. Teleperformance has not been linked to any of this violence.
- “I myself have been threatened with death twice because of my organizing,” said Higuera. “Making a union in Colombia is not easy, but it’s work I have to do and we have the confidence, disposition and faith that we are going to achieve a good outcome with Teleperformance.”
- Higuera’s primary focus is to get Teleperformance to recognize the union and agree to allow workers to organize without facing retaliation. In July, the French National Contact Point to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which acts as a watchdog for responsible multinational businesses on behalf of the OECD, issued a set of recommendations to Teleperformance, which is based in Paris, including that the company should have “respect for the right of freedom of association and collective bargaining of workers.”
- The recommendations came after Teleperformance terminated several Colombian worker organizers in 2020 after they started to organize during the pandemic. The French National Contact Point, or NCP, described the dismissals as “akin to anti-union practices.”
- Teleperformance’s Pfeiffer said that the NCP process referred to just 9 cases out of almost 39,000 employees and that it found no evidence that Teleperformance was engaging in systematic anti-union activities. Teleperformance Colombia complies with local labor law and international labor guidelines, he said. “We welcome the NCP’s recommendations for enhancing our approach,” Pfeiffer said. “We are fully committed to the workers’ right to organize.”
- The workers’ concerns over surveillance builds on reporting by The Guardian, which detailed, based on documents sent to staff, how Teleperformance planned to use specialist webcams connected to an artificial intelligence system that would scan live video for breaches of work rules during the work shift and, if detected, send a still photo of the infraction to a manager.
- According to the report, workers would have to click “break mode” in a company app if they wanted to leave their desks and add an explanation, such as “getting water,” to ensure the system didn’t report them. The system would also detect if the worker had not typed or clicked the mouse and mark the worker as idle during that time.
- Teleperformance said that the remote scans for infractions would not be used in the U.K. and that webcams would only be used for meetings and training. Levels of remote monitoring would be different in other countries, the company said. The company said that the monitoring had been rolled out to India, Mexico and the Philippines.
- Christy Hoffman, global secretary of UNI Global, which supports workers’ rights to unionize across the world and has been coordinating with organizers at Teleperformance, said that the call center industry has been booming during the pandemic. That’s because more work has shifted online and large, U.S.-based companies are increasingly relying on outsourced workers at companies like Teleperformance based in countries like Colombia and the Philippines where labor is cheaper.
- “The shift of workers out of call centers and into people’s homes and the increased monitoring and data capture as a result has really degraded their working conditions,” she said.
- Hoffman called on Teleperformance’s clients such as Apple and Amazon to use their influence to improve the working conditions of their outsourced workers.
- “They are not directly responsible from the point of view of Colombian laws,” she said. “But they have leverage and they ultimately control the conditions for workers who perform duties for their operations.”
