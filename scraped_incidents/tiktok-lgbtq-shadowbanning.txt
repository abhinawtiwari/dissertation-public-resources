- TikTok, and its Chinese counterpart Douyin[3] (Chinese: 抖音; pinyin: Dǒuyīn), is a short-form video hosting service owned by ByteDance.[4] It hosts user-submitted videos, which can range in duration from 3 seconds to 10 minutes.[5]
- Since their launches, TikTok and Douyin have gained global popularity.[6][7] In October 2020, TikTok surpassed 2 billion mobile downloads worldwide.[8][9][10] Morning Consult named TikTok the third-fastest growing brand of 2020, after Zoom and Peacock.[11] Cloudflare ranked TikTok the most popular website of 2021, surpassing google.com.[12]
- Douyin was launched by ByteDance in Beijing, China in September 2016, originally under the name A.me, before rebranding to Douyin (抖音) in December 2016.[13][14] Douyin was developed in 200 days and within a year had 100 million users, with more than one billion videos viewed every day.[15][16]
- Douyin was released in the Chinese market in September 2016.[17] TikTok is an entirely separate,[3] internationalized version of Douyin, and was launched in 2017 for iOS and Android in most markets outside of mainland China; however, it became available worldwide only after merging with another Chinese social media service, Musical.ly, on 2 August 2018.
- TikTok and Douyin have almost the same user interface but no access to each other's content.[3] Their servers are each based in the market where the respective app is available.[18] The two products are similar, but their features are not identical. Douyin includes an in-video search feature that can search by people's faces for more videos of them, along with other features such as buying, booking hotels, and making geo-tagged reviews.[19]
- ByteDance planned on Douyin expanding overseas. The founder of ByteDance, Zhang Yiming, stated that "China is home to only one-fifth of Internet users globally. If we don't expand on a global scale, we are bound to lose to peers eyeing the four-fifths. So, going global is a must."[20]
- The app was launched as TikTok in the international market in September 2017.[21] On 23 January 2018, the TikTok app ranked first among free application downloads on app stores in Thailand and other countries.[22]
- TikTok has been downloaded more than 130 million times in the United States and has reached 2 billion downloads worldwide,[23][24] according to data from mobile research firm Sensor Tower (those numbers exclude Android users in China).[25]
- In the United States, celebrities, including Jimmy Fallon and Tony Hawk, began using the app in 2018.[26][27] Other celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Alba, Will Smith, and Justin Bieber joined TikTok as well as many others.[28]
- In January 2019, TikTok allowed creators to embed merchandise sale links into their videos.[29]
- On 3 September 2019, TikTok and the U.S. National Football League (NFL) announced a multi-year partnership.[30] The agreement occurred just two days before the NFL's 100th season kick-off at Soldier Field, where TikTok hosted activities for fans in honor of the deal. The partnership entails the launch of an official NFL TikTok account, which is to bring about new marketing opportunities such as sponsored videos and hashtag challenges. In July 2020, TikTok, excluding Douyin, reported close to 800 million monthly active users worldwide after less than four years of existence.[31]
- In May 2021, TikTok appointed Shou Zi Chew as their new CEO[32] who assumed the position from interim CEO Vanessa Pappas, following the resignation of Kevin A. Mayer on 27 August 2020.[33][34][35] On 3 August 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok in the United States on 15 September if negotiations for the company to be bought by Microsoft or a different American company failed.[36] On 6 August, Trump signed two executive orders banning U.S. "transactions" with TikTok and WeChat to its respective parent companies ByteDance and Tencent, set to take effect 45 days after the signing.[37] A planned ban of the app on 20 September 2020[38][39] was postponed by a week and then blocked by a federal judge.[40][41][42][43] President Biden revoked the ban in a new executive order in June 2021.[44] The app has been banned by the government of India since June 2020 along with 223 other Chinese apps in view of privacy concerns.[45] Pakistan banned TikTok citing "immoral" and "indecent" videos on 9 October 2020 but reversed its ban ten days later.[46][47][48] In March 2021, a Pakistani court ordered a new TikTok ban due to complaints over "indecent" content.
- In September 2021, TikTok reported that it had reached 1 billion users.[49] In 2021, TikTok earned $4 billion in advertising revenue.[50]
- In October 2022, TikTok was reported to be planning an expansion into the e-commerce market in the US, following the launch of TikTok Shop in the United Kingdom. The company posted job listings for staff for a series of order fulfillment centers in the US and is reportedly planning to start the new live shopping business before the end of the year.[51]
- According to data from app analytics group Sensor Tower, advertising on TikTok in the US grew by 11% in March 2023, with companies including Pepsi, DoorDash, Amazon and Apple among the top spenders. According to estimates from research group Insider Intelligence, TikTok is projected to generate $14.15 billion in revenue in 2023, up from $9.89 billion in 2022.[52]
- On 9 November 2017, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, spent nearly $1 billion to purchase musical.ly, a startup headquartered in Shanghai with an overseas office in Santa Monica, California, U.S.[53][54] Musical.ly was a social media video platform that allowed users to create short lip-sync and comedy videos, initially released in August 2014. TikTok merged with musical.ly on 2 August 2018 with existing accounts and data consolidated into one app, keeping the title TikTok.[55] This ended musical.ly and made TikTok a worldwide app, excluding China, since China already had Douyin.[54][56][57]
- As of 2018, TikTok was available in more than 150 markets, and in 75 languages.[58][unreliable source?] TikTok was downloaded more than 104 million times on Apple's App Store during the first half of 2018, according to data provided to CNBC by Sensor Tower.[59]
- After merging with musical.ly in August, downloads increased and TikTok became the most downloaded app in the U.S. in October 2018, which musical.ly had done once before.[60][61] In February 2019, TikTok, together with Douyin, hit one billion downloads globally, excluding Android installs in China.[62] In 2019, media outlets cited TikTok as the 7th-most-downloaded mobile app of the decade, from 2010 to 2019.[63] It was also the most-downloaded app on Apple's App Store in 2018 and 2019, surpassing Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.[64][65] In September 2020, a deal was confirmed between ByteDance and Oracle in which the latter will serve as a partner to provide cloud hosting.[66][67] Walmart intends to invest in TikTok.[68] This deal would stall in 2021 as newly elected President Biden's Justice Department put a hold on the previous U.S. ban under President Trump.[69][70][71] In November 2020, TikTok signed a licensing deal with Sony Music.[72] In December 2020, Warner Music Group signed a licensing deal with TikTok.[73][74][75] In April 2021, Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism partnered with TikTok to promote tourism.[76] It came following the January 2021 winter campaign, initiated through a partnership between the UAE Government Media Office partnered and TikTok to promote the country's tourism.[77]
- Since 2014, the first non-gaming apps[78] with more than 3 billion downloads were Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger; all owned by Meta. TikTok was the first non-Facebook app to reach that figure. Sensor Tower reported that although TikTok had been banned in India, its largest market, in June 2020, downloads in the rest of the world continue to increase, reaching 3 billion downloads in 2021.[79]
- The advertising revenue of short video clips is lower than other social media: while users spend more time, American audience is monetized at a rate of $0.31 per hour, a third the rate of Facebook and a fifth the rate of Instagram, $67 per year while Instagram will make more than $200.[80]
- The mobile app allows users to create short videos, which often feature music in the background and can be sped up, slowed down, or edited with a filter.[81] They can also add their own sound on top of the background music. To create a music video with the app, users can choose background music from a wide variety of music genres, edit with a filter and record a 15-second video with speed adjustments before uploading it to share with others on TikTok or other social platforms.[82]
- The "For You" page on TikTok is a feed of videos that are recommended to users based on their activity on the app. Content is curated by TikTok's artificial intelligence depending on the content a user liked, interacted with, or searched. This is in contrast to other social networks' algorithms basing such content off of the user's relationships with other users and what they liked or interacted with.[83]
- The app's "react" feature allows users to film their reaction to a specific video, over which it is placed in a small window that is movable around the screen.[84] Its "duet" feature allows users to film a video aside from another video.[85] The "duet" feature was another trademark of musical.ly. The duet feature is also only able to be used if both parties adjust the privacy settings.[86]
- Videos that users do not want to post yet can be stored in their "drafts". The user is allowed to see their "drafts" and post when they find it fitting.[87]
The app allows users to set their accounts as "private". When first downloading the app, the user's account is public by default. The user can change to private in their settings. Private content remains visible to TikTok but is blocked from TikTok users who the account holder has not authorized to view their content.[88] Users can choose whether any other user, or only their "friends", may interact with them through the app via comments, messages, or "react" or "duet" videos.[84] Users also can set specific videos to either "public", "friends only", or "private" regardless if the account is private or not.[88]
- Users can also send their friends videos, emojis, and messages with direct messaging. TikTok has also included a feature to create a video based on the user's comments. Influencers often use the "live" feature. This feature is only available for those who have at least 1,000 followers and are over 16 years old. If over 18, the user's followers can send virtual "gifts" that can be later exchanged for money.[89][90]
- TikTok announced a "family safety mode" in February 2020 for parents to be able to control their children's presence on the app. There is a screen time management option, restricted mode, and the option to put a limit on direct messages.[91][92] The app expanded its parental controls feature called "Family Pairing" in September 2020 to provide parents and guardians with educational resources to understand what children on TikTok are exposed to. Content for the feature was created in partnership with online safety nonprofit, Internet Matters.[93]
- In October 2021, TikTok launched a test feature that allows users to directly tip certain creators. Accounts of users that are of age, have at least 100,000 followers and agree to the terms can activate a "Tip" button on their profile, which allows followers to tip any amount, starting from $1.[94]
- In December 2021, TikTok started beta-testing Live Studio, a streaming software that would let users broadcast applications open on their computers, including games. The software also launched with support for mobile and PC streaming.[95] However, a few days later, users on Twitter discovered that the software uses code from the open-source OBS Studio. OBS made a statement saying that, under the GNU GPL version 2, TikTok has to make the code of Live Studio publicly available if it wants to use any code from OBS.[96]
- In May 2022, TikTok announced TikTok Pulse, an ad revenue-sharing program. It covers the "top 4% of all videos on TikTok" and is only available to creators with more than 100,000 followers. If an eligible creator's video reaches the top 4%, they will receive a 50% share of the revenue from ads displayed with the video.[97]
- TikTok tends to appeal to younger users, as 41% of its users are between the ages of 16 and 24. These individuals are considered Generation Z.[83] Among these TikTok users, 90% said they used the app daily.[98] TikTok's geographical use has shown that 43% of new users are from India.[99] As of the first quarter of 2022, there were over 100 million monthly active users in the United States and 23 million in the UK. The average user, daily, was spending 1 hour and 25 minutes on the app and opening TikTok 17 times.[100]
- A variety of trends have risen within TikTok, including memes, lip-synced songs, and comedy videos. Duets, a feature that allows users to add their own video to an existing video with the original content's audio, have sparked many of these trends.
- The app has spawned numerous viral trends, Internet celebrities, and music trends around the world.[101] Many stars got their start on musical.ly, which merged with TikTok on 2 August 2018. These include Loren Gray, Baby Ariel, Kristen Hancher, Zach King, Lisa and Lena, Jacob Sartorius, and many others. Loren Gray remained the most-followed individual on TikTok until Charli D'Amelio surpassed her on 25 March 2020. Gray's was the first TikTok account to reach 40 million followers on the platform. She was surpassed with 41.3 million followers. D'Amelio was the first to ever reach 50, 60, and 70 million followers. Charli D'Amelio remained the most-followed individual on the platform until she was surpassed by Khaby Lame on June 23, 2022. Other creators rose to fame after the platform merged with musical.ly on 2 August 2018.[102] TikTok also played a major part in making "Old Town Road" by Lil Nas X one of the biggest songs of 2019 and the longest-running number-one song in the history of the US Billboard Hot 100.[103][104][105]
- TikTok has allowed many music artists to gain a wider audience, often including foreign fans. For example, despite never having toured in Asia, the band Fitz and the Tantrums developed a large following in South Korea following the widespread popularity of their 2016 song "HandClap" on the platform.[106] "Any Song" by R&B and rap artist Zico became number one on the Korean music charts due to the popularity of the #anysongchallenge, where users dance to the choreography of the song.[107] The platform has also launched many songs that failed to garner initial commercial success into sleeper hits, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.[108][109] However, it has received criticism for not paying royalties to artists whose music is used on the platform.[110]
- In June 2020, TikTok users and K-pop fans "claimed to have registered potentially hundreds of thousands of tickets" for President Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa through communication on TikTok,[111] contributing to "rows of empty seats"[112] at the event. Later, in October 2020, an organization called TikTok for Biden was created to support then-presidential candidate Joe Biden.[113] After the election, the organization was renamed to Gen-Z for Change.[114][115]
- TikTok has banned Holocaust denial, but other conspiracy theories have become popular on the platform, such as Pizzagate and QAnon (two conspiracy theories popular among the U.S. alt-right) whose hashtags reached almost 80 million views and 50 million views respectively by June 2020.[116] The platform has also been used to spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic, such as clips from Plandemic.[116] TikTok removed some of these videos and has generally added links to accurate COVID-19 information on videos with tags related to the pandemic.[117]
- On 10 August 2020, Emily Jacobssen wrote and sang "Ode to Remy", a song praising the protagonist from Pixar's 2007 computer-animated film Ratatouille. The song rose to popularity when musician Daniel Mertzlufft composed a backing track to the song. In response, began creating a "crowdsourced" project called Ratatouille the Musical. Since Mertzlufft's video, many new elements including costume design, additional songs, and a playbill have been created.[118] On 1 January 2021, a full one-hour virtual presentation of Ratatouille the Musical premiered on TodayTix. It starred Titus Burgess as Remy, Wayne Brady as Django, Adam Lambert as Emile, Kevin Chamberlin as Gusteau, Andrew Barth Feldman as Linguini, Ashley Park as Colette, Priscilla Lopez as Mabel, Mary Testa as Skinner, and André De Shields as Ego.
- On Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, some celebrities who had garnered large followings as of August 2019 include Dilraba Dilmurat, Angelababy, Luo Zhixiang, Ouyang Nana, and Pan Changjiang.[119] In the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a Qatari teenage royal became an internet celebrity after his angry expressions were recorded in Qatar's opening match loss to Ecuador;[120] he amassed more than 15 million followers in less than a week after creating a Douyin account.[121]
- Content promoting cosmetic surgery is popular on TikTok and has spawned several viral trends on the platform. In December 2021, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, published an article about the popularity of some plastic surgeons on TikTok. In the article, it was noted that plastic surgeons were some of the earliest adopters of social media in the medical field and many had been recognised as influencers on the platform. The article published stats about the most popular plastic surgeons on TikTok up to February 2021 and at the time, five different plastic surgeons had surpassed 1 million followers on the platform.[122][123]
- In 2021, it was reported that a trend known as the #NoseJobCheck trend was going viral on TikTok. TikTok content creators used a specific audio on their videos while showing how their noses looked before and after having their rhinoplasty surgeries. By January 2021, the hashtag #nosejob had accumulated 1.6 billion views, #nosejobcheck had accumulated 1 billion views, and the audio used in the #NoseJobCheck trend had been used in 120,000 videos.[124] In 2020, Charli D'Amelio, the most-followed person on TikTok at the time, also made a #NoseJobCheck video to show the results of her surgery to repair her previously broken nose.[125]
- In April 2022, NBC News reported that surgeons were giving influencers on the platform discounted or free cosmetic surgeries in order to advertise the procedures to their audiences. They also reported that facilities that offered these surgeries were also posting about them on TikTok. TikTok has banned the advertising of cosmetic surgeries on the platform but cosmetic surgeons are still able to reach large audiences using unpaid photo and video posts. NBC reported that videos using the hashtags '#plasticsurgery' and '#lipfiller' had amassed a combined 26 billion views on the platform.[126]
- In December 2022, it was reported that a cosmetic surgery procedure known as buccal fat removal was going viral on the platform. The procedure involves surgically removing fat from the cheeks in order to give the face a slimmer and more chiseled appearance. Videos using hashtags related to buccal fat removal had collectively amassed over 180 million views. Some TikTok users criticised the trend for promoting an unobtainable beauty standard.[127][128][129]
- TikTok has provided a platform for users to create content not only for fun but also for money. As the platform has grown significantly over the past few years, it has allowed companies to advertise and rapidly reach their intended demographic through influencer marketing.[130] The platform's AI algorithm also contributes to the influencer marketing potential, as it picks out content according to the user's preference.[131] Sponsored content is not as prevalent on the platform as it is on other social media apps, but brands and influencers still can make as much as they would if not more in comparison to other platforms.[131] Influencers on the platform who earn money through engagement, such as likes and comments, are referred to as "meme machines".[130]
- In 2021, The New York Times reported that viral TikTok videos by young people relating the emotional impact of books on them, tagged with the label "BookTok", significantly drove sales of literature. Publishers were increasingly using the platform as a venue for influencer marketing.[132]
- In 2022, NBC News reported in a television segment that some TikTok and YouTube influencers were being given free and discounted cosmetic surgeries in order for them to advertise the surgeries to users of the platforms.[133]
- In 2022, it was reported that a trend called "de-influencing" had become popular on the platform as a backlash to influencer marketing. TikTok creators participating in this trend made videos criticising products promoted by influencers and asked their audiences not to buy products they did not need. However, some creators participating in the trend started promoting alternative products to their audiences and earning commission from sales made through their affiliate links in the same manner as the influencers they were originally criticising.[134][135]
- In October 2020, the e-commerce platform Shopify added TikTok to its portfolio of social media platforms, allowing online merchants to sell their products directly to consumers on TikTok.[136]
- Some small businesses have used TikTok to advertise and to reach an audience wider than the geographical region they would normally serve. The viral response to many small business TikTok videos has been attributed to TikTok's algorithm, which shows content that viewers at large are drawn to, but which they are unlikely to actively search for (such as videos on unconventional types of businesses, like beekeeping and logging).[137]
- In 2020, digital media companies such as Group Nine Media and Global used TikTok increasingly, focusing on tactics such as brokering partnerships with TikTok influencers and developing branded content campaigns.[138] Notable collaborations between larger brands and top TikTok influencers have included Chipotle's partnership with David Dobrik in May 2019[139] and Dunkin' Donuts' partnership with Charli D'Amelio in September 2020.[140]
- TikTok is regularly used by sex workers to promote pornographic content sold on platforms such as OnlyFans.[141] In 2020, the use of the term "accountant" to refer to adult content creators became widespread after a user posted a viral song on the platform about how it was easier for him to tell people he was an accountant instead of a pornographic actor.[142] In response, TikTok updated their terms of service to ban content that promotes "premium sexual content" and banned a large number of adult content creators, but these creators have used various methods to evade censorship.[143] Methods used by adult content creators to avoid censorship include referring to themselves as accountants, using substitutes for words in their captions and videos  – such as using the corn emoji in place of the word "porn", and "n00ds" instead of "nudes  – and using filters to censor their explicit images.[144][145] Some adult creators have also gone viral for posting videos with unsolvable riddles in them. These riddles attracted large numbers of comments by people trying and failing to solve the riddles, which in turn caused TikTok's recommendation algorithm to recommend them to more people as it perceived them as popular videos.[146]
- Popular TikTok users have lived collectively in collab houses, predominantly in the Los Angeles area.[147]
- As of January 2023[update], TikTok is reportedly banned in several Asian countries including Afghanistan,[148] Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh,[149][150] India,[151][152][153] Iran,[154] Pakistan,[155] and Syria. The app was previously banned temporarily in Indonesia[156] and Jordan,[157] though both have been lifted since.

The network is also reportedly considering a ban on the app.[164]
- On 6 August 2020, then U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order[165][166] which would ban TikTok transactions in 45 days if it was not sold by ByteDance. Trump also signed a similar order against the WeChat application owned by the Chinese multinational company Tencent.[167][39]
- On 14 August 2020, Trump issued another order[168][169] giving ByteDance 90 days to sell or spin off its U.S. TikTok business.[170] In the order, Trump said that there is "credible evidence" that leads him to believe that ByteDance "might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States."[171] Donald Trump was concerned about TikTok being a threat because TikTok's parent company was rumored to be taking United States user data and reporting it back to Chinese operations through the company ByteDance.[172]
- In June 2021, new president Joe Biden signed an executive order revoking the Trump administration ban on TikTok, and instead ordered the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the app to determine if it poses a threat to U.S. national security.[173]
- In June 2022, reports emerged that ByteDance employees in China could access US data and repeatedly accessed the private information of TikTok users,[174][175][176] TikTok employees were cited saying that "everything is seen in China", while one director claimed a Beijing-based engineer referred to as a "Master Admin" has "access to everything".[174][177][178]
- Following the reports, TikTok announced that 100% of its US user traffic is now being routed to Oracle Cloud, along with their intention to delete all US user data from their own data centers.[175][177] This deal stems from the talks with Oracle instigated in September 2020 in the midst of Trump's threat to ban TikTok in the US.[179][180][178]
- In June 2022, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr called for Google and Apple to remove TikTok from their app stores, citing national security concerns, saying TikTok "harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show are being accessed in Beijing."[181][174]
- In October 2022, a Forbes report claimed that the ByteDance team planned to surveil individual American citizens for undisclosed reasons. TikTok denied these claims in a series of tweets, saying that this report lacked "both rigor and journalistic integrity".[182][183]
- In November 2022, Christopher A. Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told U.S. lawmakers that "the Chinese government could use [TikTok] to control data collection on millions of users or control the recommendation algorithm, which could be used for influence operations."[184]
- In December 2022, Senator Marco Rubio and representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced the Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party Act (ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act), which would prohibit Chinese- and Russian-owned social networks from doing business in the United States.[185][186] That month, Senator Josh Hawley also introduced a separate measure, the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, to ban federal employees from using TikTok on all government devices.[187] On December 15, Hawley's measure was unanimously passed by the U.S. Senate.[188] On December 27, the Chief Administrative Officer of the United States House of Representatives banned TikTok from all devices managed by the House of Representatives.[189]
- As of February 2023,[190][191] at least 32 (of 50) states have announced or enacted bans on state government agencies, employees, and contractors using TikTok on government-issued devices. State bans only affect government employees and do not prohibit civilians from having or using the app on their personal devices.
- In March 2023, Politico reported that TikTok hired SKDK to lobby amid a possible federal ban.[192]
- The same month TikTok's CEO appeared before Congress to address the concerns surrounding the app. He stated that TikTok's data collection practices did not differ from those of US social media platforms.[193]
- A ban of TikTok in the United States has been referred to as hypocrisy because of the similar spying of users of US social networks done by the NSA with the PRISM surveillance program.[194]
- Montana became the first state to pass legislation banning TikTok on all personal devices from operating within state lines and barring app stores from offering TikTok for downloads.[195][196][197] State governor Greg Gianforte signed the bill in May 2023 with the law going into effect in January 2024.[195][196][198] A lawsuit was filed against the state shortly after the bill was signed by content creators of the app in Montana.[199][200]
- By 7 March 2023, 68 Australian federal agencies had banned TikTok on work-related mobile devices. Liberal Party Senator James Paterson called for a federal ban on all government-related devices.[201] In April, West Australian Premier Mark McGowan banned TikTok from government phones.[202]
- On 17 March 2023, the New Zealand Parliamentary Service banned TikTok on devices connected to Parliament, citing cybersecurity concerns.[203][204]
- There are concerns that some users may find it hard to stop using TikTok.[205] In April 2018, an addiction-reduction feature was added to Douyin.[205] This encouraged users to take a break every 90 minutes.[205] Later in 2018, the feature was rolled out to the TikTok app. TikTok uses some top influencers such as Gabe Erwin, Alan Chikin Chow, James Henry, and Cosette Rinab to encourage viewers to stop using the app and take a break.[206]
- Many were also concerned with the app affecting users' attention spans due to the short-form nature of the content. This is a concern as many of TikTok's audience are younger children, whose brains are still developing.[207] TikTok executives and representatives have noted and made aware to advertisers on the platform that users have poor attention spans. With a large amount of video content, nearly 50% of users find it stressful to watch a video longer than a minute and a third of users watch videos at double speed.[100] TikTok has also received criticism for enabling children to purchase coins which they can send to other users.[208]
- In June 2022, TikTok introduced the ability to set a maximum uninterrupted screen time allowance, after which the app blocks off the ability to navigate the feed. The block only lifts after the app is exited and left unused for a set period of time. Additionally, the app features a dashboard with statistics on how often the app is opened, how much time is spent browsing it and when the browsing occurs.[209]
- In April 2023, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that TikTok faces multiple lawsuits pertaining to content related to suicide and self-harm.[210]
- Some countries have shown concerns regarding the content on TikTok, as their cultures view it as obscene, immoral, vulgar, and encouraging pornography. There have been temporary blocks and warnings issued by countries including Indonesia,[211] Bangladesh,[212] India,[213] and Pakistan[214][215] over the content concerns. In 2018, Douyin was reprimanded by Chinese media watchdogs for showing "unacceptable" content.[216]
- On 27 July 2020, Egypt sentenced five women to two years in prison over TikTok videos. One of the women had encouraged other women to try and earn money on the platform, another woman was sent to prison for dancing. The court also imposed a fine of 300,000 Egyptian pounds (UK£14,600) on each defendant.[217]
- With reports that Palestinians resorted to TikTok for promoting their cause after platforms like Facebook and Twitter blocked their content,[218] Israeli analyst Yoni Ben-Menachem told Arab News in 2022 that the Chinese app was a "tool of dangerous influence" inciting violence through videos glorifying attacks against Israelis.[219][220] The Palestinian militant group Lion's Den gained much of their popularity through TikTok, according to Ynet.[221] In February 2023, Otzma Yehudit politician Almog Cohen advocated blocking TikTok for all of East Jerusalem.[222]
- Concerns have been voiced regarding content relating to, and the promotion and spreading of hate speech and far-right extremism, such as anti-semitism, racism, and xenophobia. Some videos were shown to expressly promote Holocaust denial and told viewers to take up arms and fight in the name of white supremacy and the swastika.[223] As TikTok has gained popularity among young children,[224] and the popularity of extremist and hateful content is growing, calls for tighter restrictions on their flexible boundaries have been made. TikTok has since released tougher parental controls to filter out inappropriate content and to ensure they can provide sufficient protection and security.[225]
- A viral TikTok trend known as "devious licks" involves students vandalizing or stealing school property and posting videos of the action on the platform. The trend has led to increasing school vandalism and subsequent measures taken by some schools to prevent damage. Some students have been arrested for participating in the trend.[226][227] TikTok has taken measures to remove and prevent access to content displaying the trend.[228]
- The Wall Street Journal has reported that doctors experienced a surge in reported cases of tics, tied to an increasing number of TikTok videos from content creators with Tourette syndrome. Doctors suggested that the cause may be a social one as users who consumed content showcasing various tics would sometimes develop tics of their own.[229]
- In March 2022, the Washington Post reported that Facebook owner Meta Platforms had paid Targeted Victory—a consulting firm backed by supporters of the U.S. Republican Party—to coordinate lobbying and media campaigns against TikTok to portray it as "a danger to American children and society", primarily to stoke anti-Chinese xenophobia and counter criticism of Facebook's own services. This included op-eds and letters to the editor in regional publications, the amplification of "dubious local news stories citing TikTok as the origin of dangerous teen trends" (such as the aforementioned "devious licks", and an alleged "Slap a Teacher" challenge), including those whose initial development actually began on Facebook, and the similar promotion of "proactive coverage" of Facebook corporate initiatives.[230]
- In Malaysia, TikTok is used by some users to engage in hate speech against race and religion especially mentioning the 13 May incident after the 2022 election. TikTok responded by taking down videos with content that violated their community guidelines.[231]
- Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita filed lawsuits against TikTok, alleging that the platform exposed inappropriate content to minors. The complaint also alleges that TikTok "intentionally falsely reports the frequency of sexual content, nudity, and mature/suggestive themes" on their platform which made the app's "12-plus" age ratings on the Apple and Google app stores deceptive.[232][233]
- TikTok raised the minimum age for livestreaming from 16 to 18 after a BBC News investigation found hundreds of accounts going live from Syrian refugee camps, with children begging for donations through digital gifts, which led to TikTok taking a 70% cut of the donations.[234]
- In March 2023, The Jewish Chronicle reported that TikTok was hosting videos promoting the neo-Nazi propaganda film Europa: The Last Battle, despite having being alerted to the issue four months prior.[235]
- In January 2020, left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America said that TikTok hosted misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic despite a recent policy against misinformation.[236] In April 2020, the government of India asked TikTok to remove users posting misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[237] There were also multiple conspiracy theories that the government is involved with the spread of the pandemic.[238] As a response to this, TikTok launched a feature to report content for misinformation.[239] It reported that in the second half of 2020, over 340,000 videos in the U.S. about election misinformation and 50,000 videos of COVID-19 misinformation were removed.[240]
- To combat misinformation in the 2022 midterm election in the US, TikTok announced a midterms Elections Center available in-app to users in 40 different languages. TikTok partnered with the National Association of Secretaries of State to give accurate local information to users.[241]
- In September 2022, NewsGuard Technologies reported that among the TikTok searches it had conducted and analyzed from the U.S., 19.4% surfaced misinformation such as questionable or harmful content about COVID-19 vaccines, homemade remedies, the 2020 US elections, the war in Ukraine, the Robb Elementary School shooting, and abortion. NewsGuard suggested that in contrast, results from Google were of higher quality.[242] Mashable's own test from Australia found innocuous results after searching for "getting my COVID vaccine" but suggestions such as "climate change is a myth" after typing in "climate change".[240]
- TikTok's censorship policy has been criticized as non-transparent.[243] Criticism of leaders such as Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Mahatma Gandhi[244] and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan[245] has been suppressed by the platform, as well as information relating to the Xinjiang internment camps and the Uyghur genocide.[246][247] Internal documents have revealed that moderators suppress posts created by users deemed "too ugly, poor, or disabled" for the platform, and censor political speech on livestreams.[248][249][250] TikTok moderators have also blocked content that could be perceived as positive towards LGBT people in addition to a set of country-specific censorship rules such as banning mentions of 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in China and Kurdish nationalism in Turkey.[245][251]
- In 2022, in response to criticism, the platform launched a "transparency center" – a virtual hub where researchers can access the platform's moderation tools and content guidelines, including a secret list of keywords used for filtering content.[252]
- TikTok is the 10th most popular app in Russia.[253] After a new set of Russian fake news laws was installed in March 2022, the company announced a series of restrictions on Russian and non-Russian posts and livestreams.[254][255] Tracking Exposed, a user data rights group, learned of what was likely a technical glitch that became exploited by pro-Russia posters. It stated that although this and other loopholes were patched by TikTok before the end of March, the initial failure to correctly implement the restrictions, in addition to the effects from Kremlin's "fake news" laws, contributed to the formation of a "splinternet ... dominated by pro-war content" in Russia.[256][253] TikTok said that it had removed 204 accounts for swaying public opinion about the war while obscuring their origins and that its fact checkers had removed 41,191 videos for violating its misinformation policies.[257][258]
- In October 2019, TikTok removed about two dozen accounts that were responsible for posting ISIL propaganda and execution videos on the app.[259][260]
- Privacy concerns have also been brought up regarding the app.[261][262] In its privacy policy, TikTok lists that it collects usage information, IP addresses, a user's mobile carrier, unique device identifiers, keystroke patterns, and location data, among other data.[263][264] Web developers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk said that allowing videos and other content to be shared by the app's users through HTTP puts the users' data privacy at risk.[265]
- Since the early 2020s, American conservatives have accused the website of spying on its users in cooperation with the Chinese government. These accusations and conspiracy theories were created in part by Republican consulting firms such as Targeted Victory as well as Facebook parent Meta.[266]
- In January 2020, Check Point Research discovered a security flaw in TikTok which could have allowed hackers access to user accounts using SMS.[267] In February, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman criticised the app, calling it "spyware", and stating "I look at that app as so fundamentally parasitic, that it's always listening, the fingerprinting technology they use is truly terrifying, and I could not bring myself to install an app like that on my phone."[268][269] Responding to Huffman's comments, TikTok stated, "These are baseless accusations made without a shred of evidence."[263] Wells Fargo banned the app from its devices due to privacy and security concerns.[270]
In May 2020, the Dutch Data Protection Authority announced an investigation into TikTok in relation to privacy protections for children.[271][272] In June 2020, the European Data Protection Board announced that it would assemble a task force to examine TikTok's user privacy and security practices.[273]
- In August 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok tracked Android user data, including MAC addresses and IMEIs, with a tactic in violation of Google's policies.[274][275] The report sparked calls in the U.S. Senate for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to launch an investigation.[276]
- In June 2021, TikTok updated its privacy policy to include collection of biometric data, including "faceprints and voiceprints".[277] Some experts reacted by calling the terms of collection and data use "vague" and "highly problematic".[278] The same month, CNBC reported that former employees had stated that "the boundaries between TikTok and ByteDance were so blurry as to be almost non-existent" and that "ByteDance employees are able to access U.S. user data" on TikTok.[279]
- In October 2021, following the Facebook Files and controversies about social media ethics, a bipartisan group of lawmakers also pressed TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat on questions of data privacy and moderation for age-appropriate content. The New York Times reported, "Lawmakers also hammered [head of U.S. policy at TikTok] Mr. Beckerman about whether TikTok's Chinese ownership could expose consumer data to Beijing," stating that "Critics have long argued that the company would be obligated to turn Americans' data over to the Chinese government if asked."[280] TikTok told U.S. lawmakers it does not give information to China's government. TikTok's representative stated that TikTok's data is stored in the U.S. with backups in Singapore. According to the company's representative, TikTok had "no affiliation" with the subsidiary Beijing ByteDance Technology, in which the Chinese government has a minority stake and board seat.[281]
- In June 2022, BuzzFeed News reported that leaked audio recordings of internal TikTok meetings revealed that certain China-based employees of the company maintain full access to overseas data.[282][283]
- In August 2022, software engineer and security researcher Felix Krause found that TikTok's in-app browser contained keylogger functionality.[284]
- In September 2022, during testimony to the Senate Homeland Security Committee, TikTok's COO stated that the company could not commit to stopping data transfers from US users to China. The COO reacted to concerns of the company's handling of user data by stating that TikTok does not operate in China, though the company does have an office there.[285]
- Additionally, in November 2022, TikTok's head of privacy for Europe, Elaine Fox, confirmed that some of its workers, including the workers in China, have access to the user info of accounts from the UK and European Union. According to Fox, this "privacy policy" was "based on a demonstrated need to do their job."[286]
- In March 2023, a former employee of the company held multiple meetings with US senators, stating that the company's proposed Project Texas data protections would not prevent Chinese employees of TikTok from "spying" on US users' data. The ex-employee also stated that a complete "re-engineering" of the app would be required to achieve privacy from China.[287]
- According to a 2023 investigation by the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), TikTok was accessible to children younger than 13 years old. This is despite TikTok's stipulation in their Terms of Service that users be 13 or older to create accounts. As a result, 1.4 million UK children under 13 years old managed to access the site in 2020. Moreover, as per ICO investigation, TikTok utilized these children's data without getting consent from their parents. Information Commissioner John Edwards believes that this information could have been used to profile these minors and present them with offensive or inappropriate stuff. In an interview with BBC, Edwards added that TikTok has not made any efforts to collect permission from parents. Because of this breach of children's privacy, this video-sharing platform now faces a penalty of £12.7m. TikTok has 28 days for representation and appeals for a penalty reduction. The regulator's final decision will be issued at most 16 weeks from the date of the issuance of the proposed fine.[288]
- In May 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that former employees complained about TikTok tracking users who had viewed LGBT-related content, leading to fears of collected data potentially usable for blackmail.[289]
- On 27 February 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fined ByteDance U.S.$5.7 million for collecting information from minors under the age of 13 in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.[290] ByteDance responded by adding a kids-only mode to TikTok which blocks the upload of videos, the building of user profiles, direct messaging, and commenting on others' videos, while still allowing the viewing and recording of content.[291] In May 2020, an advocacy group filed a complaint with the FTC saying that TikTok had violated the terms of the February 2019 consent decree, which sparked subsequent Congressional calls for a renewed FTC investigation.[292][293][294][295] In July 2020, it was reported that the FTC and the United States Department of Justice had initiated investigations.[296]
- In February 2019, the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner's Office launched an investigation of TikTok following the fine ByteDance received from the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Speaking to a parliamentary committee, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said that the investigation focuses on the issues of private data collection, the kind of videos collected and shared by children online, as well as the platform's open messaging system which allows any adult to message any child. She noted that the company was potentially violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which requires the company to provide different services and different protections for children.[297]
- On 22 January 2021, the Italian Data Protection Authority ordered the blocking of the use of the data of users whose age has not been established on the social network.[298][299] The order was issued after the death of a 10-year-old Sicilian girl, which occurred after the execution of a challenge shared by users of the platform that involved attempting to choke the user with a belt around the neck. The block is set to remain in place until 15 February, when it will be re-evaluated.[300][needs update]
- In September 2021, the Ireland Data Protection Commissioner opened investigations into TikTok concerning the protection of minors' data and transfers of personal data to China.[301][302]
- In February 2022, the incumbent Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton, initiated an investigation into TikTok for alleged violations of children's privacy and facilitation of human trafficking.[303][304] Paxton claimed that the Texas Department of Public Safety gathered several pieces of content showing the attempted recruitment of teenagers to smuggle people or goods across the Mexico–United States border. He claimed the evidence may prove the company's involvement in "human smuggling, sex trafficking and drug trafficking." The company claimed that no illegal activity of any kind is supported on the platform.[305]
- In December 2022, TikTok confirmed that journalists' data was accessed by employees of its parent company. It previously denied using location information to track U.S. users.[306]
- TikTok parent company ByteDance fired four employees who improperly accessed the personal data of two journalists on the platform, a TikTok spokesman ByteDance confirmed to CNN. As ByteDance employees investigated potential employee leaks to the media, they accessed the TikTok user data of two journalists, according to the company. Personal data obtained from journalists' accounts included IP addresses, which can be used to track location.[307] This was apparently done in order to reveal the journalists' sources.[308]
- The incident is reportedly being investigated by the FBI as of March 2023.[309]
- In February 2023, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, along with its counterparts in Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, launched an investigation into TikTok's data collection practices.[310]
- As with other platforms,[311] journalists in several countries have raised privacy concerns about the app because it is popular with children and has the potential to be used by sexual predators.[311][312][313][314]
- Several users have reported endemic cyberbullying on TikTok,[315][316] including racism[317] and ableism.[318][319][320] In December 2019, following a report by German digital rights group Netzpolitik.org, TikTok admitted that it had suppressed videos by disabled users as well as LGBTQ+ users in a purported effort to limit cyberbullying.[321][248] TikTok's moderators were also told to suppress users with "abnormal body shape", "ugly facial looks", "too many wrinkles", or in "slums, rural fields" and "dilapidated housing" to prevent bullying.[322]
- In 2021, the platform revealed that it will be introducing a feature that will prevent teenagers from receiving notifications past their bedtime. The company will no longer send push notifications after 9 PM to users aged between 13 and 15. For 16 to 17 year olds, notifications will not be sent after 10 PM.[323]
- In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that "Mental-health professionals around the country are growing increasingly concerned about the effects on teen girls of posting sexualized TikTok videos."[324] In March 2022, a coalition of U.S. state attorneys general launched an investigation into TikTok's effect on children's mental health.[325]
- In November 2022, Australia's medical regulatory agency, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) reported that there was a global shortage of the diabetes medication Ozempic. Ozempic is a brand of semaglutide used by patients with Type-2 diabetes to regulate blood glucose, with weight loss as side effect. According to the TGA, the rise in demand was caused by an increase in off-label prescription of the drug for weight loss purposes. Off-label prescription is the prescription of a drug for purposes other than what it was approved for.[326] In December 2022, after the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) listed Ozempic as being in shortage in the United States as well, it was reported that huge increase in demand for off-label prescriptions of the medicine was caused by a weight loss trend on TikTok, where videos about the drug had exceeded 360 million views.[327][328][329] Wegovy, a drug with a higher dosage of semaglutide that has been specifically approved for use in treating obesity, also became popular on the platform after Elon Musk credited it for helping him lose weight.[330][331]
- Several former employees of the company have claimed of poor workplace conditions, including the start of the workweek on Sunday to cooperate with Chinese timezones and excessive workload. Employees claimed they averaged 85 hours of meetings per week and would frequently stay up all night in order to complete tasks. Some employees claimed the workplace's schedule operated similarly to the 996 schedule. The company has a stated policy of working from 10 AM to 7 PM five days per week (63 hours per week), but employees noted that it was encouraged for employees to work after hours. One female worker complained that the company did not allow her adequate time to change her feminine hygiene product because of back-to-back meetings. Another employee noted that working at the company caused her to seek marriage therapy and lose an unhealthy amount of weight.[332] In response to the allegations, the company noted that they were committed to allowing employees "support and flexibility".[333][334]
- China censors and regulates the contents that Douyin shows, including to minors in the country. There are also different time restrictions in place according to the user's age. Screen time limits on TikTok are largely voluntary.[335][336]
- In January 2023, Forbes reported that employees use a manual "heating" tool in order to distribute certain videos widely, without disclosing this to users. Based on conversations with unnamed employees and former employees, the magazine said ByteDance did this to inflate the apparent value of the platform for influencers while negotiating deals, and that it has also been abused by some employees to promoted their own accounts or those of their spouses.[308] A documented called the MINT Heating Playbook reportedly says heated videos account for 1-2% of views. The company apparently built the tool in order to diversify the content on the platform compared to what the automatic algorithm was recommending, to keep users more interested.[308]
- TikTok has been criticized for its privacy practices[261] and censoring of content made by LGBTQ+ users as well as content that criticized the Chinese government.[245][246]
- Tencent's WeChat platform has been accused of blocking Douyin's videos.[337][338] In April 2018, Douyin sued Tencent and accused it of spreading false and damaging information on its WeChat platform, demanding CN¥1 million in compensation and an apology. In June 2018, Tencent filed a lawsuit against Toutiao and Douyin in a Beijing court, alleging they had repeatedly defamed Tencent with negative news and damaged its reputation, seeking a nominal sum of CN¥1 in compensation and a public apology.[339] In response, Toutiao filed a complaint the following day against Tencent for allegedly unfair competition and asking for CN¥90 million in economic losses.[340]
- In November 2019, a class action lawsuit was filed in California that alleged that TikTok transferred personally identifiable information of U.S. persons to servers located in China owned by Tencent and Alibaba.[341][342][343] The lawsuit also accused ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, of taking user content without their permission. The plaintiff of the lawsuit, college student Misty Hong, downloaded the app but said she never created an account. She realized a few months later that TikTok has created an account for her using her information (such as biometrics) and made a summary of her information. The lawsuit also alleged that information was sent to Chinese tech giant Baidu.[344] In July 2020, twenty lawsuits against TikTok were merged into a single class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.[345] In February 2021, TikTok agreed to pay $92 million to settle the class action lawsuit.[346]
- In May 2021, Canadian voice actor Bev Standing filed a lawsuit against TikTok over the use of her voice in the text-to-speech feature without her permission. The lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York. TikTok declined to comment. Standing believes that TikTok used recordings she made for the Chinese government-run Institute of Acoustics.[347] The voice used in the feature was subsequently changed.[348]
- In June 2021, the Netherlands-based Market Information Research Foundation (SOMI) filed a €1.4 billion lawsuit on behalf of Dutch parents against TikTok, alleging that the app gathers data on children without adequate permission.[349]
- Multiple lawsuits have been filed against TikTok, accusing the platform of hosting content that led to the death of at least seven children.[350] The lawsuits claim that children died after attempting the "Blackout challenge", a TikTok trend that involves strangling or asphyxiating someone or themselves until they black out (passing out). TikTok stated that search queries for the challenge do not show any results, linking instead to protective resources, while the parents of two of the deceased argued that the content showed up on their children's TikTok feeds, without them searching for it.[351]

URL: https://qz.com/1900530/tiktok-shadow-bans-lgbt-hashtags-in-russian-and-arabic/
- Update: This story has been amended to include comment from TikTok.
- Try searching for hashtags related to LGBT issues in countries like Russia, Bosnia, and Jordan on TikTok and you might find no results, even if you were able to see it on a friend’s post.
- That’s because the app is now shadow banning such hashtags, including the word “gay” in languages including Russian (гей), Arabic (الجنس_مثلي), and Bosnian (gej), according to findings in a new report released by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a think tank. Hashtags like “#transgender” in Arabic (#جنسي المتحول) and #I am a gay/lesbian” in Russian (#ягей/#ялесбиянка) are also suppressed. Shadow banning refers to a way of censorship whereby social media companies reduce the visibility of particular content or even stop content from being seen by other users without the uploader being aware of the ban, as opposed to a blanket ban.
- While social media platforms around the world are coming under growing criticism for their content moderation policies, TikTok arguably attracts greater scrutiny because of its relationship to Chinese owner ByteDance. The app was found last year to have censored videos such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests. The Guardian also reported last year that TikTok had outright banned content seen as pro-LGBT in countries such as Turkey, according to leaked local moderation guidelines.
- The US government has demanded TikTok find an American buyer or face a ban in the country by early November, due to national security concerns. Companies including Microsoft, which has teamed up with Walmart, as well as Oracle are reportedly interested in TikTok. The sale, however, has been complicated by Beijing’s recent move to restrict the export of certain technologies including “data-based personalized information recommendation services”—the kind of algorithm core to TikTok’s global success.
- “The meteoric growth of TikTok has now put the [Chinese Communist Party] in a position from which it can shape the information environment on a largely non-Chinese-speaking platform,” wrote ASPI in the report. The think tank argues that TikTok is the first globally popular social media network that takes a “heavy-handed approach” to content moderation, and as such governments should hold Chinese tech services to the same data privacy and protection standards as they do for other international social media networks. The report also names WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging app in China, as another major tool used by the Chinese government to influence the information environment of the Chinese diaspora and even foreign users of the app. WeChat also faces a US ban that could come into effect as soon as Sept. 15.
- According to ASPI, other major hashtags that are shadow banned by the app include “#acab,” an acronym for “all cops are bastards,” “#Putin is a thief” in Russian, “#Jokowi,” a nickname for Indonesian president Joko Widodo, and “#why do we need a king” in Thai, amid a wave of protests in Thailand that are openly defying the monarchy.
- ASPI also found that TikTok categorizes most of the shadow-banned LGBT hashtags in the same way that it does terrorist groups such as ISIS, swear words, and illicit substances such as cocaine. Some of these hashtags were also categorized by the app as non-existent despite the terms having been tagged in videos on the app.
- In a statement, ASPI said that, “We believe that accountability and transparency are essential to facilitating trust with our community. As part of this, we’ve committed to making our moderation policies, algorithm, and data security practices available to experts, which no other company in our space has been willing to do.” It also reiterated that it has never shared information with the Chinese government and would not do so if asked. In its response to ASPI, TikTok explained that some of the restrictions on hashtags were due to their associations with pornographic searches. It added that the company “strongly supports our LGBTQ creators around the world.”

- TikTok (Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty)
- TikTok has admitted to restricting LGBT-related hashtags in several languages and regions after being exposed by an Australian think tank.
- The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) found that TikTok was censoring the hashtags “gay,” “lesbian,” and “transgender” in Russian, Estonian, Bosnian, and Arabic, the terms “I am a gay/lesbian” in Russian, and “transgender” and “transitioning” in Arabic. This affected global users no matter where in the world they live.
- The social media platform quietly restricted the content under a “shadow ban”, a stealth form of censorship in which a user may not be aware that they are being censored.
- “TikTok users posting videos with these hashtags are given the impression their posts are just as searchable as posts by other users, but in fact they aren’t,” the report explained.
- “In practice, most of these hashtags are categorised in TikTok’s code in the same way that terrorist groups, illicit substances and swear words are treated on the platform. On some occasions, hashtags are categorised as non-existent, when in fact they’re tagged on videos across the platform.”
- The shadow ban even restricted an English phrase, “acab,” short for “all cops are b****rds,” a hashtag that trended during the Black Lives Matter uprising following the police killing of George Floyd.
- In response to the report, a TikTok spokesperson claimed the social media platform is “deeply committed to inclusivity” and denied it was practicing censorship. They said the shadow ban was a “localised” approach to moderation.
- Other LGBTQ+ related hashtags are completely blocked.

- We posted a video to #GayArab but when we clicked on the hashtag, it redirected to a “#null” page. pic.twitter.com/3MjILPRKWE
- — ?Fergus Ryan (@fryan) September 8, 2020
- 
- Some terms “were partially restricted due to relevant local laws,” while “other terms were restricted because they were primarily used when looking for pornographic content,” the spokesperson claimed. Other terms in English and Arabic were “incorrectly moderated,” they added.
- “We are currently conducting a review of those terms that were moderated in error and will look for ways to improve our processes to avoid similar issues in the future,” they continued.
- “In addition, we want to be crystal clear that TikTok strongly supports our LGBTQ creators around the world and is proud that LGBTQ content is among the most popular category on the platform with billions of views.”
- It’s not the first time TikTok has admitted to censoring LGBT+ people: just last year the platform was revealed to be blocking pro-LGBT+ content in some conservative countries, even if homosexuality has never been illegal there.
- In attempt to provide “locally sensitive” moderation the app went substantially further than it was required to by law, banning any content that could be seen as positive to LGBT+ people – even same-sex couples holding hands.
- At the time TikTok recognised “the need to do more” and claimed it was actively working with local third parties to ensure its processes are more appropriate – but it appears it still has a long way to go.

- TikTok has acknowledged that it restricts LGBT-related hashtags in some countries as part of its "localised" approach to moderation.
- A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) think-tank said many LGBT hashtags were "shadow-banned" in Bosnia, Jordan and Russia.
- A shadow ban limits the discovery of content without indicating that a particular hashtag is on a ban list.
- TikTok said that some hashtags were restricted to comply with local laws.
- According to the ASPI, terms that were not linking to content included:
- TikTok said that while some terms were restricted to comply with local laws, others were limited because they were primarily used to discover pornographic content.
- It added that some English phrases and some compound phrases in Arabic had been moderated by mistake, and that it had fixed the issue.
- And it said some of the hashtags reported by the ASPI did not reveal any content because they had never been used by a video-maker on TikTok.
- It said it was "deeply committed to inclusivity".
- By Ben Hunte, LGBT correspondent
- Many LGBT social media users will be unsurprised by these findings - especially those who live in one of the "shadow-banned" nations, where the struggle to be themselves extends far beyond hashtags on the internet.
- In June 2020, TikTok branded itself as supportive of LGBT Pride, and the company made donations to organisations supporting LGBT people.
- While TikTok may believe in "accountability and transparency", its algorithm keeps getting caught out for discrimination.
- One TikTok user living in South East Asia told me, while they were disappointed that their gender identity was being categorised as inappropriate in their native language, they knew the ways around the bans and frequently used them.
- They added: "That's just part of what being LGBT in 2020 is."
- LGBT rights group Stonewall said social media platforms such as TikTok provided a "vital community hub" for LGBT people, "particularly for those living in countries where they can face persecution for being themselves".
- "While we understand why local laws my affect some restrictions, it's crucial TikTok follows up its statement of support for LGBT creators with action to tackle shadow banning of LGBT hashtags," said Stonewall's head of communications, Robbie de Santos.
- In a statement, TikTok said: "We believe that accountability and transparency are essential to facilitating trust with our community. As part of this, we've committed to making our moderation policies, algorithm, and data security practices available to experts, which no other company in our space has been willing to do."
- In February, transgender users complained of censorship on TikTok after many had posts removed from the video-sharing platform.
- And in December 2019, it was revealed that videos by disabled users were deliberately prevented from going viral by the app's moderators.

- Popular social media platform TikTok has been accused of censoring political and social topics including LGBTQ+ issues, the crackdown on Uighurs in China and protests in the United States.
- A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute found the video platform was a "powerful political actor with global reach" that censored topics and actively demoted and suppressed content to make it harder to find.

- The findings will place further pressure on the company within Australia as its Chinese owner, ByteDance, continues negotiations to sell the platform to a US company and avoid a ban by the Trump administration.
- Some Australian Liberal MPs privately want a ban on TikTok but Prime Minister Scott Morrison has decided the social media platform does not present any major national security concerns after receiving advice from security agencies.
- TikTok, which features 15-second videos of users lip-syncing and dancing, has come under criticism for a lack of transparency over the algorithms it uses to decide which videos are given precedence.
- The ASPI report found hashtags on TikTok related to LGBTQ+ issues were suppressed on theplatform in at least eight languages.
- "This blunt approach to censorship affects not only citizens of a particular country, but all users speaking those languages, no matter where in the world they live," the report said. "TikTok users posting videos with these hashtags are given the impression their posts are just as searchable as posts by other users, but in fact they aren't."
- It raised concerns about posts featuring "Xinjiang" disappearing from the platform's hashtag search results. The Chinese government is facing international condemnation for its treatment of Uighur Muslims in the far-western Xinjiang region.
- According to TikTok, some terms are restricted due to local laws and it has identified and fixed an issue where some phrases in Arabic were being incorrectly moderated.
- A spokeswoman for TikTok said the company "believes accountability and transparency are essential to facilitating trust with our community".
- "As part of this, we've committed to making our moderation policies, algorithm and data security practices available to experts, which no other company in our space has been willing to do," the company spokeswoman said.
- "As we've said before, TikTok user data is stored in the US and Singapore, with strict controls on employee access. We have never shared user information with the Chinese government and wouldn't do so if asked."
- The report also found Chinese social media platform WeChat was censoring content and being used by the Chinese Communist Party to harass and threaten the families of overseas Chinese activists, particularly Uighurs.
- The owners of WeChat and TikTok are both subject to China's security and cyber-security laws, which force them to co-operate with requests for information from Chinese authorities.
- The ASPI report called on governments to put in place a set of "transparency" rules for all social media companies. This would include making platforms disclose the guidelines used by their human moderators and the impact their decisions had on their algorithms.
- It also recommended all social media companies be required to investigate and disclose information operations being conducted on their platforms by state and non-state actors.
- WeChat has about 1.2 billion monthly users worldwide, including 100 million installations outside China, while TikTok has a global audience of nearly 700 million including an estimated 1.6 million users in Australia.
- While Chinese social media platforms such as WeChat have been building their reach among the Chinese diaspora for years, TikTok is the first Chinese tech giant to have a truly international user base.
- Microsoft is in discussions to buy TikTok in the US – and possibly its operations in Australia, Canada and New Zealand – after US President Donald Trump gave ByteDance 45 days to sell TikTok or face being banned in America.

- Sept 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - TikTok has apologised for suppressing LGBT+ content in the past, with a director telling British lawmakers on Tuesday that the company now removed LGBT+ images only when required to do so by law enforcement agencies.
- The video streaming app came under fire last year over reports it censored depictions of homosexuality, such as two men kissing or holding hands, and artificially prevented posts from LGBT+ users from going viral in some countries.
- “I’m really sorry, we really got that wrong,” TikTok’s director of public policy in Europe the Middle East and Africa, Theo Bertram, told a British parliamentary committee referring to the practice of curtailing the reach of some posts.
- Bertram said viewership of some LGBT+ videos, as well as posts from disabled or plus size users, was deliberately limited in a bid to reduce bullying on the platform.
- “That was a terrible idea,” he told the sub-committee on online harms and disinformation, adding the policy had since been changed.
- TikTok, which boasts hundreds of millions of users worldwide, is widely used by young LGBT+ people to share niche jokes, find a date, and swap advice and stories about traumatic experiences such as being forced into conversion therapy.
- Speaking about the removal of LGBT+ content, Bertram said the company would do so only upon receiving a specific request from law enforcement agencies in countries, like Russia, where there were laws banning the dissemination of LGBT+ materials.
- “I think the Russian law is terrible and our community does too ... But unfortunately we have to comply with legal requests in the countries that we operate,” he said.
- Russia adopted a so-called “gay propaganda” law in 2013, which makes illegal any event or act regarded by the authorities as an attempt to promote homosexuality to minors.
- Separately on Tuesday, TikTok said it had removed over 104 million videos from its platform globally in the first half of the year for violating its terms of service.
- The company owned by China’s ByteDance and at the centre of a political battle between Washington and Beijing, was also criticised earlier this month for suppressing LGBT+ related hashtags in some countries.
- A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) think-tank found the Russian, Estonian, Bosnian, and Arabic version of some terms like “gay” and “I am a lesbian” were “shadowbanned” - meaning searches would yield no results.
- Responding to the report, TikTok said some hashtags had been restricted to comply with local laws, while others because they were primarily used for searching pornographic content.
- Some compound phrases in English and Arabic had been moderated by mistake, but the issue had been solved, it added.
- Asked if the company was still restricting the prevalence of LGBT+ hashtags in some countries, and particularly in Russia, Bertram said he did not think that was the case.
- “Not as far as I’m aware, you can create any content on our platform, there is no restrictions,” he said, adding he was unsure as to what the company would do if requested to take down an hashtag by law enforcement agency.
- “I don’t know the answer to that,” he said.
- TikTok owner, ByteDance has been racing to avoid a crackdown on TikTok after being at loggerheads with the U.S. government.
- U.S. officials have expressed concerns that personal data of as many as 100 million Americans that use the app is being passed on to China's Communist Party government.

- TikTok bezeichnet sich selbst als LGBT-freundlich
- Australische Experten gehen hart ins Gericht mit der chinesischen App TikTok. Laut einem Bericht des Australian Strategic Policy Institute 


 (ASPI), der in dieser Woche veröffentlicht worden ist, sollen die Betreiber bewusst soziale und politische Themen unterdrücken.
- In dem 72-seitigen Bericht werfen die Autorinnen und Autoren des ASPI der populären Videoplattform mit ihren 700 Millionen Nutzern unter anderem vor, sich aktiv an der Zensur zahlreicher Themen zu beteiligen, "indem Inhalte herabgestuft oder unterdrückt werden". Das "kometenhafte Wachstum von TikTok hat die Kommunistische Partei Chinas in eine Position gebracht, von der aus sie das Informationsfeld auf einer riesigen nicht chinesischen Plattform gestalten können", schreiben die Autoren der Denkfabrik, die unter anderem vom australischen Verteidigungsministerium finanziert wird.
- Demnach werden etwa Hashtags zu Homosexualität auf die gleiche Weise ausgeblendet wie Schimpfwörter und Terrorgruppen, heißt es in dem Bericht. Auch in der vergangenen Woche seien noch Beiträge heimlich verborgen worden, etwa Videos, die in Sprachen wie Russisch, Arabisch und Bosnisch mit dem Hashtag "schwul" gekennzeichnet waren. Auch "lesbisch", "transgender" und andere LGBTQ-verwandte Begriffe gehörten demnach zu den mancherorts unterdrückten Hashtags. LGBTQ steht für Lesben, Schwule, Bisexuelle, Transsexuelle und queere Menschen.
- Auf eine Anfrage des SPIEGEL teilte eine TikTok-Sprecherin am Freitag mit, es gebe nationale Unterschiede, wenn es um die Handhabung von Hashtags geht. "Als Teil unseres lokalisierten Moderationsansatzes waren einige Begriffe, die das ASPI zur Verfügung stellte, teilweise aufgrund einschlägiger örtlicher Gesetze eingeschränkt", sagte die Sprecherin.
- Andere Begriffe seien eingeschränkt worden, "weil sie in erster Linie bei der Suche nach pornografischen Inhalten verwendet wurden" oder weil es einen Fehler bei der Übersetzung aus dem Arabischen gegeben habe. Die Begriffe würden derzeit überprüft, ähnliche Probleme sollen künftig vermieden werden.
- Den Vorwurf, man leite Informationen an die chinesische Regierung weiter, dementierte TikTok. Man habe keine Daten von Nutzern an die chinesische Regierung weitergegeben und "würde dies auch auf Anfrage nicht tun".
- Dennoch empfehlen die ASPI-Autoren radikale Schritte. Sie schreiben: "Da die in diesem Bericht beschriebenen Zensurmethoden so große Ausmaße annehmen, dass sie geltendes Recht in liberalen Demokratien weltweit brechen, sollten Regierungen juristische Untersuchungen einleiten".
- TikTok war in den vergangenen Monaten mehrfach Zensur- und Spionagevorwürfen ausgesetzt und wehrte sich stets dagegen. Dem Erfolg haben sie ohnehin nicht geschadet: Nach wie vor sind US-Unternehmen an einer Übernahme des US-Geschäfts vom chinesischen Mutterkonzern ByteDance interessiert, darunter Microsoft und Oracle. US-Donald Trump hatte gedroht, die App in den USA andernfalls zu verbieten.

- 
- TikTok zensiert weltweit Hashtags zu LGBTQ-Themen auf Russisch und Arabisch. Das entdeckte das Australian Strategic Policy Institute nach monatelangen Recherchen rund um die App. Die Zensur betrifft nicht nur Videos in Russland oder arabischsprachigen Länder, sondern weltweit alle Nutzer:innen der App.
- TikTok zensiert und versteckt Hashtags zu LGBTQ-Themen in mindestens acht Sprachen. Das entdeckte ein Forscherteam des Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) bei Recherchen rund um die App.
- Nach außen hin gibt sich TikTok als Plattform, auf der alle gleichermaßen willkommen sind. Zur globalen Pride Month im Juni feierte TikTok lautstark seine LGBTQ-Community, rief zu Spenden auf, legte Regenbogenflaggen und Effekte über die Videos. Doch im Maschinenraum der App sieht es anders aus.
- Betroffen sind etwa der arabische Hashtags مثلي_الجنس# („schwul“) und المتحول جنسي# („transgender“) und die russischen Hashtags #гей („schwul“) und #ялесбиянка („Ich bin lesbisch“). Auch #gei auf Estnisch und #gej auf Bosnisch werden zensiert. TikTok-Nutzer:innen, die Videos mit diesen Tags posten, merken nicht, dass ihre Inhalte in der Suche unterdrückt werden. Ihre Videos werden nicht gelöscht – die Methode wird deshalb auch als Shadowbanning bezeichnet. In der Praxis behandelt TikTok diese Hashtags aber ähnlich wie terroristische Organisationen, Drogen oder Kraftausdrücke: Wer danach sucht, bekommt eine Fehlermeldung. In einigen Fällen suggeriert TikTok in den Suchergebnissen, dass die Begriffe nicht verwendet würden – obwohl sie für zahlreiche Videos auf der Plattform im Einsatz sind.
- TikToks Manager:innen und der chinesische Mutterkonzern ByteDance werden nicht müde zu betonen, dass die App von „keiner fremden Regierung beeinflusst wird, auch nicht der chinesischen Regierung“. Auch sollen die Moderationsregeln der App keinen „politischen Befindlichkeiten“ folgen. Die jetzt von ASPI aufgedeckten Zensurpraktiken zeigen das Gegenteil: eine Plattform, die in ihrer Bereitschaft, alles zu zensieren, was gegen die homo- und transfeindlichen „Befindlichkeiten“ von Regierungen verstoßen könnte, alle anderen Mitstreiter:innen überbietet.
- TikTok verweist darauf, dass bestimmte Hashtags aufgrund von lokalen Gesetzen unterdrückt werden müssten. Doch die Plattform geht auf mehreren Ebenen weit über das hinaus, was Gesetze vorschreiben. Denn die Maßnahmen betreffen nicht nur Nutzer:innen in russisch- und arabischsprachigen Ländern, sondern gelten weltweit – auch für Nutzer:innen in Deutschland, den USA oder anderen Ländern. Dabei wäre TikTok durchaus in der Lage, die Zensur auf bestimmte Regionen zu begrenzen. In anderen Bereichen arbeitet die App stark mit Geolokalisierung.
- Im Fall von Russland geht die Zensur zudem weit über das hinaus, was andere Social-Media-Plattformen tun. Seit 2013 ist es dort verboten „Propaganda für nicht-traditionelle sexuelle Beziehungen“ zu verbreiten – ein Gesetz, das die Menschenrechte massiv einschränkt. Weder Instagram noch Twitter lassen sich davon beeindrucken, beide Plattformen zeigen auch in Russland weiterhin LGBTQ-Hashtags an. TikTok scheint dagegen überzuerfüllen, was sich die russische Regierung wünscht – auf Kosten der Nutzer:innen.
- Dass TikTok LGBTQ-Inhalte zensierte, war schon länger bekannt. Whistleblower aus dem Unternehmen hatten 2019 Moderationsrichtlinien an den Guardian geleakt, die zeigten, dass TikTok Inhalte auch in solchen Ländern zensiert, in denen Homosexualität niemals illegal war. In der Türkei sollten demnach Videos zensiert werden, auf denen Männer sich Küssen oder an den Händen halten, auch Pride-Demonstrationen oder andere Dinge, die „Homosexualität bewerben“ sollten versteckt werden. In unseren eigenen Recherchen haben wir aufgedeckt, dass TikTok die Reichweite von LGBTQ-Nutzer:innen über Monate gedrosselt hat – vorgeblich um sie vor Mobbing zu schützen.
- Die Maßnahmen betreffen nach Recherchen von ASPI auch politische Hashtags. So wurde der Hashtag #acab – ein Acronym für „all cops are bastards“ – in der Suche nicht angezeigt, als zur gleichen Zeit die Demonstrationen gegen den Mord am Schwarzen US-Amerikaner George Floyd ihren Höhepunkt erreichten und der Begriff zu einem Ausdruck der Proteste gegen Polizeigewalt wurde. Nach massiver öffentlicher Kritik war der Hashtag Ende Mai in der Suche plötzlich wieder da, TikTok verwies auf einen „technischen Fehler“. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt hatte der Hashtag  laut dem dem Digital Forensic Research Lab des Atlantic Council bereits 96,5 Millionen Ansichten.
- Drei Monate später war der Hashtag schon wieder aus der Suche getilgt worden, entdeckten die Forscher:innen. Zugleich demonstrierten Tausende in Kenosha gegen rassistische Polizeigewalt, nachdem ein Polizist den Schwarzen US-Amerikaner Jacob Blake in den Rücken geschossen hatte.
- Es sei sehr unwahrscheinlich, schreiben die ASPI-Forscher:innen in ihrem Bericht, dass der Hashtag ein weiteres Mal von einem technischen Fehler betroffen gewesen sei. Sie vermuten vielmehr, dass TikTok die schwindende öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit nutzte, um den Hashtag unauffällig ein weiteres Mal zu zensieren.

Die Begriffe würden derzeit überprüft, um „ähnliche Probleme in Zukunft zu vermeiden.“
- Gestern gab die EU-Kommission bekannt, dass TikTok einem freiwilligen Kodex zur Bekämpfung von Hassrede im Netz beigetreten ist. Damit folgt die chinesische Plattform anderen Tech-Unternehmen wie Facebook, Microsoft, YouTube oder Twitter, die bereits seit 2016 an dem Abkommen beteiligt sind. Die Unternehmen verpflichten sich darin unter anderem dazu, „klare und wirksame Verfahren für die Prüfung von Meldungen über illegale Hassreden in ihren Diensten einführen, um solche Inhalte zu entfernen oder den Zugang dazu zu sperren“. In dem Kodex bekennen sich die Firmen außerdem dazu, ihre Nutzer zu informieren und dafür zu sensibilisieren, „welche Art von Inhalten nach ihren Regeln und Community-Leitlinien nicht erlaubt sind“.
- TikTok tilgt bereits heute terroristische Propaganda, rassistische oder antisemitische Hetze und neuerdings auch Verschwörungstheorien wie QAnon von der Plattform. Das Unternehmen sucht per Algorithmus nach solchen Inhalten und versucht sie frühzeitig zu löschen. Hashtags wie #Nazi, #ISIS oder #KKK werden zudem in der Suche zensiert, seit Juli 2020 auch #QAnon.
- Doch während die Einschränkung der Meinungsfreiheit in diesen Fällen rechtlich gedeckt ist, zeigt die Zensur von Hashtags zu Polizeigewalt und LGBTQ-Themen, dass TikTok in seiner Content-Moderation nach wie vor einen grobmotorischen Ansatz fährt. Technisch gesehen behandelt die App diese Themen alle gleichermaßen als unerwünschte Inhalte und zensiert sie in der Suche – egal, ob es sich dabei um Terrorismus, Extremismus, Verschwörungstheorien oder Homosexualität handelt.

- Datenschützer:innen in drei Ländern prüfen mögliche Verstöße durch die chinesische App. Ein Umzug nach Irland könnte die Untersuchungen allerdings erschweren.
- Laut TikToks eigenen Regeln müssen Nutzer:innen mindestens 13 Jahren sein. Überprüft wird die Altersgrenze nicht. Mehr noch: Insider berichten, dass Moderator:innen in der Vergangenheit angewiesen wurden, selbst Kinder auf der Plattform nicht zu sperren. Auffällige Videos wurden stattdessen an ein Team in Peking geschickt.

An die Guten content creator kann ich nur appellieren ihre Inhalte wo anders Hochzustellen!
- Am Ende halten sie sich damit einfach unpolitisch.
Die meisten Dinge die sich auf LGBTI fixieren sind ja (logischerweise) politisch, denn das sind immernoch Kampfthemen. Sie werden wohl kaum einfach Bilder von glücklichen Homopärchen aussortieren, aber wenn das Bild gepostet wird um Politik zu machen (Pro Homoehe z.B.) dann ist es eben ein politischer Inhalt
- >Sie werden wohl kaum einfach Bilder von glücklichen Homopärchen aussortieren,

- Australische Forscher haben herausgefunden, dass Tiktok bestimmte Inhalte verschwinden lässt.
- © Quelle: -/XinHua/dpa
- Die chinesische Social-Media-App Tiktok steht erneut in der Kritik. Eine Gruppe australischer Forscher spricht vom sogenannten Shadowbanning. Dabei soll die Plattform gezielt bestimmte Inhalte zensieren und diese Nutzern im Feed vorenthalten.
- Forscher des Australian Strategic Policy Institutes (ASPI) werfen der App Tiktok die Zensur von politischen Themen sowie Beiträgen im Zusammenhang mit LGBTQ vor. Wie die Gruppe im Rahmen einer Analyse herausgefunden hat, versteckt die Plattform Hashtags aus entsprechenden Bereichen in mehreren Sprachen. Tiktok unterdrücke gezielt Inhalte und mache diese schwerer auffindbar, heißt es in dem Bericht. Die Indexierung bestimmter Hashtags, die nicht offiziell auf einer Bannliste auftauchen, wird auch als Shadowbanning bezeichnet.
- Von der Zensur betroffen sind unter anderem die arabischen Hashtags für die Wörter “schwul” und “transgender”, auch die russischen Begriffe #гей (“schwul”) und #ялесбиянка (“Ich bin lesbisch”) wurden von Tiktok verbannt. Die Videos werden zwar nicht gelöscht, erscheinen allerdings nicht in der Suchfunktion und auch im Feed werden Videos mit entsprechenden Schlagwörtern nicht angezeigt. “Diese Art der globalen Zensur ist nicht unpolitisch. Im Gegenteil: Sie macht die App zu einem politisch mächtigen Akteur”, schreiben die Forscher.
- “Diese unverblümte Herangehensweise an die Zensur betrifft nicht nur die Bürger eines bestimmten Landes, sondern alle Nutzer, die diese Sprachen sprechen, unabhängig davon, wo auf der Welt sie leben”, heißt es weiter. Währenddessen werde Tiktok-Benutzern, die Videos mit diesen Hashtags posten, der Eindruck vermittelt, dass ihre Beiträge genauso durchsuchbar sind wie die Beiträge anderer Benutzer. In Wirklichkeit seien sie dies jedoch nicht.
- Auch einige politische Begriffe stehen bei Tiktok offenbar auf einer Blacklist. So ist ein Hashtag in Bezug auf den indonesischen Präsidenten Joko Widodo oder der Ausruf “Why do we need a king?” auf Thailändisch von dem Shadowbanning betroffen. Ebenfalls sind unter dem Ausdruck “Putin ist ein Dieb” auf Russisch keine Beiträge zu finden, wie die Forscher herausgefunden haben. In ihrem Bericht haben die Forscher eine vollständige Liste der von der Moderation zensierten Hashtags veröffentlicht.

- Gegenüber dem RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) äußerte sich Tiktok zu den Vorwürfen: “Wir halten uns an lokale Gesetze. Als Teil unseres lokalisierten Moderationsansatzes waren einige Begriffe, die das ASPI zur Verfügung stellte, teilweise aufgrund einschlägiger örtlicher Gesetze eingeschränkt. Andere Begriffe wurden eingeschränkt, weil sie in erster Linie bei der Suche nach pornografischen Inhalten verwendet wurden.”
- Einige Hashtags würden zudem nicht erscheinen, da sie noch nie verwendet worden seien. Des Weiteren gibt die Plattform zu, Begriffe falsch moderiert zu haben. So seien zusammengesetzte Sätze in Arabisch fälschlicherweise moderiert worden, weil “ein Teil des Satzes sich auf Pornografie beziehen könnte”. Auch seien einige englische Phrasen falsch moderiert worden. Derzeit führe man eine Überprüfung entsprechender Begriffe durch. Tiktok habe sich zudem dazu verpflichtet, seine Moderationsrichtlinien, Algorithmen und Datensicherheitspraktiken Experten zur Verfügung zu stellen.

- Es ist nicht das erste Mal, dass Tiktok für die Zensur von LGBTQ-Inhalten kritisiert wird. Bereits Ende 2019 erhielt der “Guardian” Einsicht in die Moderationspraktiken der Plattform. Demnach standen etwa in der Türkei Videos auf dem Index, die gleichgeschlechtliche Paare beim Händehalten zeigten. Auch Berichte über homosexuelle Gruppen, Charaktere, Musik und TV-Shows sollten Nutzern demnach nicht im Feed angezeigt werden. Zudem hatten mehrere Transgender-User Tiktok Anfang des Jahres vorgeworfen, ihre Inhalte zu löschen oder den Sound aus den Videos zu entfernen, wie unter anderem die BBC berichtet.
