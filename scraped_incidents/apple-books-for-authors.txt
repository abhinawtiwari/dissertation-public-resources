- Apple has launched Apple for Authors, an audiobooks service for authors to have their books narrated by artificial intelligence. The AI feature is currently only available for fiction and romance books and offers two voices, Madison and Jackson, for the listener to choose from.
- Apple has reportedly approached independent publishers in the US and Canada; those who agreed to have their work turned into an audiobook were told they would pay for the cost of production and would receive royalties from their sales.
- The new feature is said to significantly cut costs for book publishers - who typically invest thousands of dollars to produce audiobooks - and will help promote independently published authors.
- Yet some authors and publishers have been critical of the service, saying listeners want an authentic human voice that provides inflections and tones that AI software cannot generate. 'I choose humans,' bestselling author Jeff Vandermeer told Popular Science.
- According to The Guardian, the service 'may mark the beginning of the end for human narrators' and 'promises to intensify scrutiny over allegations of Apple’s anti-competitive behaviour.'

- More and more book lovers are listening to audiobooks, yet only a fraction of books are converted to audio — leaving millions of titles unheard. Many authors — especially independent authors and those associated with small publishers — aren’t able to create audiobooks due to the cost and complexity of production. Apple Books digital narration makes the creation of audiobooks more accessible to all, helping you meet the growing demand by making more books available for listeners to enjoy.
- Apple Books digital narration brings together advanced speech synthesis technology with important work by teams of linguists, quality control specialists, and audio engineers to produce high-quality audiobooks from an ebook file. Apple has long been on the forefront of innovative speech technology, and has now adapted it for long-form reading, working alongside publishers, authors, and narrators. For information on how you can take advantage of this new technology, see how to get started.
- Digitally narrated titles are a valuable complement to professionally narrated audiobooks, and will help bring audio to as many books and as many people as possible. Apple Books remains committed to celebrating and showcasing the magic of human narration and will continue to grow the human-narrated audiobook catalog.
- Our digital voices are created and optimized for specific genres. We’re starting with fiction and romance, and are accepting ebook submissions in these genres. Hear samples of voices available for these genres below, or check out the full books in our audiobooks store.
- Our nonfiction and self-development narration program is kicking off and will be available more widely in the future. You can work with our preferred partners to get updates on the timing of when these genres and others will be available for use in digital narration.

- Exclusive: tech firm quietly launches new audiobook catalogue narrated by AI – but move expected to spark backlash
- Apple has quietly launched a catalogue of books narrated by artificial intelligence in a move that may mark the beginning of the end for human narrators. The strategy marks an attempt to upend the lucrative and fast-growing audiobook market – but it also promises to intensify scrutiny over allegations of Apple’s anti-competitive behaviour.
- The popularity of the audiobook market has exploded in recent years, with technology companies scrambling to gain a foothold. Sales last year jumped 25%, bringing in more than $1.5bn. Industry insiders believe the global market could be worth more than $35bn by 2030.
- Apple was due to launch the project in mid-November, but delayed it as layoffs at Meta and chaos surrounding Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter cast a dark cloud over the technology sector.
- On the company’s Books app, searching for “AI narration” reveals the catalogue of works included in the scheme, which are described as being “narrated by digital voice based on a human narrator”.
- In recent months, Apple approached independent publishers as potential partners, including some in the Canadian market, but not all agreed to participate.
- Authors were told that Apple – which at the time was not named as the company behind the technology – would shoulder the costs of production and writers would receive royalties from sales.
- Publishers involved in the project were required to sign non-disclosure agreements – common in the technology field – but also reflective of Apple’s notorious pursuit of secrecy.
- Apple’s development of AI to narrate books could represent a significant shift in how major technology companies see the future of audiobooks.
- Publishers, authors and literary agents who spoke to the Guardian said the strategy, if successful, could have significant implications for the market.
- Others, however, were skeptical.
- “The narrator brings a whole new range of art in creating audiobook, and we believe that’s a powerful thing. They’re creating something that is different from the print book, but that adds value as an art form,” said David Caron, a co-producer at Canada’s largest audiobook publisher.
- “When you have really great writing and really talented narration, you’re coming up with something special. That’s worth investing in.”
- Before the launch, one Canadian literary agent told the Guardian she did not see the value from both a literary or customer perspective.
- “Companies see the audiobooks market and that there’s money to be made. They want to make content. But that’s all it is. It’s not what customers want to listen to. There’s so much value in the narration and the storytelling, ” said Carly Watters.
- While there is potential for backlash by professional voice actors, authors themselves are increasingly being asked to narrate their own books. There is a financial incentive for the writers, both in the upfront payments and the expanded availability of their work.
- But producing an audiobook with a human voice can take weeks and can cost publishers thousands of dollars. The lure of AI promises to significantly cut the costs.
- Still, computer-generated voices have long struggled to hold the attention of listeners for long periods of time, and to overcome the ‘uncanny valley’ effect of synthetic human speech. Human intonation and inflection are notoriously difficult to predict and replicate.
- For years, Apple has sold books and audiobooks through its Books app, and the company was rumoured to be interested in developing its own audiobooks service and shifting from a reseller to producer.
- But the move represents a direct shot at rival Amazon, with Apple listing what it said were the benefits of its own system compared to Kindle’s Direct Publishing.
- Apple and Amazon – which owns audiobook market-leader Audible – had previously indicated they were exploring AI narration technology, but Google had been the most public about its efforts and breakthroughs.
- Even before Apple’s entrance, the battle for control of the audiobook market has renewed existing feuds between major players. In recent months, Spotify, which announced plans to bring 300,000 audiobook titles to customers, has bitterly clashed with Apple over app store policies after its own app was rejected three times.
- In a newly launched site Time to Play Fair, meant to defend its position, Spotify said Apple’s “cumbersome” process for purchasing audiobooks “makes it harder for you to find your next favourite author or book”.
- It alleges Apple’s policies have meant that “in addition to consumers being hurt, authors and publishers are also being punished”.
- Apple justified the rejection by arguing that the way Spotify offers audiobooks breaches the rules surrounding online purchases and how it communicates with customers.
- While Apple already sells audiobooks, the latest move is likely to further raise questions over its anti-competitive behaviour. Lawmakers in Europe and the United States have put in place increasing scrutiny of the company in the wake of allegations that Apple limits competition.
- Apple collects a 30% fee on all services and product sales through its app store, and a recent antitrust lawsuit involving Epic Games highlighted the tight regulations surrounding the app store, as well as its immense profitability.
- Apple recently pulled in $78.13bn from its high-margin services business, which includes sales from apps, as well as its music, gaming and streaming services.

- Apple has quietly rolled out a new “digital narration” feature for its audiobooks in a move that could make human narrator jobs obsolete. The company had intended to release the AI-narrated audiobook feature on its Books app in mid-November but according to The Guardian, those plans were delayed amidst Elon Musk’s chaotic Twitter takeover and layoffs at Meta dominated headlines.
- The Books app now includes a collection of AI-narrated books which significantly cuts costs for book publishers who typically invest thousands of dollars to produce audiobooks. Apple says on its Books for Authors website that the new feature will help promote independently published authors. These authors invest in the creation of their own books either through self-publishing or hybrid publishing in which the author works with a book publisher while financially investing in marketing and production.
- Apple did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment.
- Apple approached independent publishers in the U.S. and Canada, asking if they would be interested in a potential partnership, requiring those who agreed to sign non-disclosure agreements which is common within the tech industry, The Guardian first reported.
- Authors who agreed to have their work turned into an audiobook were reportedly told they would pay for the cost of production but would receive royalties from their audiobook sales.
- Audiobook popularity has surged in recent years but companies have struggled to keep up with the high demand and the increased number of books being published. According to The Guardian, audiobook sales increased by 25% last year, bringing in more than $1.5 billion to the audiobook market. The industry is expected to reach $33.5 billion in overall revenue this year.
- Apple’s Books for Authors website says bringing AI narration to published works helps authors “meet the growing demand by making more books available for listeners to enjoy.”
- The AI-narrated feature is currently only available for fiction and romance books and offers two voices, Madison and Jackson, for the listener to choose from. Apple also says on its website that it is kicking off its AI narration for non-fiction and self-development genres, offering two AI-generated voices, Helena and Mitchell.
- However, the addition has received criticism from some publishing companies who say listeners want an authentic human voice that provides inflections and tones that AI software can not generate.
- Canadian literary agent, Carly Watters told The Guardian that AI-narrated books don’t make sense from a literary or listener perspective, saying “It’s not what customers want to listen to.” The overall value, she said, far outweighs the cost that goes into human-narrated audiobooks.

- Apple has launched a catalog of books narrated by AI, as this “may mark the beginning of the end for human narrators,” according to The Guardian. The publication says Apple was due to release this feature in mid-November, but after layoffs at Meta and Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover, the company decided to wait a bit longer as these events could “cast a dark cloud over the technology sector.”
- When searching on Apple Book for “AI narration,” users can find a small collection described as being “narrated by digital voice based on a human narrator.”
- The Guardian, then, gives a background on the project by saying that in recent months Apple had approached independent publishers as potential partners by shouldering production costs. At the same time, writers would receive royalties from sales – Apple gives 70% to artists and keeps 30%.
- While some people in the book industry thought the idea was successful, others were skeptical:
- “The narrator brings a whole new range of art in creating audiobook, and we believe that’s a powerful thing. They’re creating something that is different from the print book, but that adds value as an art form,” said David Caron, a co-producer at Canada’s largest audiobook publisher.
- Besides Apple, Google and Amazon are betting on Artificial Intelligence narratives. In addition, Spotify is expanding its music catalog to offer customers original podcasts and 300,000 audiobooks.
- As of now, it’s too soon to say how this move by Apple Books will affect the market or voice narrators. The Guardian notes that this AI future promises to significantly cut the costs, which currently take weeks for humans to narrate a book properly, as well as thousands of dollars for publishers.
- Here’s how Apple describes this new technology:
- Apple Books digital narration brings together advanced speech synthesis technology with important work by teams of linguists, quality control specialists, and audio engineers to produce high-quality audiobooks from an ebook file. Apple has long been on the forefront of innovative speech technology, and has now adapted it for long-form reading, working alongside publishers, authors, and narrators

- As the controversy over AI art rumbles on, Apple has announced the first AI-generated audiobooks are now available via its digital bookstore.
- The company has made the technology available to authors, who may not have the means to convert their written work to the audiobook format.
- The Apple Books digital narration feature has been quietly launched on the Apple Books for Authors webpage, which lauds the ability for independent authors to easily convert their books to audio without great cost or complexity.
- “Apple Books digital narration brings together advanced speech synthesis technology with important work by teams of linguists, quality control specialists, and audio engineers to produce high-quality audiobooks from an ebook file,” the company says.
- Apple’s new feature allows users to select from a range of AI-generated voices, which are optimised for specific genres. Right now, it’s available for the romance fiction genres, but more will follow in due course. Users will be able to identify these titles by a ‘Narrated by Apple Books’ label within the storefront.
- For authors it may mean more sales from those who prefer to listen rather than read. However, the scheme is sure to meet opposition from voice actors who may worry for the future of their profession, and from audiobook patrons who prefer a natural human voice.
- Apple says the technology will work alongside narrators, while ensuring audiobooks become more accessible to all. Considering only a fraction of books are ever converted to the audio format, they’re may be room for both. However, the creeping influence of cheap AI tech, at the expense of human artists, is a natural cause for concern.
- “Digitally narrated titles are a valuable complement to professionally narrated audiobooks,” the company adds, perhaps anticipating the blowback, “and will help bring audio to as many books and as many people as possible. Apple Books remains committed to celebrating and showcasing the magic of human narration and will continue to grow the human-narrated audiobook catalog.”

- At a time when there is a lot of debate going on around ChatGPT and generative AI potentially eating up jobs, Apple has launched AI-powered audio narration for select titles on Apple Books. On its website for authors, the company says that this feature will help independent authors who might not be able to convert their titles to audiobooks because of “the cost and complexity of production.”
- Currently, only select titles are narrated by Apple’s own AI-generated voices. Users will see “Apple Books” in the narrator section for these titles.
- Image Credits: Apple
- Image Credits: Apple
- While Apple says the program is for independent authors, currently they have to sign up with partner publishing companies — Draft2Digital or Ingram CoreSource — to get their book narrated by Apple’s AI voices.
- Apple is already accepting submissions under the romance and fiction genres — with support for only literary, historical, and women’s fiction at the moment — through the partners mentioned above. Plus, it is starting its AI-powered voice narration work for nonfiction and self-development genres. Currently, Apple offers four voices under soprano and baritone categories: Madison and Jackson (romance and fiction); Helena and Mitchell (self-development and nonfiction). The company said that these voices are trained in specific genres, but Apple didn’t specify what training data it is using to tune them.
- “Apple Books digital narration brings together advanced speech synthesis technology with important work by teams of linguists, quality control specialists, and audio engineers to produce high-quality audiobooks from an ebook file. Apple Books has long been on the forefront of innovative speech technology and has now adapted it for long-form reading, working alongside publishers, authors, and narrators,” Apple said on its website.
- If you look at audiobook titles on the Apple Book store, they are often narrated by the author with other guests or voice artists pitching in at times. Apple’s AI-generation suit probably aims to remove any need for sitting down and recording the narration in a studio. But even with this process, results are not instant. The Cupertino-based company said that once an author submits a request, it takes “one to two months to process the book and conduct quality checks.”
- Apple specified that if there is not enough time for post-production checks, the title is published as soon as the processing is completed. However, the company didn’t provide any details on what might be the shortcomings of such a rushed process and how the final might sound.
- It’s not clear if authors are allowed to port their Apple AI-powered audiobooks to other platforms. We have asked Apple for a comment, and we will update the story if we hear back.
- A report from The Guardian noted that Apple wanted to release this feature last November, but it got delayed because of industry-wide layoffs and the Elon Musk–Twitter drama.
- Most platforms — apart from Audible — allow books that are narrated by AI-generated voices. However, Apple’s entry into the market might attract a lot of attention to platforms such as Matrix-backed Murf that allow creators to make AI-powered audiobooks. At the moment, there’s no detail about how much Apple is charging publishers (or authors) for the whole process of converting a book into an audiobook.
- Apple is getting pushback from regulators about App Store fees, and it might have to allow alternative app stores and third-party payment options that might have an impact on its revenue. So when generative AI is having its moment, Apple is taking the first steps toward making it a viable cash-generating option.

- Although computer programs have long been able to read text aloud, their performances aren’t exactly known to be compelling. As AI capabilities continue to rapidly advance, however, the potential for more nuanced and “human-like” narration is more possible than ever. That possibility received a major expansion this week from Apple with its announcement of a new AI service capable of generating realistic human narration for audiobooks.
- But while the company claims the program will benefit independent authors previously unable to pursue the publishing option due to “the cost and complexity of production,” some writers and publishing insiders are expressing reservations about the prospect of taking actual actors out of the equation.
- [Related: AI vocal filters are here to stay.]
- “Digitally narrated titles are a valuable complement to professionally narrated audiobooks, and will help bring audio to as many books and as many people as possible,” Apple argues in its new service’s announcement, while also promising to continue “celebrating and showcasing the magic of human narration” while still growing its human-narrated audiobook catalog.
- Meanwhile, authors like Jeff VanderMeer, the writer behind the bestselling Southern Reach and Borne science fiction series, don’t believe the hype.
- “I believe in voice talent and what each voice actor or reader brings to it. If it weren’t frowned upon, I would work with the voice actor to alter my novels to make them more perfect for the medium,” VanderMeer wrote to Popular Science over Twitter on Thursday. “The folks who have [narrated] my books sometimes ask questions, they adjust how they read based on discussions, and it feels collaborative. I learn something about my fiction from the process.”
- For now, Apple offers authors four different AI narrators trained to orate certain fiction genres alongside non-fiction and self-help books. To start an audio project, customers first need to sign up with one of two partner publishing companies, Draft2Digital or Ingram CoreSource. Customers can then expect finished products within one-to-two months following audio generation and quality checks, but will only be able to sell the releases via Apple Books as well as distributing to public and academic libraries. That said, a publisher or author still retains audiobook rights, and will face no restrictions on making and distributing other versions of the audiobook in the future.
- [Related: A startup is using AI to make call centers sound more ‘American.’]
- Apple is enduring increasing pressure from businesses and regulators regarding its longstanding App Store developer fees and other anti-competitive strategies, and may actually soon be forced to revise its stance on the subject. As such, some see the new service as less a new form of artistic support, and more an attempt to find revenue elsewhere. “Companies see the audiobooks market and that there’s money to be made. They want to make content. But that’s all it is,” literary agent Carly Watters argued to The Guardian on Wednesday. “It’s not what customers want to listen to. There’s so much value in the narration and the storytelling.”
- For authors like VanderMeer, their audio releases will also maintain their human qualities, even if their subject matter often veers into the fantastical and surreal. “Inasmuch as I contractually am able to choose who reads my books for audiobooks, I choose human beings,” he writes. “I believe it’s a talent and a creative skill.”

- Apple has detailed how its AI-powered digital narration for books will expand, but says it is "committed to celebrating" human-read audiobooks too.  In early January 2023, Apple Books very quietly release myriad audiobooks with full narration —  and not one single narrator. Instead of actors reading the books, the audio was created entirely through AI.Now in a new support document intended to help authors use this new capability of Apple Books, Apple stresses that it's not intended to get rid of actors.

- The global audiobooks market size was valued at USD 4,219.0 million in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.4% from 2022 to 2030.There's nothing "holding back" the audiobook market, as these growth numbers far outstrip growth in traditional publishing and ebooks. I have nothing personally against Apple (or anyone) using AI-based narrators, but as is typical of Apple and its maudlin, truth-stretching, self-celebratory press release language, their motivations for pursuing AI-based readings is avoiding SAG-AFTRA union rates for narrators. It's expensive to commission a reading for a book where the author and/or publisher has chosen not to pursue an audiobook as a first-party effort, and Apple's share of the ebook and audiobook markets is miniscule and falling (I work in book publishing). It's a purely practical/financial move for them to sidestep the traditional process in order to offer a "competitive" catalog against much, much larger competitors (e.g. Audible).

- Neoncat, interesting info I long suspected was true. After the court case it was like Apple dropped investment in ebooks for quite a while. It is only with iOS16 there has been any significant update to the Books app. I find I have shifted to more and more to kindle ebooks over the years.In the world of both ebooks and audiobooks I can see Apple struggling, particularly audiobooks with most of those being Audible titles in Books with very high price tags. Amazon, which happens to own Audible, is in total control.  I suspect Audible has bought up the rights to most existing audiobooks from publishers. It also offers via kindle an Audible top up to the kindle ebook for many titles, for around $2-$4 that can be listened to via either the Kindle App or the Audible App. And a subscription service. Interestingly, for audiobooks I prefer the kindle book with audio top up in Kindle App as it is usually the cheapest option, and easy to swap between reading and listening. And the combined package is still usually cheaper than the audiobook alone via Apple Books.How can Apple compete with that or muscle in when no doubt Audible has most rights? While I agree it isn’t good for narrators, the  use of AI might be a solution to reintroduce competition in the audiobook market (even the ebook market), and could even increase revenue for authors, and seems to be targeting them with this AI technology.  Supply and demand and their relationship to price and all that.

While I agree it isn’t good for narrators, the  use of AI might be a solution to reintroduce competition in the audiobook market (even the ebook market), and could even increase revenue for authors, and seems to be targeting them with this AI technology.  Supply and demand and their relationship to price and all that.

- Apple's digital storefronts now offer audiobooks recorded by artificial narrators instead of humans in a sound booth. The audiobooks are listed in the Books app as "Narrated by Apple Books."
- Clicking on the information icon next to that line brings up a text box that clarifies the book is narrated by "a digital voice based on a human narrator." There are multiple digital voices across the Apple Books library, with names like "Madison" or "Jackson"—but each book is offered with just one of them.
- 
- Based on our searches (you can type "AI narration" into the Books search field to see a list), many publications in question are mostly low-volume books from small publishers, like lesser-known genres or romance novels.
- According to The Guardian, Apple reached out to independent book publishers over the past several months and told them it would front the cost of the digital recordings but pay authors royalties on sales. Some publishers agreed, and others didn't. But this is likely just the start of Apple's effort, and more may be added later. Apple probably won't be the only company to do it, either. Google and Amazon—also major purveyors of both ebooks and audiobooks—have publicly talked about this possibility before.
- Audiobooks are a huge business; their sales and popularity have skyrocketed in recent years. But even as some independent publishers and self-published authors have thrived, audiobooks have mostly been a market for major publishers and, yes, tech platforms.
- One potential upside of this development is the availability of audiobooks for publications and authors that might not have had a budget for audio versions. However, as with so many AI applications lately, this development raises questions about what might happen to human narrators working in the business—as well as concerns over who benefits most. If AI narrators become something readers commonly accept and enjoy, it could increase the leverage Apple and other tech companies have over publishers and authors who want as many people as possible to see or hear their work.

- Apple quietly launched a series of audiobooks narrated by artificial intelligence, which not only challenges Amazon’s hold on the market but also suggests the audiobook industry is on the cusp of substantial change.
The AI-generated voice narration is currently available for romance and fiction books written in English on the Apple Books app. Four voices are available for publishers and authors to attach to their books, two optimized for the romance and fiction genres (“Madison” and “Jackson”), and two for non-fiction (“Helena” and “Mitchell”). A search for “AI narration” on the Books app reveals hundred of audiobooks using Apple’s new technology.
Human narrators are expensive, so the technology will make audiobook production more accessible to independent and indie publishers, according to Apple’s website. Apple does not disclose how much it charges, and the company did not respond to the Observer’s request for an interview.
Audible, Amazon’s audiobook service, “is by far the biggest audiobook narration entity in existence, and so Apple is really going head to head with Amazon on this,” said Miles Chicoine, founder and CEO of Voquent, a voice-over service that connects voice narrators with audiobook clients. While Amazon owns an AI voice-over service, which narrates the Washington Post’s articles, it currently doesn’t allow non-human narration on Audible. It won’t be able to compete with the cheap narration publishers can get by using Apple’s technology.
While audiobook listeners may appreciate more selections and lower prices, voice robots threaten the actors who have traditionally voiced audiobooks. Voice actors typically charge more than $1,000—and sometimes much more—to narrate a book, while AI narration costs $50 to $100 total, Chicoine said.
The AI narration is produced by voice actors recording 50,000 to 100,000 individual words that are assembled into sentences by AI-powered software. It sounds human-like, but it still lacks the rhythm, pace and inflection unique to human narration, said Chicoine. A voice actor can bring emotion and subtext that technology can’t, as well as unexpected pronunciation choices that give an audiobook a personality. But as the technology advances and becomes more human-sounding, experts say it will take away opportunities from voice actors.
The current audiobook market is worth $5.36 billion, and it is expected to reach $35 billion by 2030, according to a report by Research and Markets, a market data collector. In 2021, 74,000 audiobooks were published, up 4 percent from 2020 and up 21 percent from 2010. Totals for 2022 haven’t been released yet, but revenues show a similar upward trend. In 2021, audiobook sales totaled $1.6 billion, up from $1.3 billion the year prior.
AI narration is both a threat and an opportunity
For voice actors and other audio industry workers, “AI is the elephant in the room,” Chicoine said. It is cheaper, faster and more accessible than human narrators, so the technology has the potential to eat a share of available jobs. For the next five to 10 years, established professionals will be able to find work, but it will be more difficult for those looking to break into the industry, Chicoine said.
Voice actors have been talking about AI for years, said Elisabeth Rodgers, who has been working as a voice actress since 2006. She records two to three books each month for Audible and other companies, and she estimates 90 percent of her income stems from audiobook narration. “It’s scary because it’s my living,” she said of the AI threat.
Voice narrators could make money by recording their voice to become AI. They are paid between $5,000 and $6,000 for taping 100,000 words, which is low for an experienced voice actor but high for beginners, said Mony Raanan, founder and CEO of Voice Crafters, an agency and voice actor marketplace. But actors can “shoot themselves in the foot by doing this,” he said. Depending on a narrator’s contract, they might receive a flat payment rather than being paid based on usage, which means their voice could be played in any audiobook—including a  best-seller—without being compensated for it. When actors are paid each time a publisher or company uses their AI-created voice, it could be a huge money-making opportunity, he said.
Voice Crafters is preparing for the AI wave by building a database of actors who have recorded to become an AI voice and tapping into this pool when their clients ask for an actor. If a requested narrator is sick or doesn’t have time for a project, their automated voice could be used. 
Voquent, the voice-over service, receives three to four requests for AI voice projects each day, which is about 10 percent of its incoming daily requests, its CEO Chicoine said. Demand for AI voice-over work isn’t yet outstripping the growth in demand for human narration, so he expects it will grow the market rather than hurt it.
“Once people get involved at the low level, they’ll be more willing to pay for a human voice actor,” he said. “We are a long way from voice artists being a dying breed.”

It is cheaper, faster and more accessible than human narrators, so the technology has the potential to eat a share of available jobs. For the next five to 10 years, established professionals will be able to find work, but it will be more difficult for those looking to break into the industry, Chicoine said.
Voice actors have been talking about AI for years, said Elisabeth Rodgers, who has been working as a voice actress since 2006. She records two to three books each month for Audible and other companies, and she estimates 90 percent of her income stems from audiobook narration. “It’s scary because it’s my living,” she said of the AI threat.
Voice narrators could make money by recording their voice to become AI. They are paid between $5,000 and $6,000 for taping 100,000 words, which is low for an experienced voice actor but high for beginners, said Mony Raanan, founder and CEO of Voice Crafters, an agency and voice actor marketplace. But actors can “shoot themselves in the foot by doing this,” he said. Depending on a narrator’s contract, they might receive a flat payment rather than being paid based on usage, which means their voice could be played in any audiobook—including a  best-seller—without being compensated for it. When actors are paid each time a publisher or company uses their AI-created voice, it could be a huge money-making opportunity, he said.
Voice Crafters is preparing for the AI wave by building a database of actors who have recorded to become an AI voice and tapping into this pool when their clients ask for an actor. If a requested narrator is sick or doesn’t have time for a project, their automated voice could be used. 
Voquent, the voice-over service, receives three to four requests for AI voice projects each day, which is about 10 percent of its incoming daily requests, its CEO Chicoine said. Demand for AI voice-over work isn’t yet outstripping the growth in demand for human narration, so he expects it will grow the market rather than hurt it.
“Once people get involved at the low level, they’ll be more willing to pay for a human voice actor,” he said. “We are a long way from voice artists being a dying breed.”

- You can't beat settling in for a gripping audiobook narrated by the likes of Stephen Fry, George Guidall or Juliet Stevenson.
- But in the future, will humans still be the most popular storytellers or will robots end up dominating the booming industry?
- Well Apple clearly thinks there's a market for the latter as it has quietly launched a catalogue of books that are narrated by artificial intelligence.
- This new feature is just the start of what will be a fierce battle with the likes of Amazon and Spotify for an industry that insiders think could be worth more than $35 billion (£29 billion) by 2030.
- Robot readers: Apple has launched a catalogue of books that are narrated by artificial intelligence
- You can find the robot-voiced audiobooks, which use text-to-speech translation, by searching for 'AI narration' on Apple's Books app.
- There are two types of AI voice available to choose from, both of which have an American accent and speak only in English.
- The first is a soprano called Madison and the second a baritone voice called Jackson.
- What's clear from the robotic, artificial quality of Apple's AI voices is that they won't be replacing the warm, dulcet tones of Fry any time soon, but as the technology develops they could become more human-like in the future.
- You can find the robot-voiced audiobooks, which use text-to-speech translation, by searching for 'AI narration' on Apple's Books app.
- This brings up a list of romance or fiction books (both free and paid for) that are described as being 'narrated by digital voice based on a human narrator'.
- There are two types of AI voice available to choose from, both of which have an American accent and speak only in English.
- The first is a soprano called Madison and the second a baritone voice called Jackson, although two more voices, Helena and Mitchell, are on the way for non-fiction books.
- The company said it had used the advanced speech synthesis technology it developed 'to produce high-quality audiobooks from an ebook file'.
- The hope from those in favour of AI-narrated audio books is that it could open up a new market to publishers and authors who'd previously been unable to afford moving from print to audio.
- This in turn could lead to a huge growth in the number of audiobooks available to readers, with Apple claiming that digital narration technology will make creating audiobooks more accessible.
- According to the Guardian, Apple approached independent publishers to see if they would be interested in working together on the project.
- This new feature is just the start of what will be a fierce battle with the likes of Amazon and Spotify for an industry that insiders think could be worth more than $35 billion (£29 billion) by 2030. Pictured is an Amazon Kindle
- The tech giant kept its involvement secret but authors were reportedly told that the company behind the technology would shoulder the costs of turning their books into audiobooks and that they would be earning royalties.
- Apple's website also says that publishers and authors retain audiobook rights, and can put out other versions of the audiobook if they choose.
- The company's approach to digital narration is the opposite of rival Amazon's, whose Audible rules explicitly state that submitted audiobooks 'must be narrated by a human'.
- 
- And despite the hope of Apple and others who support such AI narration, some are more skeptical.
- David Caron, a co-producer at Canada's largest audiobook publisher, told the Guardian: 'The narrator brings a whole new range of art in creating audiobook, and we believe that’s a powerful thing.
- 'They're creating something that is different from the print book, but that adds value as an art form.'

- Many families with young children now own a tablet and some use them for bedtime stories or as an educational tool to help youngsters learn.
- But a new study suggests that it may be time to ditch the devices for such use, after finding that children actually engage more with stories if they're read from a real book.
- Researchers in the US compared the use of tablets with traditional children's books in a study involving 72 parents with young children aged 24 to 36 months.
- They found that parents talked more to their children when reading them a real book, while children also responded more to this conversation than if a tablet was used.
