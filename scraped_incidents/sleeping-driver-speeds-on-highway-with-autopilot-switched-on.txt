- September 17, 2020   Ponoka , Alberta
- News release
- On Thursday, July 9, at approximately 4 p.m., Alberta RCMP received a complaint of a car speeding south on Highway 2 near Ponoka. The car appeared to be self-driving, travelling over 140 km/h, with both front seats completely reclined and both occupants appearing to be asleep.
- An Alberta RCMP Traffic Services member located the vehicle, a 2019 Tesla Model S. After the responding Officer activated emergency lights on their vehicle, the Tesla automatically began to accelerate. The Officer was able to obtain radar readings on the vehicle, confirming that it had automatically accelerated up to exactly 150 km/h. After pulling over the vehicle, RCMP charged the driver, a 20-year-old male from British Columbia, with speeding and a 24-hour licence suspension for fatigue.
- After further investigation and consultation with Crown Counsel, a Criminal Code charge of Dangerous Driving was laid against the driver, who was served with a summons for court in December.
- "Although manufacturers of new vehicles have built in safeguards to prevent drivers from taking advantage of the new safety systems in vehicles, those systems are just that — supplemental safety systems," says Superintendent Gary Graham of Alberta RCMP Traffic Services. "They are not self-driving systems, they still come with the responsibility of driving."

- Canadian police have charged a 20-year-old man with dangerous driving after he was arrested for allegedly being asleep at the wheel of a 2019 Tesla Model S while it was operating in its semi-autonomous “Autopilot” mode.
- The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said it received a complaint of a car speeding near Ponoka, Alberta at around 4 pm on July 9.
- The vehicle was traveling at more than 140 km (86.9 miles) per hour, with both front seats “completely reclined and both occupants appearing to be asleep,” the RCMP said.
- When a police officer approached the vehicle with emergency lights the Tesla “automatically began to accelerate” to 150 km (93.2 m) per hour, the RCMP said.
- After pulling him over, the officer charged the driver, who is from British Columbia, with speeding and suspended his license for 24 hours. After further investigation, police charged him with dangerous driving and he is summoned to appear in court in December.
- “Although manufacturers of new vehicles have built in safeguards to prevent drivers from taking advantage of the new safety systems in vehicles, those systems are just that – supplemental safety systems,” Superintendent Gary Graham of Alberta RCMP Traffic Services said. “They are not self-driving systems, they still come with the responsibility of driving.”
- Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.
- 4 insane things just happened to Tesla
- The company has been adamant that drivers maintain control of the vehicle while the Autopilot system is in use, with a warning before it is first used saying drivers must keep their hands on the steering wheel and be prepared to take over at any time.
- While Autopilot can keep the vehicle in a highway lane and maintain distance from traffic, it is not a fully autonomous system and still requires driver oversight.
- But it is not the first time the car manufacturer and Autopilot have been embroiled in a traffic incident – though the company has defended the technology.
- Last year, a 50-year-old man died in a car crash after switching from manual mode to Autopilot, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).
- And in 2018, Apple employee Walter Huang died when his car veered off a highway to the left, accelerated and crashed before bursting into flames. The Autopilot feature had been engaged for nearly 19 minutes, the NTSB found. His family announced last year they were suing Tesla, claiming the feature caused his death.
- At the time, Tesla said that the only way the vehicle could have crashed is if Huang had not “paid attention” to the road, “despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so.”
- Another man, Joshua Brown, died in May 2016 when his Tesla crashed into a tractor-trailer in Florida while the software was active.

- Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.
- Surely there are far more relaxing places to get some shut-eye.
- A 20-year-old Tesla driver in Canada was slapped with reckless driving charges this week after being caught sound asleep behind the wheel — while going 93 miles per hour on his car’s infamous autopilot function.
- Police in Alberta received calls on July 9 from shocked and disturbed drivers who reported seeing a 2019 Tesla Model S zooming down the highway, near the town of Ponoka, in which no driver appeared to be present. Both front seats were apparently reclined.
- Officers have just now charged the unnamed driver for speeding and dangerous driving, and suspended their license for 24 hours. A court date has been set for December.
- “Nobody was looking out the windshield to see where the car was going,” Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sgt. Darri Turnbull told CBC News.
- In an official statement, the Alberta law enforcement said, “We received a complaint of a car speeding on Highway 2 near Ponoka. The car appeared to be self-driving, traveling over 140 kmh with both front seats completely reclined and occupants appeared to be asleep.”
- They added, “The driver received a dangerous driving charge and summons for court.”
- Police also said the vehicle appeared to accelerate, from 140 kmh to 150 kmh, as they made their pursuit.
- Tesla’s autopilot function is designed to steer, accelerate and brake on the driver’s behalf, but the carmaker insists on their website that these features “[do] not make the vehicle autonomous.” Motorists are urged to remain alert and keep their hands on the wheel.
- When enabling autopilot in a Tesla, drivers are required to agree to terms such as “keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times” and “maintain control and responsibility for your car.”
- “Once engaged, if insufficient torque is applied, autopilot will also deliver an escalating series of visual and audio warnings, reminding you to place your hands on the wheel … If you repeatedly ignore these warnings, you will be locked out from using autopilot during that trip,” the Tesla website claims.
- There are also several features that may impair autopilot function, such as inclement weather, bright lights and road obstructions.
- “I’ve been in policing for over 23 years,” said Turnbull, “and the majority of that in traffic law enforcement, and I’m speechless. I’ve never, ever seen anything like this before but, of course, the technology wasn’t there.”

- A Canadian man has been charged with dangerous driving for allegedly taking a nap while his self-driving Tesla car clocked up more than 90mph (150km/h).
- Police said both front seats were fully reclined, and the driver and passenger were apparently asleep when they were alerted to the incident in Alberta.
- When police turned on emergency lights and other vehicles moved out of the way, the Tesla Model S sped up.
- The 20-year-old driver from British Columbia is due in court in December.
- He had initially been charged with speeding and handed a 24-hour licence suspension for fatigue, but was subsequently charged with dangerous driving.
- The incident happened near Ponoka, some 100km south of Edmonton, in July.
- "Nobody was looking out the windshield to see where the car was going," Police Sgt Darri Turnbull told CBC News.
- He said that when they put on their emergency lights the Tesla accelerated, with vehicles ahead of it moving out of the way.
- "Nobody appeared to be in the car, but the vehicle sped up because the line was clear in front."
- He added: "I've been in policing for over 23 years, and the majority of that in traffic law enforcement, and I'm speechless. I've never, ever seen anything like this before but of course the technology wasn't there."
- Tesla cars currently operate at a level-two Autopilot, which requires the driver to remain alert and ready to act, with hands on the wheel.
- Tesla founder Elon Musk has said he expects his vehicles to be completely autonomous, with little driver input needed, by the end of the year.
- However, he added that there were "many small problems" that would need solving through real-world testing.

- By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.
- A Tesla Model S owner in Alberta, Canada, was charged with dangerous driving after being pulled over for sleeping while traveling at speeds of 150 km/h (93 mph). The case raises questions about Tesla’s partially automated driving system, Autopilot, and driver complacency.
- On July 9th, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they received a complaint of reckless driving on Highway 2 near Ponoka in Alberta. The 2019 Tesla Model S “appeared to be self-driving,” police said, “traveling over 140 km/h, with both front seats completely reclined and both occupants appearing to be asleep.”
- Officers began to pursue the vehicle with their emergency lights flashing, at which point the vehicle “automatically began to accelerate,” eventually reaching a speed of 150 km/h, police said. After pulling over the vehicle, the driver, a 21-year-old male from British Columbia, was charged with speeding and driving while fatigued, resulting in a 24-hour license suspension. Later, the man was also charged with dangerous driving.
- “Both front seats completely reclined and both occupants appearing to be asleep”
- “Although manufacturers of new vehicles have built in safeguards to prevent drivers from taking advantage of the new safety systems in vehicles, those systems are just that — supplemental safety systems,” Superintendent Gary Graham of Alberta RCMP Traffic Services said in a statement. “They are not self-driving systems, they still come with the responsibility of driving.”
- A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Autopilot is a Level 2 partially autonomous system that combines adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, self-parking, and, most recently, the ability to automatically change lanes. It uses a suite of sensors, including eight cameras, radar, and ultrasonic, to automate some of the driving tasks, but it also requires drivers to stay engaged with the vehicle in order to operate.
- The automaker’s Autopilot system has been proven by traffic investigators to have contributed to a number of fatal crashes in the past, and the families of deceased drivers have sued Tesla for wrongful death.
- Tesla CEO Elon Musk has blamed crashes involving Autopilot on driver overconfidence. “When there is a serious accident it is almost always, in fact maybe always, the case that it is an experienced user, and the issue is more one of complacency,” Musk said in 2018. But by marketing its system as “Autopilot,” Tesla has been shown to encourage driver inattention.
- It’s unclear to what extent the Tesla owner in Canada was misusing Autopilot. Tesla has said the advanced driver assist system will only work when it detects a driver’s hands on the steering wheel. If a driver’s hands aren’t detected, the display behind the wheel will begin to flash, followed by audible warnings, and eventually, Autopilot will disable itself.
- Since its launch in 2015, Tesla owners have sought out new and creative ways to trick Autopilot. People couldn’t wait to upload videos sitting in the backseat while their cars drove “autonomously” down the highway. Tesla responded by updating its software to require drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel — which seemed like a smart fix until one driver figured out all you needed to do to fool the system was wedge an orange against the wheel to simulate the pressure of a human hand.
- “Autopilot Buddy” was a piece of magnetic plastic that attaches to the steering wheel in order to create the impression that the driver is keeping his or her hands there. Federal regulators issued a cease and desist order to prevent its sale.
- People love tricking technology, even if it could cost them their lives.

- The driver appeared to be sleeping while his Tesla cruised at 65 mph on Autopilot.
- A Tesla driver was filmed asleep at the wheel in a Model S sedan apparently cruising on its own down California's 405 freeway with its Autopilot semi-autonomous feature enabled. The story was picked up—and sensationalized—by the local NBC station, which reports that the Tesla not-driver is alleged to have traveled 30 miles down the 405 while napping.
- Just as when Autopilot first came out and people put videos of themselves climbing out of the driver's seat and into the passenger or rear seats while the car seemingly drove itself, this is monumentally stupid and bad for a variety of reasons. First and most important is this: In spite of its name, Autopilot isn't a full self-driving system. Instead, it encompasses the relatively ordinary (and widely available) pairing of adaptive cruise control and a lane-keeping system that steers the car within lane markers. Sure, Tesla's self-steering function is among the better and more ambitious ones out on the market today. Mostly this is because it's allowed more leeway to steer the car than many of Tesla's competitors allow in their vehicles; for example, Mercedes-Benz has similar technology but deliberately doesn't allow it to function in as many scenarios—or handle turns as sharp—as boundary-pushing Tesla does.
- Either way, Tesla is adamant that drivers using Autopilot in its vehicles must remain present and aware, lest they need to retake control at any moment. In our experience with Autopilot, the need to retake control really can happen at any moment—sometimes, it's because there is a traffic scenario developing ahead that the car's computers simply can't figure out. Other times, Autopilot itself seems to go to sleep, steering the car in odd or unexpected directions. The point is this: Autopilot isn't perfect, Tesla doesn't officially view it as such, and a driver can't simply nod off while using the system. After all, Autopilot cannot read or respond to road signs, read or respond to traffic signals, and more.
- Stupider still, this wasn't some case of a driver, lulled by boredom, falling asleep while the car did all of the work. Tesla's Autopilot system has a fail-safe designed to keep driver inattention at bay, a torque sensor on the steering wheel that, if the wheel isn't touched or handled for a period of time, instigates the driver to retake control and defeats Autopilot. So how did this guy in California sleep for 30 miles, hands off the wheel, you ask? He hacked it. Intentionally. Per the citizen who recorded the incident, there appeared to be something tied to the Tesla's steering wheel. This is a well-known hack for Autopilot (and other self-steering systems), in which a user straps something mildly weighty (a soda can, a beanbag, whatever) to the steering-wheel rim to trick the system into thinking there's a hand on the wheel, thus defeating its hands-on-the-wheel safety net and allowing (theoretically) endless hands-off driving.
- Endless, that is, until the car's cameras and radar sensors lose purchase on the Tesla's surroundings, or that thing tied to the wheel falls off and the car leaves the road and slams into something, or meets any of the other grim outcomes there could be for a rudderless car traveling at highway speeds. Self-driving cars don't yet exist, not in Tesla form, not in any form—and barely in experimental form. So, although it should go without saying: always pay attention while driving, even while using driver-assistance features like Autopilot. Not least because some rightfully concerned citizen will film you and report your license plate number to the police, as happened here.

- A Tesla driver’s case over sleeping while using Autopilot on the highway is going to trial for dangerous driving in what legal experts are calling a legal first.
- Earlier this year, we reported on the Alberta RCMP (Canada federal police) issuing a report on a strange incident involving a Tesla vehicle on Autopilot:
- “Alberta RCMP received a complaint of a car speeding on Highway 2 near Ponoka. The car appeared to be self-driving, traveling over 140 km/h with both front seats completely reclined and occupants appeared to be asleep.”
- Tesla’s Autopilot enables virtually autonomous driving on the highway, but drivers are required to keep their hands on the steering wheel and be ready to take control at all times.
- The automaker tries to enforce that by requiring drivers to apply slight torque to the wheel on frequent intervals, but there are ways to get around that by adding weights to the steering wheel.
- It’s unclear if that’s what the driver, Leran Cai, a 20-year-old, did in this case.
- We reported that the police charged him criminally for dangerous driving over the incident, and now, we learned that the case is actually going to court.
- Global News reports:
- “In what Canadian legal experts are calling an unprecedented case, a B.C. man has been charged with dangerous driving in Alberta after he was allegedly caught sleeping in a self-driving Tesla as it sped south on Highway 2 between Edmonton and Calgary this past summer.”
- They added about Cai’s charges:
- “On top of the criminal charge, Cai is accused of speeding and RCMP said he also received a 24-hour licence suspension for fatigue in connection with the alleged July 9 incident, in which drivers and police noticed a 2019 Tesla Model S operating with no driver in sight.”
- Cai’s next court appearance is set for Jan. 29, 2021, in Ponoka, and the case will be followed closely as it could set a precedent.
- I think this is going to be a quick one. Cai was obviously abusing the driver-assist system and being dangerous.
- He could potentially try to get away with it by claiming that he thought Tesla Autopilot was fully autonomous, but that would be hard to claim with all of Tesla’s warnings about Autopilot, including right when you activate it.
- I am sure you wouldn’t be shocked if I told you that Cai has a long history of driving violations, especially for someone who has only been driving for a few years.
- According to Global News’ report, he was convicted of driving without a driver’s licence just last year.

- Police in Canada have charged a man with speeding and dangerous driving after he was found asleep at the wheel of his self-driving car as it travelled at 150km/h down a highway in the province of Alberta.
- Announcing the charges on Thursday, the Royal Canadian Mounted police said that on 9 July they received a complaint that a Model S Tesla vehicle was speeding on the highway near the town of Ponoka.
- “The car appeared to be self-driving, traveling over 140km/h, with both front seats completely reclined and both occupants appearing to be asleep,” the RCMP said in a statement.
- After the police flashed their lights, however, the Tesla electric vehicle reportedly sped up to “exactly” 150km/h, according to police. The speed limit on most of Canada’s highway network is 110km/h.
- The driver, a 20-year-old man from neighbouring British Columbia, was charged with speeding and given a 24-hour license suspension for driving while fatigued.
- The province has also decided to charge the driver with dangerous driving, and he is due to appear in court in December.
- The proliferation of self-driving vehicles, pioneered by the electric car company Tesla, has posed a challenge for regulators trying to determine the safety and effectiveness of the on-board systems.
- In January, an Ontario driver was charged with reckless driving after officers spotted him using both hands to floss his teeth as his vehicle sped along the highway at 135 km/h.
- Two months earlier a Tesla vehicle was spotted driving on the wrong side of the road – without a driver.
- And in the United States, officials are investigating a number of fatal crashes involving the “autopilot” function, including one in which the driver was using the feature to play on his phone.
- “Although manufacturers of new vehicles have built-in safeguards to prevent drivers from taking advantage of the new safety systems in vehicles, those systems are just that – supplemental safety systems,” RCMP superintendent Gary Graham said in the statement. “They are not self-driving systems. They still come with the responsibility of driving.”
