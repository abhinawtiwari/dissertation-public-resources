- Hewlett Packard (HP) has been accused of racism after a man complained in a video that its webcam facial tracking software successfully followed a white face to keep it centered, but failed to follow a black face.
- The African American man, referred to as 'Desi,' demonstrates on the video how the tracking software would not follow his face but would track that of his white co-worker.
- HP responded by saying it uses 'standard algorithms' to measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose, and that the camera might have difficulty 'seeing' contrast where there is insufficient foreground lighting.
- The video quickly went viral; it has been viewed over 3 million times at the time of writing this article.
- In 2010, Gadgetwise reported that the Xbox Kinect failed to recognise the faces of dark-skinned gamers, something Microsoft later attributed to a light sensor which performed poorly in low light conditions.

- HP did a good job responding to complaints by a black man that its computers “are racist” because the included PC facial recognition software did not follow his face properly.
- The statement was made in a YouTube video posted on Dec. 10 that went viral over the weekend, attracting newly 100,000 views.
- The video shows what is described as an HP webcam following a white face to keep it centered, but failing to follow a black face.
- The company did not overreact to the racial element, treating the issue, basically, as a help desk problem. It promised to look into a solution. How many other companies would have handled this so well?
- In the world of social networks, these sorts of crises are going to become more and more common. To his credit, Desi–subject of the video–did it with good humor. Once the video went viral, HP was quick to respond.
- His racism statement was said not quite in jest, but not in anger, either. He clearly has a valid complaint about the software and made a pretty funny video to demonstrate.
- Here’s the gist of a blog post, by HP Community Manager Tony “Frosty” Welch, responding to the video:
- “Some of you may have seen or heard of a YouTube video in which the facial-tracking software didn’t work for a customer. We thank Desi, and the people who have seen and commented on his video, for bringing this subject to our attention.
- “We are working with our partners to learn more. The technology we use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose. We believe that the camera might have difficulty “seeing” contrast in conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting. While we work on this, take a look here for more information on the impact of lighting on facial tracking software, and how to optimize your webcam experience:  http://bit.ly/7HsZHD
- “We will continue to listen to you and work to deliver great experiences. We invite you to connect with us on the discussion boards and forums here on The Next Bench or on Twitter at @HP_PC. “
- That is a darn near perfect response. Before the quoted passages, Tony talked a bit about diversity at HP and its commitment to great experiences for all (underlining his) its worldwide customers. Tony was kind enough to provide a link to the video of Desi and a white coworker demonstrating the problem with the webcam software.
- It worked on the white woman–Wanda– by keeping her face centered, but as soon as Desi appeared in the frame, the cam locked in its normal position.
- What do we learn from this?
- 1. Remain calm. Frosty addressed the issue with a friendly, “everyone knows HP isn’t racist” attitude, without actually saying it. This defused the issue, as did the headline “Customer Feedback is Important to Us.”
- 2. Don’t go on the defensive. Frosty actually thanked Desi for bringing this to HP’s attention. He even linked to the video.
- 3. Don’t attack. HP probably could have drummed up some “see it works on these black people” videos, but did not. It also did not try to diminish Desi’s complaint, accepting it at face value.
- 4. Be human. Tony’s post was warm and friendly, but not too much so. It did not seem contrived, just friendly and matter-of-fact. If the post was lawyered, it didn’t show it.
- While I doubt Tony will be flying Desi and Wanda out to HP headquarters for a few beers in the Rose Garden, this was an issue that required a touch of diplomacy.
- Many less-confident companies would have somehow allowed the issue to explode in their faces.
- How would your company have done?

- Meet "Black Desi." He and his friend "White Wanda" made a video titled "HP computers are racist," which has been a viral hit in recent weeks. (See above.) In an attempt to prove their claim, Desi demonstrated that an HP MediaSmart computer's facial-tracking software could not follow the movements of his face, but it could do so just fine for his white friend Wanda.
- "As soon as White Wanda appears, the camera moves," Desi says in the video. "Black Desi gets in there — nope! No face recognition anymore, buddy."
- "I'm going on the record and I'm saying it," he continues. "Hewlett-Packard computers are racist."
- The video, which has attracted about 400,000 views as of this writing, is categorized as a humor clip. But HP has said it's taking the potential issue seriously.
- "HP has been informed of a potential issue with the facial-tracking software included on some of its systems, which appears to occur when insufficient foreground lighting is available,” an HP spokesman said in an e-mail. “We take this seriously and are looking into it with our partners.”
- The most entertaining part? The YouTube page proudly displays "Uploaded Using HP MediaSmart." Priceless.

- (CNN) -- Can Hewlett-Packard's motion-tracking webcams see black people? It's a question posed on a now-viral YouTube video and the company says it's looking into it.
- In the video, two co-workers take turns in front of the camera -- the webcam appears to follow Wanda Zamen as she sways in front of the screen and stays still as Desi Cryer moves about.
- HP acknowledged in a statement e-mailed to CNN that the cameras may have issues with contrast recognition in certain lighting situations. The webcams, built into HP's new computers, are supposed to keep people's faces and bodies in proportion and centered on the screen as they move.
- The video went viral over the weekend, garnering more than 400,000 YouTube page views and a slew of comments on Twitter.
- It was something neither Zamen nor Cryer expected to happen.
- Zamen said she and Cryer, her co-worker, were playing around with the computer at work and testing it when they stumbled upon the facial recognition feature.
- Cryer and Zamen said they were laughing when they realized the camera followed her and not him.
- "We thought it was pretty funny, we thought it was hilarious," Zamen said.
- So they made a video, which they planned to just share with friends on Facebook and YouTube. There was no script, no rehearsal, just two friends filming what they thought was a hilarious software glitch.
- So again, the two took turns in front of the camera.
- "As soon as my blackness enters the frame, it stopped," Cryer says in the video.
- "Black Desi gets in there, no face recognition anymore, buddy," he says.
- YouTube.com: Watch the video
- "I think my blackness is interfering with the computer's ability to follow me," he continues.
- But now that the video has gotten so much attention, the two co-workers want everyone, including HP, to know they never intended the video to spark a discussion about whether the webcam was racist.
- Zamen said she liked the computer so much, she suggested Cryer get one for his wife.
- "The intent was definitely not to go after HP, it just so happened the computer was an HP and we recognized the software glitch," Cryer said.
- "We did it for laughs, but if the video does make HP put out a better product, then great," Zamen added.
- HP was quick to react, too.
- The company quickly posted on the it's blog, TheNextBench.com, on Sunday after the video went viral, responding to concerns.
- "The technology we use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose," wrote Tony Welch, the lead social media strategist for HP's Personal Systems Group. "We believe that the camera might have difficulty 'seeing' contrast in conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting."
- TheNextBench.com: Read the statement on HP's blog
- Meanwhile, Welch pointed users facing similar problems to HP's help page, which provides guidance on how to change the lighting or other optimization settings on the camera.
- HP.com: See the HP help page
- On Monday HP also told CNN in a corporate statement that the issue is most likely related to lighting, but they are looking into the situation further.
- "HP has been informed of a potential issue with facial-tracking software. Consistent with other webcams, proper foreground lighting is required for the product to effectively track any person and their movements," the statement said. "As with all our products, we continue to explore refinements which help to optimize their use."
- Cryer and Zamen said they've heard similar feedback from commenters online offering ideas on fixing the lighting.
- The co-workers' video has also sparked others to try the product.
- After media coverage of the YouTube video, Consumer Reports did its own testing of the product to see if the YouTube video portrayal was accurate.
- ConsumerReports.org: Watch testing of the webcam feature
- In standard lighting, the webcam didn't move with an African-American male as it did with a white male. But after lighting sources were added, the webcam was able to track the African-American male's face and movements.
- CNN's Mythili Rao and Rachel Sherman contributed to this report.

- When Joz Wang and her brother bought their mom a Nikon Coolpix S630 digital camera for Mother's Day last year, they discovered what seemed to be a malfunction. Every time they took a portrait of each other smiling, a message flashed across the screen asking, "Did someone blink?" No one had. "I thought the camera was broken!" Wang, 33, recalls. But when her brother posed with his eyes open so wide that he looked "bug-eyed," the messages stopped.
- Wang, a Taiwanese-American strategy consultant who goes by the Web handle "jozjozjoz," thought it was funny that the camera had difficulties figuring out when her family had their eyes open. So she posted a photo of the blink warning on her blog under the title, "Racist Camera! No, I did not blink... I'm just Asian!" The post was picked up by Gizmodo and Boing Boing, and prompted at least one commenter to note, "You would think that Nikon, being a Japanese company, would have designed this with Asian eyes in mind." (See the top 10 gadgets of 2009.)
- Nikon isn't the only big brand whose consumer cameras have displayed an occasional — though clearly unintentional — bias toward Caucasian faces. Face detection, one of the latest "intelligent" technologies to trickle down to consumer cameras, is supposed to make photography more convenient. Some cameras with face detection are designed to warn you when someone blinks; others are programmed to automatically take a picture when somebody smiles — a feature that, theoretically, makes the whole problem of timing your shot to catch the brief glimpse of a grin obsolete. Face detection has also found its way into computer webcams, where it can track a person's face during a video conference or enable face-recognition software to prevent unauthorized access.
- The principle behind face detection is relatively simple, even if the math involved can be complex. Most people have two eyes, eyebrows, a nose and lips — and an algorithm can be trained to look for those common features, or more specifically, their shadows. (For instance, when you take a normal image and heighten the contrast, eye sockets can look like two dark circles.) But even if face detection seems pretty straightforward, the execution isn't always smooth. (See the 50 best inventions of 2009.)
- Indeed, just last month, a white employee at an RV dealership in Texas posted a YouTube video showing a black co-worker trying to get the built-in webcam on an HP Pavilion laptop to detect his face and track his movements. The camera zoomed in on the white employee and panned to follow her, but whenever the black employee came into the frame, the webcam stopped dead in its tracks. "I think my blackness is interfering with the computer's ability to follow me," the black employee jokingly concludes in the video. "Hewlett-Packard computers are racist." (See pictures of vintage computers.)
- The "HP computers are racist" video went viral, with almost 2 million views, and HP, naturally, was quick to respond. "Everything we do is focused on ensuring that we provide a high-quality experience for all our customers, who are ethnically diverse and live and work around the world," HP's lead social-media strategist Tony Welch wrote on a company blog within a week of the video's posting. "We are working with our partners to learn more." The post linked to instructions on adjusting the camera settings, something both Consumer Reports and Laptop Magazine tested successfully in Web videos they put online.
- Still, some engineers question how a webcam even made it onto the market with this seemingly glaring flaw. "It's surprising HP didn't get this right," says Bill Anderson, president of Oculis Labs in Hunt Valley, Md., a company that develops security software that uses face recognition to protect work computers from prying eyes. "These things are solvable." Case in point: Sensible Vision, which develops the face-recognition security software that comes with some Dell computers, said their software had no trouble picking up the black employee's face when they tested the YouTube video.

- Hewlett-Packard is looking into the facial-tracking software used in its personal computers after a customer calling himself “Black Desi” said the program was racist because it was unable to follow his movements.
- “I think my blackness is interfering with the computer’s ability to follow me,” Desi said in a YouTube video. In the clip, the software fails to follow the movement of his face — something it’s designed to do — while easily tracking the face of his co-worker, referred to as “White Wanda.”
- Hewlett-Packard said in a blog posting Sunday that it was examining the program, which is used for video chats. The software was designed to find faces by measuring the contrast between the eyes and upper cheek and nose, HP said. The camera may have difficulty seeing the contrast in low-light conditions, according to the Palo Alto-based company.
- “HP has been informed of a potential issue with the facial-tracking software included on some of its systems, which appears to occur when insufficient foreground lighting is available,” Mark Budgell, a spokesman for HP, said in an e-mail Monday. “We take this seriously and are looking into it with our partners.”
- The video, posted Dec. 10 under the title “HP Computers Are Racist,” has been viewed more than 86,000 times, according to YouTube. An e-mail to the YouTube channel used to post the clip wasn’t immediately returned.
- “Hewlett-Packard computers are racist. I said it,” Desi says, laughing with Wanda in the video, which is about two minutes long. “And the worst part is, I bought one for Christmas.”

- When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.
- 
- Recently the tech blogosphere caught on to a YouTube video where electronics store employees tested the webcam on an HP MediaSmart computer and found that, under their test conditions, the MediaCenter's Face Tracking feature did not recognize black faces, but did recognize white ones. In case you haven't seen:
- HP posted a response on its Voodoo Blog and asserted that poor lighting or possibly faulty algorithms are to blame. An admin nicknamed Frosty wrote:
- We are working with our partners to learn more. The technology we use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose. We believe that the camera might have difficulty “seeing” contrast in conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting.
- HP also advised users to see its webcam help page for assistance in adjusting the brightness and contrast settings.
- Since we have some HP notebooks around the office, I decided to test out these theories. I grabbed the HP Envy 15 and my co-workers Dana Wollman (who is white) and Jeffrey Wilson (who is black) to see which of us the Face Tracker was able to recognize.
- 
- At first, the Envy 15 (mistakenly identified as the Envy 13 in the video) tracked all of our faces accurately in a well-lit room, but the captured image was washed out and very bright. A quick look into the settings revealed that the Backlight Correction was set to 2 (the highest it will go), so I brought it down to 0. With Backlight Correction off, our picture looked more like the one in the YouTube video above. Plus, the Face Tracker no longer worked on Jeffrey, though it still worked on Dana and myself.
- See for yourself in the videos below. The first was filmed with no Backlight Correction, the second filmed with this feature turned on.
- Though it's obvious that the bias isn't racial in nature but instead based on lighting conditions and the camera's ability to distinguish between shadow and human face, this does bring up an interesting question: when testing this software, how many of the involved project members were dark-skinned? How many different lighting conditions were tested? The software was likely developed by a third party, not HP, so this is probably an issue on a number of webcams across several manufacturers. Perhaps this incident is an indication that the software makers should involve a greater pool of testers when designing these features.
- If you've got a webcam on your notebook that includes Face Tracking as a feature, we'd be interested to see your results. Turn the Backlight Correction on, then off. Fiddle with the brightness and contrast. See under what conditions the software is able to track you and which it isn't. Post links to your videos here, we'd be interested in the results.

- A man posted a YouTube video accusing Hewlett Packard's video chat software of being racist, reports CBS station KCBS in San Francisco. The African American man, referred to as "Desi," demonstrates on the video, titled "HP computers are racist," how the tracking software won't follow his face but will follow his co-worker's.
- "I think my blackness is interfering with the computer's ability to, to follow me," he says on the video. "I'm going on record and I'm saying it: Hewlett Packard computers are racist.
- CBS Technology Analyst Larry Magid says the problem is with the lighting and is not racial. HP responded in a blog post saying the problem occurs when there isn't enough light in the foreground.
- "I think that it could possibly be explained by the lighting, and the fact that black skin obviously is darker, and probably needs better lighting (for the program to work), that's true with any type of photography," said Magid.

- Some people take technical malfunctions with good humour. One of them is Desi, a black man, whose YouTube film about Hewlett-Packard's new MediaSmart webcam became viral after it showed that the camera can track users' face – except when they're black.
- In the entertaining video Desi and his white co-worker demonstrate the face-tracking software on Hewlett-Packard's MediaSmart computer. The camera is supposed to pan and tilt in response to users' movements, and it immediately follows Wanda, a white woman, but remains focused on a single point when Desi enters the frame.
- "As soon as my blackness enters the frame ... it stops," Desi says. "As soon as white Wanda appears, the camera moves. Black Desi gets in there? Nope, no facial recognition any more, buddy. I'm going on record and I'm saying it: Hewlett-Packard computers are racist."
- And Hewlett Packard's response? Rather commendable. Desi's tongue-in-cheek video has been taken seriously by the company, which announced in a blogpost that it would look into the issue, adding that other webcams can also struggle with lighting.
- "The technology we use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose. We believe that the camera might have difficulty 'seeing' contrast in conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting," Hewlett-Packard said.
- Despite the accusations, Desi seems amused not only by the problem but by the fact that he had bought one of the computers for Christmas just before he found out about it.
