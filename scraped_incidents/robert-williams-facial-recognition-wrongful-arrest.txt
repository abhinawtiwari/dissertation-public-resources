- Robert Williams, 42, was arrested in January 2020 for reputedly stealing five high-end watches at a store in Detroit in October 2018. However, Williams had been misidentified by facial recognition technology used by the Detroit Police Department, inflicting significant emotional damage on Williams and his family.
- A detective had used facial recognition technology on a grainy image from the store's CCTV  video, with the system flagging Williams as a potential match based on a driver’s license photograph. A security guard who had not been present at the incident then identified Williams in a photo line-up of Black males.
- Arrested in front of his family, Williams had been arrested, arraigned, detained for 30 hours and questioned in connection with a crime that took place in a store he hadn't visited since 2014. Prosecutors and police later apologised for how the case was handled.
- In April 2021, Williams sued (pdf) the Detroit Police Department for wrongfully arresting and jailing him. He was the first person known to have been arrested in the US because of a facial recognition failure.
- Detroit Police Chief James Craig had earlier admitted facial recognition technology misidentified suspects in 96 percent of cases.

- This article was published more than 2 years ago
- Robert Williams is a resident of Farmington Hills, Mich., and client of the American Civil Liberties Union.
- I never thought I’d have to explain to my daughters why Daddy got arrested. How does one explain to two little girls that a computer got it wrong, but the police listened to it anyway?
- While I was leaving work in January, my wife called and said a police officer had called and said I needed to turn myself in. I told her it was probably a prank. But as I pulled up to my house, a Detroit squad car was waiting in front. When I pulled into the driveway, the squad car swooped in from behind to block my SUV — as if I would make a run for it. One officer jumped out and asked if I was Robert Williams. I said I was. He told me I was under arrest. When I asked for a reason, he showed me a piece of paper with my name on it. The words “arrest warrant” and “felony larceny” were all I could make out.
- By then, my wife, Melissa, was outside with our youngest in her arms,  and my older daughter was peeking around my wife trying to see what was happening. I told my older daughter to go back inside, that the cops were making a mistake and that Daddy would be back in a minute.
- But I wasn’t back in a minute. I was handcuffed and taken to the Detroit Detention Center.
- As any other person would be, I was angry that this was happening to me. As any other black man would be, I had to consider what could happen if I asked too many questions or displayed my anger openly — even though I knew I had done nothing wrong.
- When we arrived at the detention center, I was patted down probably seven times, asked to remove the strings from my shoes and hoodie and fingerprinted. They also took my mugshot. No one would tell me what crime they thought I’d committed. A full 18 hours went by. I spent the night on the floor of a filthy, overcrowded cell next to an overflowing trash can.
- What changes do you hope will come out of protests and debates about police and race? Write to The Post.
- The next morning, two officers asked if I’d ever been to a Shinola watch store in Detroit. I said once, many years ago. They showed me a blurry surveillance camera photo of a black man and asked if it was me. I chuckled a bit. “No, that is not me.” He showed me another photo and said, “So I guess this isn’t you either?” I picked up the piece of paper, put it next to my face and said, “I hope you guys don’t think that all black men look alike.”
- The cops looked at each other. I heard one say that “the computer must have gotten it wrong.” I asked if I was free to go now, and they said no. I was released from detention later that evening, after nearly 30 hours in holding.
- I eventually got more information from an attorney referred to me by the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan. Someone had stolen watches, and the store owner provided surveillance footage to the Detroit Police Department. They sent that footage to the Michigan State Police, who then ran it through their facial-recognition system. That system incorrectly spit out a photograph of me pulled from an old driver’s license picture.
- Federal studies have shown that facial-recognition systems misidentify Asian and black people up to 100 times more often than white people. Why is law enforcement even allowed to use such technology when it obviously doesn’t work? I get angry when I hear companies, politicians and police talk about how this technology isn’t dangerous or flawed. What’s worse is that, before this happened to me, I actually believed them. I thought, what’s so terrible if they’re not invading our privacy and all they’re doing is using this technology to narrow in on a group of suspects?
- I wouldn’t be surprised if others like me became suspects but didn’t know that a flawed technology made them guilty in the eyes of the law. I wouldn’t have known that facial recognition was used to arrest me had it not been for the cops who let it slip while interrogating me.
- The ACLU is lodging a complaint against the police department on my behalf, but that likely won’t change much. My daughters can’t unsee me being handcuffed and put into a police car. But they can see me use this experience to bring some good into the world. That means helping make sure my daughters don’t grow up in a world where their driver’s license or Facebook photos could be used to target, track or harm them.
- Even if this technology does become accurate (at the expense of people like me), I don’t want my daughters’ faces to be part of some government database. I don’t want cops showing up at their door because they were recorded at a protest the government didn’t like. I don’t want this technology automating and worsening the racist policies we’re protesting. I don’t want them to have a police record for something they didn’t do — like I now do.
- I keep thinking about how lucky I was to have spent only one night in jail — as traumatizing as it was. Many black people won’t be so lucky. My family and I don’t want to live with that fear. I don’t want anyone to live with that fear.
- In response to request for comment from The Post, Nicole Kirkwood of the Detroit Police Department submitted this response: “The Detroit Police Department (DPD) does not make arrests based solely on Facial Recognition. Facial Recognition software is an investigative tool that is used to generate leads only. ... In reference to this case, an investigation was conducted. The investigator reviewed video, interviewed witnesses, conducted a photo line-up, and submitted a warrant package containing facts and circumstances, to the Wayne County Prosecutors Office (WCPO) for review and approval. The WCPO in return recommended charges that was endorsed by the magistrate/judge for Retail Fraud – First Degree." She also noted: “[T]his case predates our current policy, which only allows the use of the Facial Recognition software after a violent crime has been committed.”

- When the Detroit Police Department called Robert Williams, he thought it was a prank.
- The voice on the other end of the line told Williams to turn himself in at the DPD's Third Precinct. Why? The cop wouldn't say.
- "I can’t turn myself in if you can’t tell me," Williams recalls saying. "I said, 'If you want me, you can come to my house and bring a warrant.'"
- But it was late in his work day, and Williams was disturbed enough to head home, calling his wife, Melissa, as he drove. When she answered, the cops were already there.
- What Williams didn't know on that day back in January is that he had been misidentified by the Detroit Police Department's controversial facial recognition technology as a shoplifter who allegedly stole five watches from Midtown's trendy Shinola store in October 2018, making him the first person known to have been arrested because of a facial recognition failure.
- What happened next is baffling.
- The charges were ultimately dismissed, but not before Williams, 42, was arrested, arraigned, detained for 30 hours and questioned in connection with a crime that took place in a store he hadn't visited since 2014, a humiliating set of events Williams says neither he nor his wife and children have been able to really move past.
- And none of it had to happen.
- More: Detroit protesters take fight against facial recognition tech to city leaders' homes
- More: Detroit police oversight board approves controversial facial recognition policy
- Facial recognition technology is controversial precisely because of its high error rate in identifying non-white faces; because for 18 months, the department used it without a publicly vetted, Board of Police Commissioners-approved operating policy; and because critics fear it short-hands what should be a thorough investigative process.
- Williams could easily have proved that he wasn't the man in question — he was at work at his job at an automotive supplier when the reported theft happened. But DPD didn't ask, he said.
- Instead, officers arrived at his home on a quiet Farmington Hills street, cuffing Williams, who had no criminal record, and placing him into a squad car as his wife and young children watched.
- Wednesday, Williams, with the ACLU of Michigan and his lawyer, Victoria Burton-Harris, filed a complaint with the Detroit Police, asking the department and the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office for a series of corrective actions to repair the damage done to Williams' reputation — like removing Williams' image from the facial recognition database — and to halt the use of facial recognition technology altogether. The department's contract with facial recognition software provider DataWorks Plus, based in South Carolina, is up for renewal, and ending use of the technology has become an issue in the wave of protests against police brutality.
- Chief James Craig has contended that facial recognition is used in a thoughtful, deliberative manner, the equivalent of paging through a book of digital mugshots, and that leads are always vetted by a human analyst. In August 2019, Craig told reporters on a tour of DPD's Real Time Crime Center that the software had been used 500 times, and never resulted in a misidentification. Later that year, the Board of Police Commissioners adopted a policy to govern its use; the department now only uses facial recognition to identify suspects in violent crimes.
- But none of those policy changes helped Robert Williams.
- Williams was taken to the Detroit Detention Center, where he was processed and questioned, an experience so surreal that neither he nor Melissa can quite believe that it happened.
- While Williams was in custody, a DPD officer showed him an image taken from Shinola surveillance footage of a Black man in a red cap.
- "He turns over this picture and says, 'So that’s not you?' I laughed a little bit, because it looked nothing like me, and said, 'Nope, that's not me,'" he said. The officer presented two more pictures — neither of Williams.  "So I guess the computer got it wrong, too," Williams remembers the officer saying.
- It was the officer's offhand remark about the computer that let Robert and Melissa Williams start to understand what had happened, along with the couple's decision to reach out to the ACLU, and their ability to hire a defense attorney.

- More: I visited Detroit's real time crime center and learned about facial recognition software
- Information given at a hearing to Burton-Harris, who is running against Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, fleshed out the timeline, and that's also baffling. The reported theft happened in October 2018. Williams was misidentified by facial recognition software in March 2019. In July of that year, a Shinola security guard who had only seen footage of the theft identified Williams in a photo lineup. In January 2020, Williams was arrested.
- Detroit police offered the following statement Wednesday: "Due to the fact that this case is pending litigation, we cannot comment further. The Detroit Police Department does not make arrests based solely on facial recognition. Facial recognition software is an investigative tool that is used to generate leads only. Additional investigative work, corroborating evidence and probable cause are required before an arrest can be made."
- The ACLU said Wednesday that it had only filed a complaint with the department, not a lawsuit.
- Worthy notes that it was her office that opted to dismiss the charges once a review of the case revealed that there was insufficient evidence. And Worthy says she opposes the use of facial recognition software.
- "In the summer of 2019, the Detroit Police Department asked me personally to adopt their Facial Recognition Policy. I declined and cited studies regarding the unreliability of the software, especially as it relates to people of color. They are well aware of my stance and my position remains the same," she said in a statement.
- Worthy said her office requires review by a supervisor and corroborating evidence for any case that uses the technology.
- "This present case occurred prior to this policy. Nevertheless, this case should not have been issued based on the DPD investigation, and for that we apologize. Thankfully, it was dismissed on our office’s own motion. This does not in any way make up for the hours that Mr. Williams spent in jail," Worthy said in the statement.
- Burton-Harris says Worthy's office and DPD have either delayed or ignored requests for information about Williams' case. The charges against Williams were dismissed without prejudice, which means the case can technically be reopened. Burton-Harris says the prosecutor's office should dismiss with prejudice — meaning the case is closed — but Worthy's office says that's not legally possible unless "the statute of limitations has expired, or there is a legal bar to reauthorization, such as double jeopardy."
- ACLU attorney Phil Mayor said that while this is the first known case of a facial recognition misidentification, he doesn't think it's the only case. Williams, he notes, had the resources to fight it.
- "I think they need to do actual investigative work and not rely on a flawed computer system that’s racist and biased," Melissa Williams said. "I thought there were some steps before they came to your house to arrest you."
- Melissa Williams says she's a fan of cop shows, where determining a suspect's alibi consumes a lot of the action. But they didn't ask her husband for an alibi, she said.
- "And he had one! That could have cleared some things up."
- Robert Williams vividly remembers the day of his only visit to Detroit's Shinola store, back in 2014. Melissa Williams' brother had just moved to Midtown Detroit, and was eager to show his family the neighborhood, particularly the trendy Midtown shop.
- The family — Robert and Melissa, their new baby, and Melissa's brother and mother — walked down to browse the watches and bicycles the store is known for. He didn't buy anything. A watch enthusiast, Robert Williams prefers to wear a Breitling. But it was a fun family outing. They took pictures.
- He's never been back.
- That Williams was charged with a crime — even though those charges are dismissed — will show up in a simple background check. He had to explain to his employer what had happened. And he has to live with the humiliation of having been arrested in his front lawn, for all the world to see.
- "We live in a nice neighborhood ... my neighbors, one lady works for the Farmington Hills treasury office. The man across the street is an evidence tech in (the suburb's) police department. Then the people next door to me are teachers. And all of it happens at 5:30 in the evening while everybody's home. And by the way, I'm the black guy on the street, so when there's a Detroit police car sitting on the street, they know who he's there for."
- Robert and Melissa Williams say they and their children are still struggling to understand why this happened.
- "I’m not a thief. I do fairly well," Robert Williams said. "All I know for a fact is that I was arrested for no reason."

- DETROIT — A Black man who was wrongly arrested after the use of facial recognition technology by Detroit police will have his DNA, fingerprints and mugshot removed from law enforcement files, officials said Friday.
- Robert Williams was the victim of "shoddy investigative work," police Chief James Craig said.
- Williams, 42, was arrested in January in front of his family at their home in Farmington Hills. He was accused of stealing five expensive watches in 2018 at a Shinola store in Detroit.
- Williams' driver's license photo was wrongly flagged as a likely match to surveillance video at the store, the American Civil Liberties Union said.
- After approving a warrant, the Wayne County prosecutor's office dismissed the case earlier this year, noting that a Shinola security contractor who identified Williams in a photo lineup wasn't present at the time of the theft.
- "I will personally apologize" for the arrest, Craig told WDIV-TV. "It had nothing to do with the technology. But it certainly had everything to do with poor investigative work.
- "But there's a bright light in it," Craig said. "The third investigator assigned to this discovered problems. The video wasn't as clear as he felt it should be. The fact that he just didn't like the totality of the case. He notified the prosecutor's office. ... I applaud the detective who did it right."

- The police department is working to expunge the record and remove Williams' fingerprints, mugshot photo and DNA profile from files, said Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood, a spokeswoman.
- Craig, who described himself as a "strong believer" in facial recognition software, said the technology now is used only as a tool to possibly solve violent felonies in Detroit, not property crimes.
- The ACLU, which opposes the use of facial technology by police, publicized Williams' case.
- Mayor Mike Duggan, a former prosecutor, said he was "very angry" about how Williams was treated. He blamed it on "subpar" work by police and prosecutors but said the technology can be useful if handled properly.
- "What you need to do is make sure you have the right protocols," the mayor said. "Since September, there are a whole series of protocols in place that this incident would not have been possible."

- Robert Williams spent more than a day in custody at a Detroit detention center in January after an incorrect facial recognition match led to his wrongful arrest, in what the American Civil Liberties Union alleges is the first such case in the United States.
- It's an experience that has stayed with him.
- "I felt empty, I guess," Williams told NBC News in a television interview. "Humiliated is the only word that I can think of. I felt humiliated to be getting arrested."
- Williams, who is Black, had been mistaken for someone caught on surveillance video shoplifting from a Shinola watch store in Detroit in October 2018. Michigan state police had used facial recognition software from a company called DataWorks, which draws on algorithms from technology companies NEC and Rank One Computing, on the video.
- The system incorrectly flagged Williams' driver's license photo as a match, leading to his arrest. The American Civil Liberties Union alleges this is the first known wrongful arrest in the U.S. because of facial recognition technology.
- Williams was arrested in front of his wife and their young daughters in the driveway of his home and held in custody for close to 30 hours. He was released after officers told him the computer got it wrong, he said.
- He said he didn't know why he had been arrested, and investigators wouldn't tell him the specifics of his alleged crime — nearly $4,000 in shoplifted merchandise — until the next day.
- "I'm just locked up and don't know why I'm there," he said. "I was fingerprinted and mugshotted before anybody asked me one question ... It’s a rush to judgment."
- The complaint over Williams' experience follows widespread protests over the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, which have spurred nationwide scrutiny of the treatment of Black Americans by the police, as well as surveillance and policing tactics in general.
- Williams' arrest, which was first made public Wednesday, also comes as facial recognition technology is under intense scrutiny from technologists, activists and lawmakers as part of the larger movement to rethink policing in the U.S.
- Civil liberties and human rights groups, including the ACLU, have long criticized facial recognition software for having inherent racial and gender biases and infringing on constitutional rights. Williams also alleges that his arrest was due to racism.
- On Thursday, legislation was introduced in Congress that would ban the use of facial recognition and other biometric surveillance technology by federal law enforcement agencies. The bill also stipulates that state and local law enforcement agencies only receive federal funding if similar bans are enacted.
- IBM, Amazon and Microsoft all recently said they were pausing or abandoning their sale of facial recognition technology.
- Even though it was a wrongful arrest, Williams said he has yet to receive a personal apology for the incident. He said he gets goosebumps just thinking about how the arrest could have gone. Both he and his wife said they thought of other Black men who have died at the hands of the police while being arrested.
- "He’s a large, Black man and as we’ve seen over however many years, those interactions with police often don’t go well," his wife, Melissa, said. "It’s definitely something I've thought about and as it was happening was thinking about. He had every right to be argumentative or combative maybe even with as little information as we were given. He did stay very calm and I’m proud of him for staying very calm, but I don’t think we should have to say that we're lucky that he was in jail for 30 hours."
- The couple said they're also concerned about the "adverse effects" Williams' arrest may have on their young daughters.
- "After they pulled away with him in the police car, we came in the house and as soon as we came in the door, they looked out the window and I think it hit them that their daddy had just pulled away and they both started sobbing," Melissa said.
- Their oldest daughter nearly started hyperventilating and couldn’t do her homework without getting emotional since her dad usually helps her with it. The couple also said they’ll never forget how Williams missed a small but important milestone while in police custody.
- "I wasn't there for her first tooth," Williams said. "Even though it was one day, I still missed a milestone in her life."
- "When it's used improperly, we know it hurts people. When it's used correctly, we know that it just exacerbates an already racist, unjust criminal legal system."
- In a complaint filed with the Detroit police Wednesday, the ACLU requested that police stop using facial recognition. Williams' experience proves that "the technology is flawed and that investigators are not competent in making use of such technology," the organization said.
- Both Rank One and guidelines from Michigan state police say face matches should not be, nor are they intended to be, used as the basis for arresting an individual.
- "It is not accurate enough," Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said at a press conference Thursday. "Facial recognition is not definitive. It’s not DNA. It will give you three or four images, that’s a lead and from that lead you start to investigate."
- Duggan said the incident was a "really bad situation" that was "about subpar detective work and subpar warrant prosecutor work" but said it's inaccurate to say it reflects poorly on the facial recognition software.
- "I’m very angry about that case. My apologies to Mr. Williams," Duggan said. "There isn't anything else to say to a man who got arrested who shouldn't have been arrested, there isn't any excuse for it. But, in the early days of DNA testing there were these kinds of issues. In the early days of ballistics testing, there were these kinds of issues. What we need to do is make sure the technology is being used properly."
- "When it's used improperly, we know it hurts people," Williams’ lawyer, Victoria Burton-Harris, said. "When it's used correctly, we know that it just exacerbates an already racist, unjust criminal legal system. We do not need this extra layer that complicates these unjust outcomes."
- Burton-Harris said this technology should not be used and that Williams' case is a prime example of how unsafe and unreliable it is.
- NEC and DataWorks did not respond to requests for comment. But Rank One CEO Brendan Klare said the way his company's technology was reportedly used in Williams' case "goes against established industry standard best practices."
- In an email, Klare said, "Rank One unreservedly opposes any misuse of face recognition technology, including where a candidate match serves as the source of probable cause for an arrest."
- He added that Rank One will be including a legal way to revoke the use of its software when that use violates its code of ethics and it will be reviewing what other steps it can take to prevent misuse.
- On Friday, Detroit Police Chief James Craig also said that the department's new policies would have prevented this from happening. The department currently only uses facial recognition for violent crimes and home invasions, for example.
- Chief Craig maintains he is “a strong believer in the software,” adding the incident was the result of "poor investigative work" and had "nothing" to do with the technology.
- “Because of that shoddy work, it resulted in him getting arrested, so I will personally apologize for that,” said Chief Craig.
- When asked if the department would be disciplining the detectives involved in the faulty investigation, Craig said, “We’re dealing with that issue.”

- Detroit — Investigators are working to expunge the criminal records of a Michigan man who was mistakenly targeted through a facial recognition software after Detroit's mayor and police chief both stated his arrest was inexcusable.
- Robert Williams, a Detroit native who lives in Farmington Hills, was mistakenly tagged by the police department's software as a suspected shoplifter at Midtown's Shinola store, where five watches were taken, in 2018.
- Williams was arrested in January, without an explanation for his arrest, and held in police custody for 30 hours. He was arraigned on a first-degree theft charge and received a $1,000 bond after informing detectives their vague surveillance footage was not a match. Detectives realized "the computer got it wrong," and released Williams, he said. Charges were dropped by the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office for insufficient evidence.
- In addition to working with the prosecutor's office, Detroit police are seeking to remove Williams' DNA profile and mug shot from a state database, a representative told The Detroit News.
- The move comes a day after the ACLU of Michigan filed a complaint against Detroit police officials seeking a public apology to Williams' family and that the department abandons the facial recognition software stating it could lead to the wrongful arrest of another African-American man.
- The case might be the first of its kind and brings to light flaws in the use of the software that many police departments across the nation use or are considering using, civil attorneys say.
- Meanwhile, the city's mayor and police chief are speaking out about what led to the arrest, acknowledging it was a mistake.
- "What you need to do is make sure you have the right protocols, and since September there are a whole series of protocols in place that this incident would not have been possible," Mayor Mike Duggan said during a weekly press briefing at Detroit Public Safety headquarters. "But it’s unfortunate that it’s happened before Detroit had its own facial recognition, before it had its own policy, and there was really no excuse for Mr. Williams having been arrested."
- A loss-prevention officer reviewed the video footage showing a person wearing a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap. The videos were sent to Detroit Police Crime Intel for a search through facial recognition and a hit came back for Williams, a police report showed.
- Detroit detectives showed a six-photo lineup that included Williams to the loss-prevention worker, who identified Williams, according to the report. It took months for police to issue an arrest warrant and several more before they called Williams at work and asked him to come to the Police Department.
- Detroit officers arrested Williams in January while he was on the front lawn of his Farmington Hills home with his wife, mother-in-law and two young daughters, who cried as their father was placed in the police car. He was in custody overnight then arraigned, the ACLU said.
- The Wayne County Prosecutor's Office said the case was dismissed because the Shinola security official who was shown the photo line-up was not physically present during the crime.
- Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the investigation started while the department was still using Michigan State Police facial recognition software. DPD acquired its own system in 2017; however, policies were put in place in January to mitigate the flaws in the system.
- Craig blamed shoddy police work for Williams' arrest, not the system. He said discipline is being discussed for the three investigators involved in the case and personally apologized for the incident.
- “It had nothing to do with technology, but certainly had everything to do with poor investigative work,” Chief said Thursday. “But there is a bright light in it, the third investigator assigned to this, he discovered problems. The video wasn’t clear as he felt it should be. He felt more should have been done. He notified the prosecutor's office and they quickly responded.”
- During his Thursday press conference, Duggan said the city now has "a very stringent policy in place that has five separate protections that would have prevented this from happening."
- The mayor added, "I do not support facial recognition for surveillance. It is not accurate enough for moving images to match to anybody" and that it is solely used as a tool.
- The Police Department's two-year $1 million contract for the controversial software is set to expire in July. The Detroit City Council was expected to begin reviewing the administration's request to extend the contract through fall 2022 and increase funding for it, but the request was pulled last week amid uproar from the public concerned that the software could discriminate against people of color.
- A review of the industry’s leading facial recognition algorithms by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found they were more than 99% accurate when matching high-quality headshots to a database of other frontal poses.
- But trying to identify a face from a video feed, especially using the ceiling-mounted cameras commonly found in stores, can cause accuracy rates to plunge. Studies also have shown that face recognition systems don’t perform equally across race, gender and age — working best on white men, with potentially harmful consequences for others.
- Police "unthinkingly relied on flawed and racist facial recognition technology without taking reasonable measures to verify the information being provided," said ACLU attorney Phil Mayor in the complaint.
- "It conducted a shoddy and incomplete investigation, its officers were rude and threatening, and it has completely failed to respond to a FOIA request seeking relevant records."
- Duggan said advanced technology can be helpful to solving cases — like the Innocence Project, which uses DNA matching — if it's properly used.
- "When technology is used properly, by law enforcement officials, it can make sure that the innocent are cleared as well as that the guilty are convicted and what we need to do with facial recognition technology is follow those policies," he said.
- On Thursday, the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality said the software should not be used.
- “The arrest of Robert Williams is a travesty that shows in bas relief the bankrupt, backwards and inherently racist practice known as facial recognition. In this new era where the world has caught the fire of Black Lives Matter, practices like facial recognition are fast becoming obsolete," the group said in a statement. "The city of Boston has already banned it, and Fortune 500 corporations like IBM, Microsoft and Amazon are refusing to invest further in the technology, and have said they would no longer share their software with police departments.
- "Detroit needs to get on board."

- In January, Detroit police arrested and charged 42-year-old Robert Williams with stealing $4,000 in watches from a retail store 15 months earlier. Taken away in handcuffs in front of his two children, Williams was sent to an interrogation room where police presented him with their evidence: Facial-recognition software matched his driver’s license photo with surveillance footage from the night of the crime.
- Williams had an alibi, The New York Times reports, and immediately denied the charges. Police pointed to the image of the suspect from the night of the theft. It wasn’t him. “I just see a big black guy,” he told NPR.
- Williams spent the next 30 hours in custody before he was released on bail. With seemingly no other evidence of Williams’ involvement, police eventually dropped the charges. On Wednesday, Williams joined with the ACLU of Michigan to file a complaint against the Detroit Police Department, demanding they stop using the software in investigations.
- Williams' arrest may have been the first in the US to stem from faulty facial-recognition technology. But it wasn’t a simple case of mistaken identity. It was the latest link in a long chain of investigative failures that critics of how law enforcement uses facial recognition have warned about for years.

- Privacy scholars and civil liberties groups have criticized facial-recognition technology because, among other things, it is less accurate on people with darker skin. That’s led cities from San Francisco to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to ban or limit use of the tool; the Boston City Council voted to ban the technology on Wednesday.
- It’s best not to think of facial recognition as a single tool but as a multistep process that relies on both human and algorithmic judgment. Critics have spotlighted privacy issues at each step; in Williams’ case, the lack of safeguards led to an avoidable arrest.
- Michigan State Police used facial-recognition software to compare surveillance footage from the theft to a state database of 49 million images, including Williams’ driver’s license photo. People don’t knowingly opt in to having their images used this way, but half of all US adults have their photos attached to a database. Police around the US have also used social media photos, witness sketches, even 3D renderings to match against crime scene photos.
- The practice is especially pernicious when the databases include photos of people who were arrested but never charged or convicted of a crime. In New York, for example, police have come under fire for using mugshots from stop-and-frisk arrests as part of “probe photo” searches, even though stop and frisk was outlawed.
- Williams’ photo seemingly became the main lead in the case against him. The Michigan State Police report on the match says facial-recognition matches are “not probable cause” to arrest someone. The state police guidelines say facial recognition is not a “form of positive identification” and should be considered “an investigative lead only.”

- After the “match,” investigators sought evidence that would corroborate the case against Williams. The Times reports that police didn’t check Williams’ phone or if he had an alibi; instead, police asked an outside security consultant, who was not in the store at the time of the burglary, if he was the man in the surveillance footage. The woman’s answer was enough to prompt the arrest.
- While federal research has found that facial recognition often performs less accurately on darker skin, critics also contest the very definition of a “match.”
- The Times reports that when Williams’ photo was scanned, the software would’ve returned a list of potential matches alongside respective “confidence scores,” the algorithm’s projected likelihood that each photo was, in fact, the burglar in the surveillance footage. These confidence scores are important in facial-recognition matches. When the ACLU reported that Amazon’s Rekognition matched congresspeople to criminal databases, Amazon replied that the report used too low a threshold. Amazon said it considers 99 percent confidence a match; the ACLU set the confidence threshold at 80 percent.
- It’s not clear what confidence levels the Michigan State Police’s algorithm offered for the matches it returned.
- This is why the conversation has turned from regulation to moratorium—even when rules around corroborating leads are honored, police find ways around them. Critics fear that facial recognition will only automate and accelerate the worst abuses of the criminal justice system.
- Consider Ferguson, Missouri. In 2015, the Department of Justice alleged that the city’s police force targeted black drivers for traffic tickets as part of a revenue scheme that forced people into high fees that could lead to arrest warrants after a single missed payment. In a city equipped with widespread facial recognition, these drivers could be identified and threatened with arrest when they came in contact with a camera or an officer equipped with a body camera.
- Williams’ case is only the first known instance of mistaken charges filed due to facial recognition, but it’s possible there are others. It’s not clear how to improve a single investigative tool when it’s used by a largely ineffective system.
- Tech companies furnishing the software, like IBM and Amazon, have offered vocal support for police reform but are still taking a more moderate approach than the bans supported by activists, by temporarily halting sales to police while still lobbying for regulations that are, to many experts, ineffectual.

- A black man was wrongfully arrested after facial recognition software mistook him for a shoplifter, and now the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is filing a formal complaint against the Detroit police.
- Robert Williams of Farmington Hills, Michigan, was arrested on 9 January after facial recognition falsely linked him to an image of another person of colour at the crime scene, the ACLU said.
- Officers were looking for a watch thief, and the software, owned by the Michigan State Police, connected Mr WIlliams' driver licence picture with security footage of the thief.
- Mr Williams was arrested at his home, nearly 25 miles from Detroit, in front of his wife and his daughters, who are two and five.
- "I never thought I'd have to explain to my daughters why Daddy got arrested," Williams wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post. "How does one explain to two little girls that a computer got it wrong, but the police listened to it anyway?"
- During the arrest, his wife, Melissa Williams, asked where her husband was being taken.
- "Google it," the officer reportedly said to her.
- Mr Williams was detained for 30 hours. During questioning, officers showed him security footage from the robbery.
- "When I look at the picture of the guy, I just see a big black guy. I don't see a resemblance. I don't think he looks like me at all," Mr Williams told NPR.
- "(The detective) flips the third page over and says, 'So I guess the computer got it wrong, too.' And I said, 'Well, that's me,' pointing at a picture of my previous driver's licence," Mr Williams added. " 'But that guy's not me,'" he said, referring to the surveillance pictures.
- Mr Williams added he hoped police officers didn't think "all black people look alike".
- Mr Williams was eventually released on bail. At his court hearing, he was told by prosecutors that they were dropping the case against him.
- His case is the first known example of someone being wrongly accused of a crime due to facial recognition software, the ACLU claimed.
- Police admitted that he was arrested because of the facial recognition results, according to documents obtained by NPR, leading ACLU to file a complaint against the department.
- The ACLU is demanding an apology from the Detroit Police Department for the wrongful arrest.
- The group is also asking for the police department to stop using the technology to prevent future wrongful arrests against innocent people.
- "Robert Williams' is the first known case of someone being wrongfully arrested because of a bogus face recognition match," the ACLU said. "If lawmakers don't act now to stop law enforcement use of this technology, he won't be the last."

- The American Civil Liberties Union has filed an administrative complaint with Detroit’s police department over what the advocacy organization claims is the country’s first known wrongful arrest involving facial-recognition technology.
- According to the complaint, Robert Williams was pulling into the driveway of his home in Farmington Hills, Mich. one evening in January when a police vehicle suddenly drove up, blocking him in. Officers leapt out, placed Williams under arrest as his wife and children watched from their doorstep, and whisked him away to a detention center a half hour away in Detroit. There, he spent the next 30 hours in what his lawyers describe as a “crowded and filthy cell.”
- Detroit police believed Williams was responsible for stealing several watches from a local Shinola store. But it turns out the police were wrong—led astray by a computer algorithm, according to the ACLU. In a statement, the Detroit Police Department said facial recognition software is “an investigative tool that is used to generate leads,” and that it requires “additional investigative work, corroborating evidence and probable cause” before making an arrest.
- Tech companies push for nationwide facial recognition law. Now comes the hard part
- As the country reckons with decades of police practices that have disproportionately affected Black and brown communities, the incident hints at the personal toll wrought on average Americans by the rapid spread of facial recognition in policing — and the outsized potential for such technology to misidentify people of color.
- Facial recognition systems typically use software to match an image of a face with those stored in a database. The technology has been used everywhere from concerts to airports, but is increasingly being scrutinized by privacy and civil liberties advocates, technologists, and lawmakers over concerns about algorithmic discrimination.
- Williams, who is Black, has now become a face of that movement. According to the ACLU’s complaint, Detroit police provided the video surveillance of a Black man stealing watches from a Shinola store to Michigan state police, who ran the footage through a facial-recognition system and suggested a photo of Williams as a potential match. Shanon Banner, a spokeswoman for the Michigan state police, referred CNN’s questions about Williams’ case to the Detroit police.
- According to Banner, Michigan state police policy is not to use facial recognition as a form of positive identification.
- “It is considered to be an investigative lead only, requiring the investigator to continue the criminal investigation before making any final determinations, up to and including arrest,” she said. “All investigative lead reports include the following statement at the top of the report: ‘This document is not a positive identification. It is an investigative lead only and is not probable cause to arrest. Further investigation is needed to develop probable cause to arrest.’”
- Who owns the right to your face?
- Banner did not explain how the software, allegedly sold to state police by a company known as DataWorks Plus, suggested the man in the video was Williams. Nevertheless, police then showed a lineup of headshots, including Williams’s, to a Shinola security guard who hadn’t witnessed the theft but had watched the video. The guard, the complaint says, identified Williams as the suspect.
- Williams was subsequently arrested, though he was released after an interrogation during which, as the complaint says, “it became clear that his arrest was based on an erroneous facial recognition identification.”
- In a video produced by the ACLU about his experience, Williams said that once the officers interrogating him saw the pictures did not match his face, “they left them on the table and they looked at each other, like, ‘oops.’”
- “I never thought I’d have to explain to my daughters why Daddy got arrested,” Williams wrote in a Washington Post op-ed Wednesday. “How does one explain to two little girls that a computer got it wrong, but the police listened to it anyway?”
- The ACLU’s complaint about Williams’ experience follows announcements by several large tech companies that have said they will not sell facial recognition to police. Amazon has announced a one-year moratorium on sales of its Rekognition software, while Microsoft has said it will not sell its face recognition technology to police departments until federal regulations emerge. IBM, meanwhile, has announced a ban on “general purpose” facial recognition altogether, including research and development on the technology.
- AI software defines people as male or female. That's a problem
- It’s not known just how many local police departments use facial-recognition systems across the country, and there are few rules governing how and where it can be deployed. There is no federal legislation regarding its usage, though a number of states have enacted laws related to it. Illinois, for example, which requires companies to get consent from customers before collecting biometric information. And some cities, including Boston and San Francisco, have banned the technology for use by their governments.
- With its complaint, the ACLU said, Williams hopes the Detroit Police Department will, among other things, publicly apologize to Williams and his family. The complaint also seeks all records from the department related to Williams’ arrest, and calls on Detroit police to stop using facial recognition as an investigative tool.
- In the surveillance footage used by police, the real suspect wore a St. Louis Cardinals hat, according to the complaint.
- “Mr. Williams, a lifelong resident of the Detroit area, owns no such hat, and is not a Cardinals fan,” the complaint said. “He’s not even a baseball fan. He is, however, Black.”

- Detroit police have used highly unreliable facial recognition technology almost exclusively against Black people so far in 2020, according to the Detroit Police Department’s own statistics. The department’s use of the technology gained national attention last week after the American Civil Liberties Union and New York Times brought to light the case of Robert Julian-Borchak Williams, a man who was wrongfully arrested because of the technology.
- In a public meeting Monday, Detroit Police Chief James Craig admitted that the technology, developed by a company called DataWorks Plus, almost never brings back a direct match and almost always misidentifies people.
- “If we would use the software only [to identify subjects], we would not solve the case 95-97 percent of the time,” Craig said. “That’s if we relied totally on the software, which would be against our current policy … If we were just to use the technology by itself, to identify someone, I would say 96 percent of the time it would misidentify."
- Todd Pastorini, a general manager at DataWorks Plus, told Motherboard that it does not keep statistics on the software's accuracy in real-world use, and it does not specifically instruct law enforcement how to use the software.
- "There's no statistics for that," Pastorini said. "The matter is the quality of the probes used. I’m very reluctant based on the last New York Times article I was misquoted or slightly misrepresented based on the context that was used. You might know how a shovel works—you stick it in the ground to pick up dirt and you might use it as a weapon. Facial recognition has been weaponized by the media to some degree. I understand the chief’s comment, but unfortunately many people don’t."
- Pastorini likened DataWorks Plus' software to automated fingerprint identification systems, where dozens or hundreds of potential matches are returned. It "does not bring back a single candidate," he said. "It's hundreds. They are weighted just like a fingerprint system based on the probe [and what's in the database]."
- The result of this, according to Detroit's own police officers, is that they are ultimately making the decision to question and investigate people based on what the software returns and a detective's judgment. This means that people who may have had nothing to do with a crime are ultimately questioned and investigated by police. In Detroit, this means, almost exclusively, Black people.
- So far this year (through June 22), the technology had been used 70 times, according to publicly released data by the Detroit Police Department. In 68 of those cases, the photo fed into the software was of a Black person; in two of the cases, the race was listed as 'U,' which likely means unidentified (in other reports from the police, U stands for unidentified); the Detroit Police Department did not respond to a request to clarify. These photos were largely pulled from social media (31 of 70 cases), or a security camera (18 of 70 cases).
- Several cities have banned police from using facial recognition software, which has well-known racial bias issues (and many false-positive issues as well). Detroit, however, has a very public debate in 2019 about the use of facial recognition, and instead decided to regulate its use rather than ban it altogether. Late last year, the city adopted a policy, which bans the use of facial recognition to “surveil the public through any camera or video device,” bans its use on livestream and recorded videos, and restricts (but does not ban) its use at protests. According to the policy, the software must be used only “on a still image of an individual,” and can only be used as part of an ongoing criminal investigation. The software checks images across a state database of photos, which include mugshot images. As part of these regulations, the police department is required to release weekly reports about the use of the technology, which show that it has been almost exclusively used on Black people.
- Williams was arrested before the policy went into practice. Craig said during the meeting that the media it ran through DataWorks’ facial recognition system was “a horrible video. It was grainy … it would have never made it under the new policy … if we can’t obtain a good picture, we’re not going to push it through to the detective.”
- Craig and his colleague, Captain Aric Tosqui, said that they want to continue using facial recognition because they say it can be a tool to assist investigators even if it doesn’t often lead to arrest. But even when someone isn’t falsely arrested, their misidentification through facial recognition can often lead to an investigator questioning them, which is an inconvenience at best and a potentially deadly situation at worst. According to Tosqui, the technology has been used on a total of 185 cases throughout the years. “The majority of the cases the detective reported back that [the match] was not useful.”
- Despite these problems, DataWorks Plus said that it does not guide law enforcement on how to best use the software. "We don't tell our customers how to use the system," Pastorini said. "There’s already law enforcement policies. It is my experience the clearer the image, clearly is going to affect the likelihood of a more solid result."
- The Detroit Police Department did not respond to a request for further comment. In recent months, there has been a new movement by city council members to ban the use of the technology.
