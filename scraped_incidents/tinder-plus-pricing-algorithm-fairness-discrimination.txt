- Research studies reveal Tinder has been charging users over 30 and gay and lesbian aged 18-29 more than others in multiple countries, generating accusations of systemic age and sexual discrimination.
- A February 2022 study by Consumer Reports finds users aged 30+ are being charged over 65% more than others in New Zealand, Brazil, India, the Netherlands, South Korea and the US.
- The findings are supported by research by Which?, which discovered that the dating app has been increasing prices for gay and lesbian users aged 18-29 in the UK.
- An August 2020 study by CHOICE had found users in Australia were being charged up to five times as much as others, with older people charged more.
- Tinder uses personalised algorithmic pricing for every user, based on an estimation of what they are willing and able to pay. However it refuses to reveal how its pricing system works.
- Facing public petitions and multiple legal threats, Tinder says it stopped the practice of charging users different prices based on how old they are in the US and Australia.
- Tinder’s parent company Match Group revealed in an earnings call last week that it would stop the practice in remaining markets.

- Tinder turns 10 years old this year and as our business grows ever more global and the category evolves, we have continued to evolve our Premium Features.  While Tinder is free to use, a growing number of members choose to upgrade to our Premium Features. We regularly give updates on this topic in the Match Group earnings calls, it has been a while since we’ve talked about all the ways Tinder’s Premium Features are evolving here.
- For the past few years, we have offered three tiers of subscription (Tinder Plus, Tinder Gold and Tinder Platinum) as well as a la carte features like Super Like and Boost, which will remain the foundations of our Premium Features.  This year, we are testing ways to take some of our most popular subscription features - like See Who Likes You and Passport - and offer them on an a la carte basis.  We think an expanded set of a la carte features will give all our members more ways to find a Tinder experience that fits their budget and their needs.
- When we launched our first subscription we wanted to offer younger members a lower price point than the standard price, to make Tinder affordable for those in school or early in their careers. Age and market were the only factors taken into account to determine pricing. Members 28 years and younger were able to purchase discounted subscriptions, and people in India, for instance, would see different prices from members in the US. Sexual orientation, gender, race, religion, or any other demographic characteristic have never informed, influenced or determined pricing at Tinder. And most importantly, it never will.
- Last year we discontinued offering lower prices for younger members in the US, Australia, and more recently in the UK. We recently announced that we will be eliminating age based pricing for all of our members in all markets by the end of Q2 this year.
- We’re excited about the future and how our Premium Features can help our members stand out and find the meaningful connections they’re seeking.

- Last week Tinder’s parent company quietly revealed in an earnings call that it would stop charging users around the world different prices based on how old they are.
- The dating app is free to use, but if your best selfies aren’t getting the matches you want, you can pay for short-term boosts or ongoing subscriptions to stand out in the swiping crowd.
- Age appeared to be a significant factor driving the prices that different users saw for Tinder Plus, the lowest subscription tier, according to a new international case study released today. The study says Tinder prices also seemed to vary with other factors, including sexual orientation, gender, and location, but the data was not statistically significant.
- Tinder says it eliminated age-based pricing in the U.S. and Australia last year, and in the U.K. in 2022. The company says the practice will stop worldwide by the end of June.
- The company denies that gender, sexual orientation, or any other social or demographic data has ever played a role in pricing at Tinder.
- However, users may “still see some small variations in pricing” depending on the platform they’re using to access Tinder, or when the company does price testing, according to a spokesperson for Match Group, which owns Tinder and several other dating apps. The company didn’t provide details about why Tinder is ending age-based pricing.
- The new study recruited 96 Tinder users per country in Brazil, India, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, in addition to the U.S., between May and September 2021. The study also recruited 48 users in South Korea; researchers say they recruited only heterosexual-identifying users in that country to avoid potential risks to participants.
- Users then documented the price they were quoted for a one-month subscription to Tinder Plus, which unlocks extra swipes and an undo button.
- Different participants saw widely varied prices, both within countries and across borders. Such pricing “is likely achieved through an algorithm, using a combination of data points to determine what price to offer to each individual consumer,” according to the study, which was conducted by Consumers International (a consortium of organizations that includes Consumer Reports) and the Mozilla Foundation.
- Seven in 10 Americans oppose personalized pricing, 49 percent “strongly,” according to a nationally representative survey of 2,341 adults by Consumer Reports (PDF) conducted in September 2021.
- Such pricing appears to be widespread online, but companies rarely inform consumers when they are being charged different amounts for the same products. Experts say that lack of transparency can give companies an unethical advantage.
- “It’s unfair because consumers don’t know that it’s happening,” says Jeffrey Moriarty, the executive director of the Hoffman Center for Business Ethics at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass. "They’re playing the game by rules that you don’t know about and have not agreed to because they’re doing it without your knowledge.”
- Certain variations in pricing, such as student and senior discounts, are legal, but some other forms of price discrimination are against the law. “Typically it’s been found to be illegal when price discrimination is based on things like race, gender, age, religion, marital status, national origin, or disability,” says Robert Weiss, a partner at the law firm Barnes & Thornburg in Chicago who specializes in information technology law.
- The latest research follows two studies that found similar price differences on Tinder, one conducted in Australia in 2020 and another in the U.K. that was released about two weeks before Tinder announced its pricing policy change. In a press release, Tinder says it had offered price discounts “to make Tinder affordable for those in school or early in their careers.”
- In most countries covered by Consumers International’s study, people in their 30s and 40s were quoted higher prices than any other age group. In the U.S. their average price was 42.4 percent higher than the price for adults under 30.
- People older than 49 saw slightly lower prices on average—much more than 20-somethings, but a bit less than folks in their 30s and 40s.
- The age gaps were even higher elsewhere. Dutch Tinder users ages 30 to 49 were quoted more than twice as much on average as younger users in the CI study.
- When Tinder Plus launched, age discrimination for the subscription wasn’t a secret. In the U.S., swipers older than 30 paid $19.99, while younger users paid $9.99.
- Following the rollout, a Tinder user sued the company for age discrimination under California state law. Tinder eventually agreed to settle the class-action lawsuit for $24 million; the terms of the settlement were recently overturned by an appeals court. Tinder didn’t admit wrongdoing, but it promised in 2019 to stop the practice for users in California.
- The Consumers International study found no statistically significant evidence that gender or sexual preference were related to pricing. However, in the U.S., men who participated in the study saw an average price 6.5 percent higher than women. Americans outside of major cities were quoted 11.5 percent more than people in major metropolitan areas.
- In the U.S., prices were barely different at all for people with different sexual orientations. However, in the Netherlands, Dutch users looking for opposite-gender partners were quoted prices 10.6 percent higher than people seeking partners of the same gender.
- The study also found that overall prices for Tinder Plus varied by country. Dutch users saw the highest average price at $16.46, while Brazilian users saw the lowest at $3.49.
- Computer scientists say algorithms can use a vast array of ever-changing data points to set prices, and can yield effects that the companies using them didn’t intend. According to the study, “​​Even assuming gender or sexual preference are not deliberately factored into Tinder’s pricing algorithm, there is potential for unintentional discrimination if specific demographics are consistently being charged more than their counterparts.”
- Tinder says that no social demographic information has ever been used to set prices on the platform. “The allegations that Tinder uses gender identity and sexual orientation to set prices is absolutely false,” says a Match Group spokesperson.
- Companies often keep the inner workings of their pricing decisions secret. Consumers International recommends that companies and regulators work to make those decision-making processes public. “Businesses must make it clear to consumers when and how personalized pricing is being used, while governments and regulators must establish and enforce such transparency requirements,” the study says.

- Tinder pricing algorithm discriminates against older users in New Zealand.
- New research from Consumers International and the Mozilla Foundation has found that Tinder Plus users over thirty are paying 65 percent more than their younger counterparts on average to swipe right. The research looked at pricing from New Zealand, Brazil, The Netherlands, South Korea, the USA and India.
- These pricing differences continue even after Tinder faced at US$24 million lawsuit for unfair pricing based on age in California.
- “Algorithm-based personalised pricing is when a business charges people different prices for the same goods or service. To figure out how much you’re charged, the service accesses your personal data. The question is, when is it appropriate for different people to be charged different amounts? Why is it okay for Tinder to charge users different prices, but for a company like Bumble to have set pricing?” said Dr Cherie Lacey, Consumer NZ investigative lead.
- The study showed, on average across the six countries, 30–49-year-olds were charged 65.3 percent more than 18–29-year-olds. Personalised pricing is not a new concept and can be done in a fair and transparent way. However, without full transparency from Tinder, it’s hard to explain the reasoning behind such pricing.
- This makes it difficult for consumers signing up for the services to have transparency about the price they were quoted. In New Zealand the highest prices quoted were between four to six times more than the lowest price.
- “We know that Tinder is using age as a mechanism to set prices, but without full transparency from Tinder, it's hard to explain the reasoning behind the pricing. The research found that pricing is very complex, with New Zealand users quoted up to 25 unique price points for the same service,” said Dr Lacey.
- Consumers were surveyed about personalised pricing and algorithmic discrimination with 56 percent citing data privacy as a top concern, while 33 percent highlighted the potential unfairness of charging different prices to different people.
- Jake (not his real name) is 51 years old, lives in Wellington and has been a Tinder Plus member on and off for five years, until six months ago.
- “When I signed up for Tinder Plus, I had no idea that they used personalised pricing algorithms. The app didn’t say anything about how pricing might differ between users. I’m concerned about what sorts of personal data the app does access about me. It raises serious issues about privacy.”
- 51-yr-old Jake’s Tinder Plus price is more than double that of a 26-yr-old user in the same region.
- “It should be clearly communicated to users when they sign up for Tinder Plus. It’s a matter of algorithmic transparency and the ethical use of data. For me, it’s about allowing the user to make an informed decision.”

- Allan Candelore had a problem with Tinder Plus prices, and made it known. He sued the company behind the dating app for discrimination. It was 2015.
- In a California trial court, Tinder argued there was no problem. The company was charging users over the age of 30 twice as much for its premium service than for users under 30, it said, because younger people are "more budget-constrained".
- Tinder argued that Allan's case should be dismissed because age-based pricing wasn't arbitrary, unlawful or unfair, and didn't suggest "irrational, invidious stereotypes". The court agreed.
- But Allan, who was in the older cohort and had paid more for Tinder Plus, still sensed an injustice. His lawyers set out to prove it.
- In 2015, Tinder was already an international phenomenon. The free app allowed users to browse the profiles of other users in their area and reject or connect with them in one fell swipe of a finger – to the right to start chatting, to the left to pass.
- That year, the company launched Tinder Plus, which had extra features such as the ability to undo swipes and look for matches in other areas. The cost to unlock these features? For users below the age of 30, $US9.99. For users over 30, $US19.99.
- Lawsuits followed in California, where the company is based. People were upset to learn that their age could come with a surcharge.

                    Global report reveals Tinder Plus price discrimination rampant
- Age-old debates
- In 2018, Allan's case went before an appeals court. This time, the judges ruled in his favour, invoking California civil rights law: customers had to be treated as individuals rather than as members of a group based on attributes such as gender, race or age.
- They noted rulings that upheld differences in treatment based on age: higher interest rates on bank deposits for seniors, cheaper movie tickets for children. The justification: social policies that match, such as retirement for the elderly and restrictions on child employment.
- But Tinder's pricing model, they said, for which the price point changed at age 30, amounted to prohibited arbitrary discrimination.
- Tinder had the highest worldwide consumer spend of all non-gaming phone apps in 2019, beating Netflix
- The judge who wrote the ruling pointed out that Tinder's argument could be used to justify "higher prices for all consumers 30 and older in even the most essential areas of commerce – such as grocery shopping, gasoline purchases, etc. – even in instances where an individual did not in fact enjoy the economic advantages that are presumed about his or her age group".
- Tinder argued that the decision was misguided. In an appeal to the California Supreme Court, the company wrote that its pricing model was benign, and that the ruling "will have far-reaching and negative economic consequences both for young people trying to find their financial footing and for a wide variety of businesses and organisations serving young people".
- Furthermore, it said, the decision "imperils a host of common discounts for young adults never before thought to be suspect – from young‐lawyer fee discounts in bar associations to college‐student discounts for movie tickets".

                    Op-ed: Tinder's misuse of data leaves a lot to be desired
- But the analogies don't quite fit. Students can be different ages, so a mature-age student can access movie tickets at student prices. And bar associations are made up of only one profession: lawyers, who reliably start on much lower salaries than later in their careers.
- Last year, Tinder settled another case in California over the same issue. The company again denied any wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement.
- But it made payouts to Tinder Plus subscribers who paid the higher prices, and agreed to stop charging new subscribers over the age of 30 more for its services than those under 30 – at least in California. The app could still offer discounts to people under 21.
- Despite the lawsuits and some disapproving press over its pricing, business is booming for Tinder. According to mobile data analytics firm App Annie, Tinder had the highest worldwide consumer spend of all non-gaming phone apps in 2019, beating Netflix, which came in second. In Australia, Tinder ranks among the top-grossing apps on iPhones, and smartphones that use Google Play.
- To find out more about the app's prices in Australia, we got 60 people to sign up to Tinder. We set quotas based on gender, sexuality (using the Tinder categories "straight" and "queer"), location and age group (18–29, 30–49 and 50+). The shoppers logged these attributes along with the prices they were shown for Tinder Plus.
- We commissioned a mystery shopping agency to conduct the fieldwork, which started in the last week of February, 2020 and finished mid-March, 2020.
- The mystery shoppers were asked to sign up to Tinder (if they hadn't already) and take screenshots of the prices of Tinder Plus, as well as information on their profile page.
- Quotas were set based on gender, age group, location and sexuality.
- A total of 60 mystery shops were done.
- The difference between the lowest and the highest price was huge. A straight male over 50 in a metropolitan area was given the price of $34.37 for one month – almost five times as much as a queer female under 30 in a metropolitan area, who was offered the same service for $6.99.
- On average, people over the age of 30 were offered prices that were more than double those given to people under 30, as in the US.
- However, there were also large price variations within these age groups, ranging from $6.99 to $16.71 in the under-30 cohort and $14.99 to $34.37 in the over-30 one. We didn't see a pattern that could explain these differences.
- 
- Mystery shop of Tinder Plus
- Prices for one month:
- $6.99 for a queer female under 30 in a metro area (lowest).
- $7.99 and $15.10 for a queer male under 30 in a metro area.
- $13.82 and $16.71 for a straight male under 30 in a regional area.
- $14.99 and $30.44 for a queer male aged 30-49 in a regional area.
- $27.53 for a straight female over 50 in a regional area.
- $27.18–$30.60 for a straight female aged 30-49 in a metro area.
- $34.37 for a straight male over 50 in a metro area (highest).
- On average, prices for people over 30 were more than double prices for those under 30.
- Note: These are just some of the prices we saw. You may get a different price.
- 
- Tinder didn't respond to our repeated requests for an interview with its chief marketing officer, Jenny Campbell, or its country director for Australia, Kristen Hardeman, to discuss these prices and how they appear to contravene Australia's discrimination laws.
- Nor did it respond to questions we put in writing asking how the company sets its prices for Tinder Plus, why it charges different prices for different people, and why it charges older people more than it charges younger people. We also tried to connect with Campbell and Hardeman on LinkedIn, asking to discuss the pricing of Tinder Plus. Neither has responded.
- In the past, a spokesperson for Tinder was reported saying that prices were based on a combination of factors, including what the company learnt through testing, such as that certain price points were suited to certain age groups.
- This kind of pricing model is discriminatory and would fall foul of Australia's anti-discrimination laws
- Shortly after Tinder Plus was rolled out, Tinder's co-founder, Sean Rad, told a tech conference: "Our intent is to provide a discount for our younger users." There were groans from the audience, reportedly.
- Although Tinder has defended its tiered pricing by saying it's all about opening up access to young people, elsewhere the company has said it's actively targeting the youth market.
- In June, Tinder CEO Elie Seidman did an interview with The Verge in which he said the company is focusing on how to keep attracting young people to the app. He said Tinder is the only dating platform that is "focused entirely, with all of our energy, on 18 to 25, on Gen Z".
- Paul Harpur, an expert in anti-discrimination law, thinks a case like the ones brought against Tinder in California could be won in Australia.
- Paul Harpur, an expert in anti-discrimination law at the University of Queensland, says getting a person to pay more for an app because they're older is direct discrimination based on age.
- "There is no reason a person at 25 should be able to access the app cheaper than a person who is 55," he says. "This kind of pricing model is discriminatory and would fall foul of Australia's anti-discrimination laws."
- Under the
Age Discrimination Act 2004, Tinder would need to have justifiable grounds on which to charge the older group more than the younger one for its pricing to be legal. Harpur is doubtful that such reasons exist.
- "If they made it cheaper for seniors they could be justified because they've got less money," he says. But the idea that all people over the age of 30 have more money than those under 30 is "interesting", he says, because there are many people for whom this simply isn't the case.
- "There's a lot of people out there who start their careers and finish their careers at the same pay rate," he points out. "Also, when I was 25 I had more money, essentially, because I had no responsibilities. Now I've got a kid. A lot of people's disposable income would actually go down over time."
- Harpur thinks a discrimination case like the ones brought against Tinder in California could be won in Australia. He notes that many of our discrimination laws are based on US laws. "So if you get a discrimination suit in America, there's a reasonable chance you'd at least get a hearing here," he says.
- The practice of charging people different prices for the same product is quite common. It's called price discrimination, and it's a company's attempt to capture differences in people's willingness to pay for a product, and thereby maximise profits.
- In many cases the practice is lawful, but it may be unlawful if it's based on unjust or prejudicial treatment of different groups of people, which is what an appeal court in California decided Tinder was doing.
- Economists tend to refer to three types of price discrimination. Third-degree price discrimination involves sorting consumers into groups based on perceived willingness to pay, using an observable characteristic. Child fares, student tickets and seniors' rates would fall under this category – as would Tinder's age-based prices, in part.
- Businesses can now run vast swathes of our data through algorithms to determine how much each of us, individually, is willing to pay
- Second-degree price discrimination provides discounts for bulk purchases, giving consumers the option to choose a different price per unit depending on quanitity – a 48-pack of toilet paper versus a six-pack, for instance, or a season pass for theatre tickets versus individual plays.
- As for first-degree price discrimination, this is where you figure out the highest amount an individual is willing to pay and charge them accordingly. It's the most profitable way of setting prices. Auctions and haggling at a market were once among the best attempts at this.
- But the scope of first-degree price discrimination has been expanding rapidly alongside the amount of information about us that's being gathered. Information is key, since how accurately you can predict what someone will pay depends largely on how much you know about them.
- Without a set of ground rules on how data about us should be used, technological innovation has so far been a free-for-all. This has produced a range of valuable services, often free to users – but we've paid instead with our attention and personal information.
- "The volume of user data collected from consumers worldwide is growing exponentially," the ACCC wrote in the final report of its digital platforms inquiry last year. "According to an IBM estimate, 90 percent of all the data that exists in the world today was created in the past two years."
- Businesses can now run vast swathes of this data through algorithms to determine how much each of us, individually, is willing to pay for something. According to a 2018 report by Deloitte and Salesforce, 40% of retailers that use artificial intelligence to personalise customers' experiences use it to tailor pricing and promotions in real time.
- One possible explanation for the price variations within age groups for Tinder Plus is an attempt by the company at first-degree price discrimination (on top of its use of third-degree price discrimination based on age).
- David Tuffley, a senior lecturer in applied ethics and cyber security at Griffith University, is wary about big data in the hands of insurance companies. While the unprecedented access to personal information can make risk assessments more accurate, he says, it also comes with the potential for abuse.
- Information such as where a person shops, what they buy and how much they spend – which can be gleaned from payment transactions, browsing history and location data – can help an insurer predict whether they would be willing to pay top price for cover, he says.
- "It doesn't take that long before a pretty accurate picture emerges from a person's daily, weekly, monthly spending habits," Tuffley says. "That's a starting point for a whole series of assumptions about that person that can be deduced."
- He says insurance providers can work out which people are particularly risk-averse based on the lifestyles that emerge from their transaction data, social media activity and other information, and charge those people less for cover because they're less likely to make claims.
- But he says insurers may instead decide to charge those people more for cover, because their aversion to risk might make them willing to pay a higher price for insurance.
- Tuffley thinks the use of big data to set prices is becoming more widespread. "If you can do it with insurance, you can do it with almost anything else," he says. "The whole field of marketing, because it's worth billions, if not trillions of dollars every year, there's a lot of effort going into perfecting these sorts of tools."
- He says this brings with it "a whole lot of privacy concerns … and that's the big issue to be resolved at the moment. We don't hear enough about what's going on, about what [companies] are doing. So they might well be doing questionable things but we wouldn't necessarily know about it."
- One of the key findings of the ACCC's digital platforms inquiry was that companies often leverage information asymmetries to their own benefit, while preventing consumers from making informed choices.
- Information asymmetries are when one party has more relevant information than the other in a transaction.
- Our mystery shop of Tinder Plus didn't reveal pricing patterns beyond broad age groups, but individual users of the app would know even less about the prices they're shown.
- When users tap an icon within the free app that says 'Get Tinder Plus', prices pop up for a 12-month, six-month or one-month subscription. There's no indication that these prices differ from anyone else's.
- Because each person doesn't know what information Tinder may be using about them to set the price, and are likely to believe they are seeing the same price as everyone else, Tinder is free to personalise its prices without much scrutiny.
- Netflix could increase its profits by 12% if it adopted personalised pricing based on people's web browsing behaviour
- This information asymmetry between companies and their customers is a big part of what makes first-degree price discrimination effective and profitable for companies.
- If you know you'll be charged more on one website or app than another because of certain factors, you can choose to spend your money at the cheaper site. If you don't know this, you're more likely to accept whatever price you're given.
- The Consumer Data Right (CDR), set to be rolled out in Australia's banking, energy and telecommunications sectors, is meant to act as a counterbalance to information asymmetry.
- The CDR lets consumers use data about their own behaviour and needs to better compare products and services. However, it relies on the idea that prices between products and services are easy to understand and compare. If personalised prices like we appear to be seeing with Tinder become more common, this may be harder to do.
- As media reports have made clear, there are times when this happens in annoying though seemingly harmless ways – airlines tweaking the price of flights depending on where and when a person wants to fly, as well as where and when they search for them, for example.
- A few years ago, if you booked a ride on Uber, the fare would be based on distance and time and only go up with local demand. Then Uber changed the algorithm to better predict a person's willingness to pay, incorporating factors such as the wealth of their destination suburb.
- When users tap an icon within the Tinder app that says 'Get Tinder Plus', there's no indication the prices shown differ from anyone else's.
- The impact of an algorithm can be dramatic, especially in dollar terms. Orbitz, a travel site, was reported showing Apple Mac users more-expensive travel options after determining they would spend up to 30% more a night on hotels.
- In 2016, Benjamin Shiller, an assistant professor in economics at Brandeis University in the US, estimated that Netflix could increase its profits by 12% if it adopted personalised pricing based on people's web browsing behaviour.
- This would clearly be a boon to Netflix – less so for the consumers who'd be left paying double the price for the same service, which is what Shiller calculated some would pay.
- Even small pricing manipulations tend to leave people feeling duped.
- In 2000, for example, BBC News reported that Amazon had been charging higher prices for DVDs to frequent shoppers than new visitors of the online store.
- Four in five people are concerned about businesses using data on our online habits to offer a higher price for a product
- "By deleting the cookies that Amazon had left on their computer, or using a browser that did not accept cookies, some customers found they were getting much bigger discounts," BBC News reported. (Cookies are online files that store information about a user's interaction with a webpage.)
- "The implication was that Amazon was offering bigger discounts to first time visitors to tempt them back."
- Amazon's explanation? The prices were assigned randomly as part of the retailer's regular tests of consumer behaviour. Nevertheless, the company refunded the people who paid more.
- But there are times when personalised pricing has gone further, and in concerning ways.
- In 2008, a credit card company settled allegations made by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that it had failed to disclose the way it rated people's credit risk.

                    What are loyalty schemes like Flybuys and Everyday Rewards doing with your data?
- The company had determined that people who used their cards to pay for therapy, marriage counselling or tyre-repair services were a higher credit risk, based on the repayment histories of its other customers.
- "Using this type of a statistical model might reduce the cost of credit for some individuals, but may also result in some creditworthy consumers being denied or charged more for credit than they might otherwise have been charged," the FTC wrote in its 2016 report on big data.
- Our latest national Consumer Pulse survey, which ran in June, shows that four in five Australians are concerned about businesses not being transparent when it comes to the different prices they may be giving to different people. Four in five people are also concerned about businesses using data on our online habits to offer a higher price for a product.
- A quarter aren't aware that organisations can use their personal data to give them a higher quote for a product than they do for someone else.
- That's not to say that personalised pricing can't be used to do good. For instance, some may see it as socially beneficial to charge wealthy people more for a product and charge people struggling financially, less.
- But there's an important distinction to make in all of this: instead of working out how much we can afford to pay, first-degree price discrimination is about finding out how much we're willing to pay.
- It's a point that Harpur illustrates with this example: say a company trawls through your posts on Facebook. From that, it can "make a lot of assessments about what I would be interested in," Harpur says. "But then also [the company] could say, 'He'll pay more' or 'He might have a lot of money but he's a cheapskate, he won't spend it'."
- Price discrimination… may allow businesses, particularly monopolies, to take more of the benefit that would otherwise go to consumers
- One group of people might "talk about fine wine and others talk about cheap goon, even though they have money – if [companies] know that, they might decide how to price things [based on that information]," he says.
- The ACCC addresses this issue in its report. "Some consumers may gain from increasingly personalised pricing – for example, consumers with limited ability to pay may be offered a lower price for products they otherwise could not afford," the commission writes.
- "However, many consumers are likely to pay more, particularly in circumstances where consumers have limited choice of who to buy from, or have a limited inclination to shop around."
- "Price discrimination… may allow businesses, particularly monopolies, to take more of the benefit that would otherwise go to consumers through these higher prices", the ACCC says.
- On average, Tinder Plus is more than twice the price for people over 30 than for those under 30.
- Without knowing the full list of factors that influence the prices people get for Tinder Plus, we're unable to judge whether the use of such factors is fair or even correct.
- Harpur thinks there needs to be greater transparency around how companies, including Tinder, are using data and algorithms to set prices, to ensure these systems aren't creating harmful inequalities in society.
- "If we don't know what's happening and we aren't sure how these inequalities are caused – because it is an inequality, when one person's paying more than another – then we can't assess whether the inequality should be a concern," he says.
- If we don't hold everyone to reasonable requirements around transparency and ethics, an insurance company, hypothetically, would be free to use sleep data from your fitness tracker and the sad songs you've been listening to on Spotify as a basis for charging you extra to get mental health cover.
- It's also conceivable that a dating site might try to wring more money from you after you've read a few articles about coping with loneliness. Or that a dating app might tailor its prices based on the clientele it wants to attract, leaving unwanted users priced out or unwittingly paying more – although that situation doesn't quite need imagining.
- We've made a formal complaint to the ACCC asking the regulator to investigate Tinder for potential breaches of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL).
- This is because Tinder doesn't make clear that it uses people's data to set personalised prices. The closest thing to an attempt we found was deep in the wells of the privacy policy on its website, in a separate link to an FAQ page on profiling and automated decision-making at Tinder.
- Near the bottom of that page is this sentence: "We also use information about you to deliver offers and discounts tailored to your profile." In our complaint, we argued that most people wouldn't interpret this to mean that Tinder uses their information to set personalised prices.
- We wrote that the lack of transparency around how Tinder uses people's data to determine prices is misleading and deceptive conduct by omission and a use of unfair contract terms under the ACL.

- Tinder pricing algorithm discriminates against older
users in New ZealandNew research from Consumers
International and the Mozilla Foundation has found that
Tinder Plus users over thirty are paying 65 percent more
than their younger counterparts on average to swipe right.
The research looked at pricing from New Zealand, Brazil, The
Netherlands, South Korea, the USA and India.These
pricing differences continue even after Tinder faced at
US$24 million lawsuit for unfair pricing based on age in
California.“Algorithm-based personalised pricing is
when a business charges people different prices for the same
goods or service. To figure out how much you’re charged,
the service accesses your personal data. The question is,
when is it appropriate for different people to be charged
different amounts? Why is it okay for Tinder to charge users
different prices, but for a company like Bumble to have set
pricing?” said Dr Cherie Lacey, Consumer NZ investigative
lead.The study showed, on average across the six
countries, 30–49-year-olds were charged 65.3 percent more
than 18–29-year-olds. Personalised pricing is not a new
concept and can be done in a fair and transparent way.
However, without full transparency from Tinder, it’s hard
to explain the reasoning behind such pricing.This
makes it difficult for consumers signing up for the services
to have transparency about the price they were quoted. In
New Zealand the highest prices quoted were between four to
six times more than the lowest price.

didn’t say anything about how pricing might differ between
users. I’m concerned about what sorts of personal data the
app does access about me. It raises serious issues about
privacy.”

communicated to users when they sign up for Tinder Plus.

use of data. For me, it’s about allowing the user to make
an informed decision.”

- Checked for accuracy by our qualified fact-checkers and verifiers. Find out more about fact-checking at CHOICE.
- In 2020 we had 60 people sign up to Tinder accounts and discovered that in Australia, the popular dating app charges older people more to access its services.
- Our investigation also found that other forms of discriminatory pricing were routine across the platform.
- Our findings were consistent with earlier reporting on Tinder's practices in the US state of California, where its price discrimination has given rise to a number of lawsuits.
- And now a global consortium of consumer rights groups has used our mystery shop methodology to survey six other countries, and discovered Tinder's price discrimination practices extend across the globe.

                    How cashback sites use your data
- Our 2020 investigation caught the attention of Consumers International (CI), of which CHOICE is a longstanding member.
- The organisation has reported the findings of a broader investigation in collaboration with Mozilla Foundation (which describes itself as a nonprofit software community and is behind the Firefox browser).
- It found that older Tinder Plus users in India, the Republic of Korea, the US, the Netherlands and New Zealand are "unknowingly paying more".  Brazil was the only country of the six examined where age apparently didn't play a part in pricing.
- Nearly six million people across the world use Tinder Plus and are potential unknowing victims of this discrimination
- In the five affected countries, people aged 30–49 and 50-plus were quoted substantially more on average than those aged 18–29. On average across the six countries, 30–49 year olds were charged 65.3% more than 18–29 year olds.
- In line with our 2020 investigation, the CI project also revealed that prices can change according to other factors, due to an "incredibly complex" price-setting mechanism that seemingly draws on age, "and other unknown factors, possibly including data points beyond those provided upon registration".
- Cl found the same kinds of price discrimination globally as in Australia.
- "Nearly six million people across the world use Tinder Plus and are potential unknowing victims of this discrimination," CI says in a statement, adding that the practice "is concealed by a lack of meaningful access to the pricing algorithm, limiting the ability to investigate and audit".
- For Consumers International, as well as for CHOICE, the issue of online pricing discrimination goes well beyond dating apps.
- Tinder is just one example among many that leave consumers at the mercy of invisible pricing mechanisms over which they have no control.
- 
- "Consumer associations, other think tanks, and enforcement and supervisory bodies should be given meaningful access to the algorithms that determine personalised pricing in order to establish if the practice is fair and where unfair discrimination is occurring," says Helena Leurent, director general at Consumers International.
- "Consumers must be given greater agency over the use and dissemination of their personal data collected for personalised pricing purposes, while measures must be introduced to uphold data protections for all," Leurent says.

                    Tinder charges older people more
- Tinder Plus users are left in the dark about their pricing mechanisms.
- The research team also surveyed consumers about personalised pricing and algorithm-driven discrimination.
- Almost every respondent expressed concern about the practice, particularly around data privacy and the unfairness of charging some people more than others.
- "In the supermarket, everyone sees the same price for the same product," says CHOICE senior policy advisor Amy Pereira.
- "But when we hop online or onto an app like Tinder, we see different prices for the same thing. The worst part is, we don't know why these prices are different or what factors feed into them, let alone how to challenge them."
- 
- Pereira says businesses need to come clean about their pricing practices.
- "Businesses like Tinder owe it to their customers to be upfront and honest with their pricing, in the same way that those customers have been honest and upfront with the personal information they've entrusted to the business, hoping for it to not be used against them."
- Businesses like Tinder owe it to their customers to be upfront and honest with their pricing
- Some users see prices as high as $28.99 per month to access Tinder Plus
- In a 2020 national CHOICE survey,  four in five Australians said they were concerned about businesses not being transparent about offering different prices to customers based on the data they hold, and the same percentage expressed concern about businesses collecting data about our online habits and using it as a basis for price discrimination.
- Despite the Consumers International findings, a Tinder spokesperson tells CHOICE that the company "has never factored in sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other demographic characteristic to our pricing", adding that it recently "decided to move away from our aged-based pricing policy that provided a lower price subscription for our younger members aged 18 to 28".
- According to Tinder, it has already discontinued aged-based pricing in the US, UK, Brazil and Australia.
- But a quick check by a number of CHOICE staff of different ages and other demographics revealed that prices for premium options such as Tinder Plus and Tinder Platinum continue to vary. Why that's the case is impossible to say due to Tinder's hidden pricing system.
- Correction 10 February 2022: An earlier version of this story stated that  gender, sexuality and location were potential factors in Tinder's pricing. That reference has been removed because the findings were not statistically significant in the Consumers International report.

                    Op-ed: Tinder's misuse of data leaves a lot to be desired
- Our 60 mystery shoppers signed up to Tinder in categories based on gender, sexuality (using the Tinder categories "straight" and "queer"), location and age group (18–29, 30–49 and 50+).
- On average, people over 30 were offered prices more than double those offered to people under 30.
- But price variation occurred across the spectrum, in ways that defied any clear pattern.
- Prices ranged from $6.99 to $16.71 a month in the under-30 cohort and $14.99 to $34.37 in the over-30 one, for instance.
- When we got in touch with Tinder to ask about its pricing policy, the company didn't respond.
- Paul Harpur, an expert in anti-discrimination law at the University of Queensland, told us as the time that Tinder's practices in the Australian context are a clearcut case of age discrimination.
- "There is no reason a person at 25 should be able to access the app cheaper than a person who is 55," he says.
- "This kind of pricing model is discriminatory and would fall foul of Australia's anti-discrimination laws."

- Which? accuses the popular dating app of breaking data protection law.
- Online dating is tough — and potentially costly, depending on your age.
- People over the age of 30 have to cough up more to use the premium features of dating app Tinder, according to a study by British consumer group Which?
- Tinder, which has surged in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, charges for additional functionality, such as giving users an unlimited number of likes, or letting them match with people located in other countries.
- The consumer group used almost 200 mystery shoppers to create profiles on the dating app. Users aged 30 to 49 paid 48 percent more than younger users, while those over 50 faced a 46-percent-higher bill.
- The study did not find price differences between genders, people of different sexual orientations or users living in rural or urban locations.
- The findings of Which? “show a clear pattern and the effects are big enough to make real-world differences to consumers using the app,” said Katie Alpin, head of strategic insight at Which?
- Which? accuses Tinder of using opaque and unpredictable algorithms, and not letting users provide explicit consent to their personal data being used to determine prices.
- The consumer group has filed a complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to investigate further.
- “Organisations must use personal data lawfully, fairly and transparently. That means organisations must only use people’s data in ways they would reasonably expect, and be clear with people about why they need their personal data and what they will do with it,” a spokesperson for the ICO said in a statement. The authority has said it has received Which?’s report and will “assess the information provided.”
- A spokesperson for Tinder said the price difference can be explained by the company’s “discounts in some regions, including the U.K., for members aged 28 and younger.”In a blog post, Tinder said it has “never factored in sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other demographic characteristic to our pricing.”
- Tinder has faced fire from consumer groups before. In 2019 it settled a class-action lawsuit in California for charging users aged 30 and over double the standard premium fee. The company pledged to stop the pricing practice in California, but not elsewhere. In 2020, Australian consumer group Choice found that over-30s were charged more than double that of younger users.
- “We need firms to face up to the fact that if you're using complicated pricing algorithms, you need to be ready to defend those. The important thing is that we have a system where firms can be held accountable when their pricing practices result in unfairness and potentially unlawful practices,” Alpin said.
- Alpin said Which? is also concerned about similar practices that are happening in the insurance market.
- “These kinds of pricing practices are potentially going to be a bigger issue going forward as more and more companies choose to use complicated forms of personalized pricing,” she continued.
- CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect that Which? withdrew its allegations that Tinder’s algorithms discriminated against gay and lesbian users.

- A new study by the Mozilla Foundation and Consumers International has found that the dating app Tinder charges users dramatically different prices for access to its premium Tinder Plus service. The study raises key questions about how the personalized demographic data of app users (like age, race, gender, and sexual orientation) might be used to create discriminatory “differential pricing,” both in dating services and beyond.
- The study, which builds on findings from UK consumer watchdog group Which? and Australian consumer organization Choice, did not find statistically significant price differences based on race, gender, or sexual orientation. It did, though, reveal that older users were charged more for Tinder Plus, which allows users unlimited likes and the ability to reverse your last swipe. It found extensive variation in the prices offered to test consumers: In the Netherlands, 96 test users were quoted 31 different prices for the same service, with prices ranging from $4.45 to $25.95. Researchers also found correlations that they described as “worthy of further investigation” — for example, straight participants in the Netherlands were quoted 10.6% more than LGBTQ participants, and men in the United States were quoted 6.5% more on average than women.
- A Tinder spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that the company has never considered sexual orientation, gender, race, religion, or any other demographic characteristic when determining prices, and that the wide range of prices shown to users were likely the result of randomized tests.
- But while Tinder denied that the variety of prices Mozilla and Consumer Choice found had anything to do with demographic information, it is one of few companies that has publicly embraced “personalizing” pricing based on age. In 2015, the company launched explicit age-based pricing tiers for its premium service and has faced pushback from consumers ever since. In 2019, the company agreed to pay $23 million to settle a class action age discrimination lawsuit brought by California users over age 28, who were charged twice as much as younger users for the company’s subscription services. As a condition of the settlement, Tinder agreed “to substantially halt [its] discriminatory practices,” at least within the state of California. In August 2021, the 9th Circuit undid the settlement, but the company plans to end its “age-based discounts” going forward. The researchers were not aware of any other major dating apps — many of which are owned by the same company, Match Group — that have offered explicit age-based pricing.
- The Tinder spokesperson compared the company’s age-based prices to discounts for young people and older adults at places like movie theaters and museums. However, ending explicit age tiers does not appear to address the huge price differences that Mozilla and Consumer Choice found in their study.
- Tinder is not the only company that has toyed with using data mined from consumers’ devices to personalize pricing — though most have stayed away from protected demographic traits. In 2012, Orbitz began showing customers browsing on Mac computers higher hotel prices than comparable customers browsing on PCs, because the company found that Mac users were, on average, willing to pay more for hotels. In 2016, Uber’s head of research told NPR that riders were willing to accept up to 9.9 times a normal fare when their phone batteries were low (a metric the app tracks so that it knows when to go into battery-saving mode), but said the company does not consider phone battery level when setting prices. Last year, an app called Smash began offering grocery discounts for people between ages 13 and 24 — and requires its users to submit a selfie in order to pass a “facial age scan.”
- This type of price personalization has led to concern among regulators. In 2012 — and again in 2018 — the UK government opened investigations into companies using data collected from consumers online to charge “personalized” prices for their products. In 2015, the Obama White House published a report on the issue, which raised concerns, but found that “we have not yet entered an era of widespread personalized pricing.” In 2018, however, a study conducted by Deloitte and Salesforce found that of 500 surveyed companies, 40% had used AI to “tailor pricing and promotions in real time.”
- Ashley Boyd, Mozilla’s VP of advocacy who directed the research on Tinder Plus, said that the consumers her team interviewed want more transparency into companies’ pricing schemes. But until more research is done or companies decide to be more open, pricing will stay "a bit of a black box."
